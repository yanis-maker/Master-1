In an interview to ABC on Thursday, Wally Adeyemo, the Biden administration’s second-highest official in the Treasury Department, has commented on the ongoing shortages of consumer goods that have led many to mock the president as ‘Empty Shelves Joe’.  Despite viral photos depicting thousands of cargo ships lined up at the Port of Los Angeles ready to unload their goods, Adeyemo claimed that the supply chain issues plaguing so many US retailers are an international issue and will only let up when a sufficient percentage of the country has been vaccinated.  Also on rt.com #EmptyShelvesJoe trend dominates Twitter as ships back up at ports and Biden administration blames… Trump?  Describing the disastrous economic conditions as “an economy that’s in transition,” Adeyemo acknowledged that “we are seeing high prices for some of the things that people have to buy.” While he praised the administration’s stimulus payments, he also argued that people all over the world should get jabbed in order for the economy to get back on track.  The reality is that the only way we’re going to get to a place where we work through this transition is if everyone in America and everyone around the world gets vaccinated.  While the ABC reporter repeatedly suggested that the country’s shortages of toilet paper and other panic-buy items could be traced to international supply chain disruptions, a growing number of Americans are demanding answers regarding the weirdly specific nature of certain products missing from store shelves. Some have even voiced doubt concerning whether the shortages are being introduced deliberately, either to gin up hatred against the unvaccinated or keep Americans economically off-balance as they grow accustomed to the wild disruptions of the pandemic.  Adeyemo did the Biden cabinet no favors by adding fuel to the conspiratorial fire, explaining the primary reason Biden continued to push for everyone to be vaccinated was that only then could the White House “provide the resources the American people need to make it to the other side” of the supply chain problem.  Despite blaming the international shipping industry for empty shelves in the US, the media establishment has acknowledged that the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach - which together process 40% of the nation’s imports - had their busiest years on record last year, giving the lie to the notion that the products missing from American shelves simply don’t exist. However, many truckers working for shipping companies have balked at the idea of mandatory vaccination, leaving their firms’ fleets woefully understaffed, and others have gone on strike to demand better working conditions.  Also on rt.com How Covid catastrophizing & a colossal crimewave are causing America’s second Great Retail Panic  The Biden administration has attempted to address the supply chain problem by calling for the Port of Los Angeles to run 24 hours, but while he praised his own promised move as a “game changer,” the executive director of the port has made it clear that there is no timetable in place for the promised schedule shift. Meanwhile, Biden’s cabinet has come across as woefully out of touch - White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain, for example, pooh-poohed the issue of empty shelves as a “high class” problem earlier this week, eliciting criticism from both Left and Right. And Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg has been quietly vacationing on paternity leave since mid-August, leaving the country without even a semblance of logistical oversight as the cargo clog shows no signs of dissipating.  Labor shortages are being felt far beyond the US, though often for similar reasons. In Italy, thousands of protesters turned out to block cargo ships from unloading their bounty earlier this week. The demonstrators were outraged over the country’s adoption of a mandatory vax-to-work policy similar to that threatened by the Biden administration. And the UK government has begged lorry drivers to return to work, even luring foreign drivers in with temporary visas as the country frets over its own empty shelves issues.  Australian ‘truckies’ have united with other unions to exert pressure on the government, which has kept cities like Melbourne under lockdown for months despite vanishingly few reported cases of Covid-19. The government was already floating policies like ‘no jab, no job’ over a year ago and has led the way in leveraging the pandemic to turn Five Eyes ‘democracies’ into police states.  Like this story?

On Friday, Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee signed Executive Order 83, which authorizes National Guard and State Guard troops to break into peoples’ homes, kidnap them at gunpoint, and take them to covid internment camps, all without any due process or respect for civil rights. Individuals can be targeted for this medical kidnapping by armed troops via “telephone assessments,” and the medical kidnapping of American citizens is being labeled “involuntary commitment” to “temporary quarantine and isolation facilities.”  In other words, FEMA-style concentration camps are here, and covid is the excuse for mass arrests and executions of Americans.  The Tennessee EO is on top of the CDC’s announcement that covid camps will be set up on a nationwide basis, with people being medically kidnapped and taken to “humanitarian settings” where they will be forced into labor pools, just like a scene ripped right out of Nazi Germany.  Upon learning that concentration camps are now being authorized in the United States, the average American is expressing shock and disbelief that this so-called “conspiracy theory” turns out to be official government policy. As reported by WorldNetDaily.com, social media users are responding with comments like:  Wow! The guard will be utilized? Involuntary commitment?

3,264019763253447756851916399533799891538,"(Natural News) There’s a secret layer of information in your cells called messenger RNA, that’s located between DNA and proteins, that serves as a critical link. Now, in a medical shocker to the whole world of vaccine philosophy, scientists at Sloan Kettering found that mRNA itself carries cancer CAUSING changes – changes that genetic tests don’t even analyze, flying completely under the radar of oncologists across the globe.  So now, it’s time for independent laboratories that are not vaccine manufacturers (or hired by them) to run diagnostic testing on the Covid vaccine series and find out if these are cancer-driving inoculations that, once the series is complete, will cause cancer tumors in the vaccinated masses who have all rushed out to get the jab out of fear and propaganda influence. Welcome to the world of experimental and dirty vaccines known as mRNA “technology.”  Previously unknown cancer driving messengers are hiding in RNA, not DNA  This mind-blowing discovery should be published on every medical news site, newspaper, television news broadcast and on the CDC website, but unless you are reading this article and use DuckDuckGo as your search engine, you probably wouldn’t ever see it. That’s because Google is in on the fix, with Big Pharma and the VIC – the vaccine industrial complex. So here’s a more in-depth explanation of what we’re looking at, for real, regarding mRNA and vaccines.  The information carrying molecule, messenger RNA, can instruct human cells ultimately in the same way as cancer drivers, playing a major role in causing cancer to thrive while inactivating natural tumor-suppressing proteins the human body creates to save you from cancer. This is the complete opposite of what the CDC and the vaccine manufactures are telling everyone right now about the Covid vaccines, and this is based on clinical research by molecular biologists at the Sloan Kettering Institute.  Even sequencing the DNA in cancer cells doesn’t reveal these changes, that’s how sneaky the vaccines are. It’s like a Trojan horse that tells your cells to allow these changes to be made, as if they were safe, but they’re not. All assumptions being made about mRNA being ‘safe’ right now have been completely turned 180 degrees with this research. Consider this very carefully if you have not yet been vaccinated with mRNA technology, and you may want to ‘lawyer-up’ if you already got the jabs.  After your Covid vaccination, RNA is transported out of your cell’s nucleus, and will no longer function properly as a cancer tumor suppressor  Bill Gates and the Vaccine Industrial Complex are very sinister, as we all know, but to create vaccines that truncate (disable by cutting short) cancer tumor suppressors, and destroy the human body’s ability to protect against cancer, well, that’s just complete insanity. Truncated tumor-suppressor proteins are similar to the DNA mutations that cause cancer cells to mutate and multiply uncontrollably. Will America see cancer cases skyrocket over the next few years due to Covid vaccines? Only time will tell, but right now, science is revealing that it’s likely. Pay close attention.  Therefore, anyone who is scared to death of the Covid vaccines is pro-science rather than anti-science, because the science shows the mRNA technology is very dangerous, especially concerning proteins that fuel cancer tumors. Let’s say that again: Science shows mRNA technology can fuel cancer tumor growth.  Substantial amount of people with blood cancer have the SAME inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes at the mRNA level  Scientists also discovered that a substantial amount of people with blood cancer, a.k.a. chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), have the same exact inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes at the mRNA level. In fact, the mRNA changes they detected could possibly account for the missing DNA mutations, and that spells out bad news for everyone who thinks the Covid vaccine series is “safe and effective.” It’s effective alright, at suppressing anti-cancer proteins, one might conclude.  Even if just half (partial truncation) mRNA changes in human cells take place, it’s enough to “completely override the function of the normal versions that are present,” according to the Sloan Kettering team of scientists. These changes can also apply to 100 different genes at the same time, so the changes can add up quickly and cause horrific health repercussions. Of course, mainstream media will dismiss any connections made by these discoveries, but they’re paid to regurgitate pharma talk, so that’s not surprising at all.  It is important to note that mRNA changes, according to researchers, are not limited to blood cancer, but have been linked to acute lymphatic cancer and breast cancer. Could this mean we’re looking at a new population control mechanism hidden in messenger RNA?  About 20,000 people in the US develop “CLL” chronic lympthocytic leukemia each year. How many will quietly begin developing it now, and then have it suddenly “show up” five years from now? Symptoms include fatigue, enlarged lymph nodes, and night sweats. Did you get mRNA vaccinated and experience those symptoms already? Are those symptoms on the warning label – the vaccine insert? Did you read them?  There’s only one “treatment” offered right now for CLL by the Pharma Industrial Complex, and that’s stem cell bone marrow transplantation. Oh, but it’s only recommended if your CLL is “likely” to advance. Do your mRNA vaccines now qualify you as “likely” to advance with CLL?

Although, scientific evidence supporting facemasks’ efficacy is lacking, adverse physiological, psychological and health effects are established. It has been hypothesized that facemasks have compromised safety and efficacy profile and should be avoided from use. The current article comprehensively summarizes scientific evidence[s] with respect to wearing facemasks in the COVID-19 era, providing proper information for public health and decision making.  The study concludes (emphasis added):  The existing scientific evidence[s] challenge the safety and efficacy of wearing facemask as preventive intervention for COVID-19. The data suggest that both medical and non-medical facemasks are ineffective to block human-to-human transmission of viral and infectious disease such SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, supporting against the usage of facemasks. Wearing facemasks has been demonstrated to have substantial adverse physiological and psychological effects. These include hypoxia, hypercapnia, shortness of breath, increased acidity and toxicity, activation of fear and stress response, rise in stress hormones, immunosuppression, fatigue, headaches, decline in cognitive performance, predisposition for viral and infectious illnesses, chronic stress, anxiety and depression. Long-term consequences of wearing facemask can cause health deterioration, developing and progression of chronic diseases and premature death.

Be sure to get the TRUTH by subscribing to our email list. It’s free.  With the current irrational push to vaccinate the planet against COVID-19, a virus that has a 99.9% recovery rate, we feel it is important to discuss practical ways to “detox” and “neutralize” damage that is being done by these untested mRNA vaccines.  Interestingly, here in our home state of Tennessee, the COVID “mortality rate” has tripled, even though we lead the USA in vaccination rate. Makes you wonder, doesn’t it? Logical thinkers would deduce that the vaccine is responsible, sort of like when we see obesity rise in populations that eat lots of ice cream. But the irrational and illogical ‘mainstream media’ and ‘medical mafia’ will undoubtedly blame “anti-vaxxers” for the increase in deaths, which makes as much sense as blaming vegans for the increase in heart disease in people who eat hot dogs every day…  But let’s not get distracted by the facts or by logic!!  Despite the $4.5 billion in damages awarded by the Vaccine Court since 1986 …  Even though the Supreme Court described vaccines as “unavoidably unsafe” in 2011 …  Despite package inserts which prove that most vaccines contain known carcinogens and chemicals that cause neurological damage.  Those who dare to question vaccines are EVIL.  They are DANGEROUS!  They must be BLAMED for the deaths of those who are vaccinated.  They must be CENSORED at all costs! (OK, OK, enough sarcasm)  In all seriousness, this information might save someone’s life, so we wanted to share with you. It was provided by a physician who wishes to remain anonymous. The goal of this research is to help the body recover from damage and detoxify, stabilize, and cleanse the toxic ingredients from the body including hydrogels, luciferase, and nanobots as well as silence the messenger RNA (mRNA) contained in the COVID vaccine.  What is mRNA?  Messenger RNA (mRNA) mediates the transfer of genetic information from the cell nucleus to ribosomes in the cytoplasm, where it serves as a template for protein synthesis.  HUH?  I know, this sounds like a bunch of scientific ‘gobbly-gook’ so let me translate for you.  We are made of cells. Each cell contains millions of proteins. The instructions for making proteins are “written” in a cell’s DNA in the form of genes, which build proteins via transcription (“rewriting” the DNA sequence in the form of mRNA) and translation (“decoding” the mRNA and building the protein).  So, if the COVID vaccine uses mRNA to change your genetic code, then the key to preventing damage would logically be to interfere with the translation of the message, right?  Voila!  The RNA Interference system (RNAi) is a mechanism by which cells control gene expression by shutting off translation of mRNA. RNAi can also be used to shut down translation of viral proteins when a cell is infected by a virus. The RNAi system also has the potential to be exploited therapeutically1 and can prevent the viral RNA from replicating.  Below are the TOP FIVE recommended substances to mitigate damage from mRNA vaccines (in no particular order).  1 | IODINE  An essential mineral, iodine is used by the thyroid gland to make thyroid hormones that control many functions in the body including growth and development, repairing damaged cells and supporting a healthy metabolism.  Because your body does not produce iodine, it needs to be supplied in the diet. Iodine can also be used to detoxify toxic compounds and strongly increases the mRNA decay rate.2,3 Dietary iodine also controls its own absorption through regulation of the sodium/iodide (NIS) symporter,4,5 which protects the functions of the thyroid gland.6  2 | ZINC  Zinc enables the body to make proteins and DNA, contributes to wound healing, and plays a role in childhood growth and development. It also has antioxidant properties and plays an important role in cell-mediated immune function and modulates mRNA levels of cytokines.7  Zinc has been shown to regulate gene transcription in cancer cells, plus zinc globally down-regulates microRNA expression and key enzymes and proteins necessary for microRNA maturation and stability.8 Lastly, zinc-finger protein serrate is among the plant compounds that may silence mRNA.9  3 | QUERCETIN  Quercetin, a flavonoid with multiple proven health benefits to both man and animals, displays a plethora of biological activities.  Quercetin-treated neutrophils exhibited a remarkable suppression in mRNA expression of various proinflammatory genes.10  One of the lesser-known and recently discovered roles of quercetin, is modulation of microRNA (miRNA) expression, which plays a vital role in health and disease.11  4 | SUPERCHARGED C60  (Nano-Carbon Activated Charcoal)  Carbon 60 (C60) is a naturally occurring molecule comprised of 60 carbon atoms forming something that looks like a hollow soccer ball. The scientific name for C60 is “Buckminsterfullerene” and it is the only molecule of a single element to form a spherical cage, and it may be the most powerful antioxidant yet known, performing the antioxidant action of Superoxide Dismutase, Glutathione, Catalase, and COQ10.  Over the past 13 years, the “Supercharged” C60 fullerene molecule has been examined, tested and characterized by no less than 15 universities and 5 federally certified research laboratories, resulting in more than “600 evaluations.”  There has also been considerable positive research conducted regarding Supercharged C60 potential uses in electromagnetic field (EMF) absorption. The Supercharged C60 molecule is a nanocarbon material that exhibits incredibly potent antioxidant properties that may augment the body’s ability to manage oxidative stress in both healthy and diseased states.  Studies indicate that carbon nanocarriers can deliver small interfering RNA (siRNA) and enable a myriad of plant biotechnology mRNA applications,12 internalize into cells and subsequent gene silencing efficiency,13 and are critical for efficient gene knockdown.14  5 | PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinine)  Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) is a powerful antioxidant and cellular energy booster that works to support the health of your energy-producing mitochondria, protecting them from oxidative damage, even helping you grow new mitochondria.15 PQQ is actually the only nutrient on earth known to be capable of generating new mitochondria.  PQQ is contained in fruits and vegetables and in human breast milk and is a plant growth factor and bacterial cofactor. Studies have shown that PQQ disodium salt (BioPQQ™) has positive effects on cognitive function and may have a protective effect on UVA irradiation-induced aging.16,17  CONCLUSION  As pressure to be vaccinated for COVID mounts, it will be vital to discover methods to mitigate damage, especially for those who are required to be vaccinated due to employer requirements or other reasons.  In summary, the five substances discussed above are as follows, along with links to recommended sources:  Also, water only fasting (for 1 week) has been shown to repair DNA damage and silence foreign mRNA. And taking full spectrum hemp extract is another excellent suggestion due to the positive effects on our endocannabinoid system, which regulate almost every internal function. We take this organic hemp extract every day!  Interestingly, Merck abandoned development of two COVID vaccines, saying that after extensive research it was concluded that the shots offered less protection than just contracting the virus itself and developing natural antibodies. On January 25th, they announced that the vaccines generated an ‘inferior’ immune system response in comparison with natural infection.18  Recently a CNA nursing home whistleblower went public and shared his experience that seniors are “dying like flies” after taking their COVID-19 jabs.19 Sadly, these seniors are being required to take vaccines for a “virus” that updated CDC analysis shows is actually less dangerous… than living!20",How to Neutralize Potential Damage from mRNA Vaccines,false

You know, one of those “dangerous” and “selfish” people, as the Democrats would call you, who is foolish for not getting the jab because, after all, it’s completely safe?  Well, the CDC has quietly released data that might prove you’re not that foolish after all.  The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) posted data which shows that more people have died after receiving a COVID vaccine than for all other vaccines of the last 20 years combined.  According to the CDC website: “Over 245 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines were administered in the United States from Dec. 14, 2020, through May 3, 2021. During this time, VAERS received 4,178 reports of death (0.0017%) among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine. CDC and FDA physicians review each case report of death as soon as notified and CDC requests medical records to further assess reports.”  A “review of available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records has not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines,” according to their website. This is critical medical editorializing in order to avoid scaring people. The CDC has a vested interest in getting as many people vaccinated as possible, so they buried the crucial data about deaths at the bottom of a page meant to assuage concerns about these experimental drugs with the explicit intent of forcing people to take it.  Of course, vaccine apprehension is nothing new. Tucker Carlson has been raising legitimate concerns for quite a while now.  One of his latest segments on Fox News’ “Tucker Carlson Tonight” Carlson asked a very important question:  “How many Americans have died after taking the COVID vaccines? Not Americans who’ve been killed by the virus, that’s a huge number, but how many Americans have died after getting the vaccines designed to prevent the virus? Do you know the answer to that question? Do you know anything about the downside? We know a lot about the upside of the vaccine. We’ve been completely in favor of vulnerable people taking vaccines.”  Carlson’s segment was, predictably, banned from YouTube for simply questioning vaccine safety. People, however, have been sharing recordings online.  Before Big Tech takes it down again, check out the video below:  On this occasion, full marks to Fox News, but it is obviously an exception.  Carlson makes the point that in 4 months of Covid ""vaccines"", the 3,000+ deaths is greater than with all other vaccines in the previous 15 years. No official investigation!https://t.co/iebMBd30eF — Dr Verner Wheelock (@VernersViews) May 6, 2021  People don’t usually associate vaccines with serious side effects, let alone deaths, because vaccines are, on the whole, not dangerous, at least according to the numbers. Every year, about 160 million Americans get the flu shot, including myself, so I’m clearly not an “anti-vaxxer”. I just have a few questions about the COVID vaccine that I can’t seem to find answers to.  Tucker said, “Every year, a relatively small number of people seem to die after getting those shots. To be precise, in 2019, that number was 203 people. The year before, it was 119. In 2017, a total of 85 people died from the flu shot.”  Out of 160 million people who get the flu shot, those numbers of people who died, every one of them being tragic to their loved ones, aren’t significant enough for the rest of us to consider not getting the flu shot.  Carlson wanted to know how many people have died from getting the COVID vaccine:  “We checked today. Here’s the answer, which comes from the same set of government numbers that we just listed: Between late December of 2020, and last month, a total of 3,362 people apparently died after getting the COVID vaccines in the United States. Three thousand, three hundred and sixty-two — that’s an average of 30 people every day. So, what does that add up to? By the way, that reporting period ended on April 23. We don’t have numbers past that, we’re not quite up to date. But we can assume that another 360 people have died in the 12 days since. That is a total of 3,722 deaths. Almost four thousand people died after getting the COVID vaccines. The actual number is almost certainly much higher than that — perhaps vastly higher.”  Why isn’t anyone talking about this? Do doctors and other medical professionals now understand that you’re not supposed to talk about anything that goes against the Woke Supremacy’s COVID stance?

8,240988184127263059916419185466606679317,"The Delta Covid-19 variant is currently rampant in the United Kingdom according to official data which has been released by Public Health England (PHE) in an attempt to justify the continuation of draconian restrictions on the lives of the British people.  However, we wonder if they realise that the very same data PHE released shows us that people who have received two doses of the Covid-19 vaccine have an 885% higher chance of dying of Covid-19 than of those who are unvaccinated?  The PHE report which can be viewed here shows that between the 1st February 2021 and the 21st June 2021 a total of 92,029 confirmed cases of the Delta variant had been confirmed.  Of these 58.4% were people who had not been vaccinated, totalling 53,822.  A further 7.8% were people who had received both doses of a Covid-19 vaccine, totalling 7,235.  A further 14.9% were people who had received one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine at least three weeks prior to testing positive for the Delta Covid variant, totalling 13,715.  And a further 6.78% were people who had received one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine less than three weeks prior to testing positive for the Delta Covid variant, totalling 6,242.  As per the above table taken from the Public Health England report we can see that the number of positive cases of the Delta variant in people who are unvaccinated outnumber the number of positive cases of the Delta variant in people who are fully vaccinated by around 7.4 to 1.  This difference probably gives you the impression that the Covid-19 jabs are working fantastically? Well don’t get too excited.  Because if we take the number of people who have had at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine – 27,192, we can see that the number of people who are unvaccinated, who have tested positive for the Delta variant only outnumber people who have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine by around 1.97 to 1.  They don’t seem so fantastic now do they?  But how do have these alleged confirmed cases of the alleged Delta Covid-19 variant translated into hospitalisations? Well thankfully Public Health England tell us within their report.  As per the above table we can see that of the 53,822 confirmed cases of the Delta Covid variant in people who were unvaccinated, 831 presented to emergency care which resulted in overnight inpatient admission. This accounts for 1.54% of the confirmed cases in people who are unvaccinated.  However, of the 7,235 confirmed cases of the Delta variant in people who are fully vaccinated people, 190 presented to emergency care which resulted in overnight inpatient admission. This accounts for 2.6% of the confirmed cases in people who are fully vaccinated.  This data, which has been published by Public Health England, shows us that people who have received two doses of a Covid-19 vaccine have a 70.1% higher chance of being hospitalised with the alleged Delta Covid variant than people who are unvaccinated.  None of the Covid-19 vaccines have been proven to prevent infection or prevent the spread of the alleged Covid-19 virus. Instead they have allegedly been proven to reduce the risk of hospitalisation and death, but even then the study carried out is highly questionable.  It doesn’t look like the Covid-19 vaccines are doing what they say on the tin, does it? Perhaps they’re doing their job at reducing the risk of death, thankfully Public Health England have provided the data for us to find out.  As per the above table we can see that of the 53,822 confirmed cases of the Delta Covid variant in people who are unvaccinated, 44 have sadly died. This accounts to 0.07% of confirmed cases in the people who are unvaccinated.  However, of the 7,235 confirmed cases of the Delta Covid variant in people who had received both doses of a Covid-19 vaccine and were therefore fully vaccinated, 50 have sadly died. This accounts to 0.69% of confirmed cases in people who are fully vaccinated.  This data, which again has been published by Public Health England, shows us that people who have received two doses of a Covid-19 vaccine have a 885.7% higher chance of dying due to the Delta Covid variant than people who are unvaccinated.  Now that definitely isn’t what the Covid-19 vaccines said they would do on the tin.  Is this evidence of antibody-dependent enhancement? One senior researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory – Stephanie Seneff, seems to think so.  ADE blighted previous attempts at coronavirus vaccines and frequently resulted in enhanced lung disease among vaccinated lab animals. It led researchers in 2012 to advise scientists to proceed with “caution” for any human coronavirus vaccines which could lead to enhanced lung disease.  Seneff said research has shown that coronavirus vaccines alter the ways immune systems respond to infection and can activate other sleeping infections in the vaccinated person.  “It is conceivable to me that the laser-beam specificity of the induced antibodies is offset by a general weakening of innate immunity,” Seneff said.  “I also suspect that massive vaccination campaigns may accelerate the rate at which the vaccine-resistant mutant strains become dominant among all the SARS-CoV-2 strains.”  Considering the fact 45 million people have had at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine in the United Kingdom at the time of writing, it looks like we’re in for one hell of a winter crisis.",Fully vaccinated people have a 885% higher chance of death due to Covid-19 than people who are unvaccinated according to official data,false
9,212759982338406281914383909445151155412,"(Natural News) Via the words of the CDC’s own director Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the official narrative on vaccines and covid has just self-destructed. While in March of this year, Walenksy had publicly promised that vaccinated people could not spread the virus and infect others, this week she publicly stated that vaccines are failing, and that vaccinated people may now carry higher viral loads than unvaccinated people, contributing to the spread of covid.  Even Yahoo News, which typically shills for Big Pharma, could not sugarcoat the devastating narrative shift, reporting:  The CDC updated its guidelines on Tuesday to recommend masks indoors, even for vaccinated people.  The Delta variant makes it easier for vaccinated people to transmit the virus, the CDC said.  Vaccinated and unvaccinated people infected with Delta may have similar viral loads.  USA Today was so alarmed by the CDC confession that they tried to memory hole their own reporting which cited NBC News. In a panic, USA Today scrubbed this sentence from their story:  NBC News, citing unnamed officials aware of the decision, reported it comes after new data suggests vaccinated individuals could have higher levels of virus and infect others amid the surge of cases driven by the delta variant of the coronavirus.  The CDC is currently hiding these data from the public, by the way, most likely because they know that once the data are revealed, any remaining shred of their pro-vaccine narrative will spontaneously collapse.  CDC “confession” just obliterated all the promises made to the vaccinated… now they are slowly realizing they’re the doomed super-spreaders  In making these public statements, the CDC just admitted that the entire promise that vaccinated people were immune to covid and couldn’t spread it to others just unraveled. Immediately, the CDC demanded that the entire nation revert to neanderthal mask mandates, even for those who have been “fully vaccinated.”  It begs the question: If the answer isn’t vaccines but rather just wearing masks, then why does America need the CDC in the first place? And since masks actually don’t work to block viral particles that are orders of magnitude smaller than the gaps in the mask threads, then how can masks stop them?  And if vaccines aren’t working, then what’s the use of vaccine passports?  This is all an open admission that the CDC has no tools against covid and that the last 18 months of pro-vaccine promises were nothing but lies and propaganda. Even worse, the entire medical establishment has suppressed the only legitimate solution to this pandemic, which is natural immunity, which can only function effectively when combined with good nutrition and proper supplementation. Yet the one-size-fits-all medical cult system that dominates society today can only see pharmaceuticals and vaccines as possible answers, never nutrition or natural immunity. Therefore, the CDC has nothing left to offer America other than blind obedience to their quack science lies.  But it’s even worse: CDC director just admitted the vaccines will soon be obsolete  If you can imagine it, the situation is actually far worse than what’s been covered here so far. In her public confessions this week, CDC director Walensky also admitted that covid is “just a few mutations away” from rendering all existing vaccines completely obsolete. She added:  The largest concern that I think we in public health and science are worried about is that virus and the potential mutations. We have a very transmissible virus, which has the potential to evade our vaccines in terms of how it protects us from severe disease and death…  So then, as any rational person might ask, what is the point of taking vaccines in the first place? This is even more alarming when you realize that vaccine-induced “immunity” is now documented to start fading after six weeks. And once the vaccine fades, people become more vulnerable to infections, compared to the unvaccinated or those with natural immunity. That’s why in California right now, the highest count of new covid-19 cases are being recorded in counties with the highest vaccination rates.  Similarly, in pushing for another moneymaking racket of “booster shots,” vaccine companies are now openly stating that their own vaccines stop working after a few months, hence people will need booster shots to keep the vaccine profits flowing.  Actually, it’s worse still: The vaccinated people are the “super-breeders” of covid variants, too  Not only are vaccinated people now the super-spreaders, it also turns out they’re the “super-breeders” of vaccine variants. As vaccine scientist Geert vanden Bossche explains: (emphasis ours)  …[M]ass vaccination promotes natural selection of increasingly vaccine immunity (VI)-escaping variants in the vaccinated part of the population. Taken together, mass vaccination conducted on a background of high infectivity rates enables more infectious, increasingly VI-escaping variants to expand in prevalence. This evolution inevitably results in inclining morbidity rates in both, the non-vaccinated and vaccinated population and precipitates the emergence of circulating viral variants that will eventually fully resist vaccine-mediated immunity (VMI). This is why mass vaccination campaigns should not be conducted during a pandemic of a highly mutable virus, let alone during a pandemic of more infectious variants (unless transmission-blocking vaccines are used!). It is critical to understand that a rapid decline in viral infectivity rates that is not achieved by natural infection but merely results from expedited mass vaccination campaigns will only delay abrupt propagation of emerging, fully vaccine-resistant viral variants and hence, only delay the occurrence of a high wave of morbidity and mortality.  The “high wave of morbidity and mortality,” it seems, has only just begun.  Dr. Robert Malone warns of “worst case scenario” and cites first evidence showing Antibody Dependent Enhancement (ADE) now emerging  Over the next 12 months or so, we are likely going to see a wave of post-vaccine deaths that mirrors the wave of people obtaining vaccines earlier this year. Even Dr. Robert Malone, inventor of the mRNA vaccine technology, warns that the CDC’s admission is essentially a confirmation that Antibody Dependent Enhancement effects have begun.  In a recent interview with Steve Bannon on War Room Pandemic, Dr. Malone (who is fully pro-vaccine, by the way), stated:  This is exactly what you would see if antibody dependent enhancement were happening… Pfizer protection is waning at six months. Those who received Pfizer, that are now in the waning phase, seem to be getting infected. This exactly what you would anticipate is the window of greatest susceptibility to antibody dependent enhancement, in this long tapering phase as the vaccine response declines.  The government is obfuscating what’s happening here. What seems to be rolling out the worst case scenario where the vaccine in the waning phase is causing virus to replicate more efficiently than it would otherwise, which is what we call ADE.  When one of the world’s leading pro-vaccine scientists — the inventor of mRNA vaccine technology — steps forward and says the covid vaccines now represent a “worst case scenario,” it’s probably worth paying attention.  I cover all this in much more detail in today’s eye-opening Situation Update podcast via Brighteon.com:  Brighteon.com/6657f4c5-a077-4136-b922-242c0236bb83  Find a new podcast (plus amazing interviews with experts) each weekday at:  https://www.brighteon.com/channels/hrreport","CDC confesses: Vaccines are failing, the vaxxed can be super-spreaders, demands return to mask mandates for everyone, including the vaxxed",false
10,105645043441064927518702590597259707996,"On Saturday, September 11, 43-year-old Dale Oliver of Sandy Hook, Kentucky, was engaged in his typical weekend ritual—watching college football on TV—when he heard a knock on his front door. Upon opening it, he found himself face-to-face with two uninvited guests, representatives of Elliott County Health Department. They wished to speak to him about his vaccination status.  “It’s come to our attention your family has not been vaccinated. May we come in?” one health official said, according to Mr. Oliver.  Mr. Oliver lives in a modest home with his wife of 15 years and their 13-year-old daughter, whom they have started homeschooling in response to draconian mask mandates. A hardworking diesel mechanic who puts in 60 hours a week, Mr. Oliver prefers to spend his limited free time at home with his family, free of unwanted intrusions. He told Real Raw News that he self-identifies as a “Trump supporting constitutionalist, conservative” who has serious concerns over the safety and efficacy of the current Covid-19 vaccinations and the current administration’s unconstitutional vaccine mandates.  Elliott County, where he lives, is barely a blip on the map, a heavily Democratic County of 7,500 souls.  “I told them whether or not we’ve taken the shot was none of their damn business and to leave. But they just stood there staring at me like I was some kind of animal or something. I was curious and asked how they hell they’d know if I and my family got jabbed,” Mr. Elliott told RRN.  The county health officers were not schooled in Deep State discretion, apparently.  They told Mr. Oliver that 2020 Census data showed 3 people living in the household, and that information, when compared against the CDCs vaccination database, proved that neither Mr. Oliver nor his wife and daughter had been vaccinated for Covid-19.  Their statements raise grave concern, as the CDC insists it does not maintain a database of vaccination and unvaccinated persons, and claims vaccination records it receives are collected in aggregate, with no personal identifying information. Mr. Oliver’s encounter certainly casts doubt on CDC honesty, and it’s simple to see just how easily the CDC can obtain an individual’s vaccination status.  Typically, people get vaccinated at one of two venues—either a pharmacy or a mass depopulation—vaccination—center. Before getting jabbed, people present proof of identity—insurance cards and/or a photo ID, both of which reveal a home address; most city and county mass vaccination sites across the country require proof of residency to get the jab. Therefore, county health officials can figure out who has and who has not received a vaccination.  The CDC and county health officials have obtained 2020 Census records to enhance their vaccination enforcement protocols. Respondents of the 2020 Census were asked how many people dwell in a household, a question that has appeared on the intrusive, decennial survey since its start in 1902.  “I regret filling that thing out at all,” Mr. Oliver said. “I had no idea it would be used against me. This is criminal.”  Elliott County health officers, Mr. Oliver added, accused him of being an “anti-vaxxer” an endangering the lives of not only his family but also neighbors who had taken Covid-19 vaccinations.  “They told me I’m a health risk to the community, and that if I got anyone sick, I could be charged with crimes. When I told them bastards that I didn’t have time to wait in some damn 12-hour line for a shot, they told me they’d send someone to my house to give us the shot. Fuckers outright said Joe Biden and Dr. Fauci want me to take it, to protect other people from Covid-19. I started to close the door and their ugly faces when they really pissed me off,” Mr. Oliver said.  The Elliott County health officers questioned Mr. Oliver as to why he had unenrolled his daughter from the Elliott County School District and opted instead to homeschool her.  “You’re the only person in the district to pull your daughter out of school. Is there a problem? We can arrange counselling for your family if you think the vaccine is unsafe, and we can send CPS for a wellness check on your daughter—can we speak to her?”  Mr. Oliver said he slammed shut the door.  RRN has viewed door-cam footage corroborating Mr. Oliver’s assertions; however, he has asked that it remain confidential for now, as he has hired a lawyer and intends to sue Elliott County for violating his family’s privacy.  “Somehow, all my neighbors know we’re not vaccinated now, and they’re giving us dirty looks all the time,” Mr. Oliver said.

11,76881083037647311398413427781828202795,"Editor’s Note: This statement corresponds with our 4-hour crowdsourced documentary featuring personal accounts from many soldiers. For further information, watch it here.  We are experiencing the most devastating attack on the U.S. military in history!  An estimated 350,000 of our military service members are being dishonorably discharged for refusing to take a completely unnecessary and experimental mRNA nanotech injection, which is now proven to degrade immune systems and cause many serious side effects.  Committing Total Force to these reckless injections, which do not protect troops from getting COVID, and, in fact, increase the threat of the spread and result in many provable side effects, is the greatest failure of military leadership in our history, at best. At worst, it is a deliberate treasonous attack against the U.S. military by the top of the Chain of Command.  To make matters even worse, an estimated 450,000 service members have recently been injected with the non-FDA approved Pfizer shot, even though many were falsely led to believe that they were getting the FDA-approved version, which is not even available in the U.S..  The outright lies, confusion and shocking lack of knowledge and incompetence demonstrated over the past week throughout the Chain of Command, which is covered in our 4-hour video here, is a low point in U.S. military history.  As you are reading this, many of these coerced troops are now beginning to experience side effects and COVID infection rates are increasing throughout the force. Many pilots are now grounded because of high risks of blood clots and heart failure while flying.  An estimated 400,000 military service members did not want the nanotech injections but submitted to taking them because they couldn’t afford to live without pay, benefits and the devastating scarlet letter of a dishonorable discharge.  A dishonorable discharge has severe ramifications when it comes to being employed throughout the civilian workforce. It is essentially sentencing many of our troops to a life of low-wage work and poverty in the draconian mandate economy, which also now demands injections for many jobs, with all the severe economic sanctions under the guise of “public health” that they will now face in civilian life.  Based on our assessments, it is now clear the Global Private Military Complex has captured the top of the U.S. military Chain of Command and is systematically degrading the U.S. military as part of a worldwide strategy to weaken national civilian militaries.  Our military is their greatest adversary and primary target.  Make no mistake, to dishonorably discharge thousands of our most elite fighting forces is a blatant Act of War against the American people.  The all-out systemic attacks against the American people are Acts of War.  There are so many outrageously corrupt activities and systemic abuses presently happening under the guise of “public health” throughout the government that it is now very obvious that the American people do not have any effective representation on the federal level.  The dishonorable discharge policy also makes it likely that many of our most elite fighting forces will now be inclined to take jobs as mercenaries in the Global Private Military Complex to support their young families – how convenient.  The American people are now up against the same imperial playbook of policies that have been strategically deployed to destabilize the Middle East, Latin America and many other nations worldwide. Now, the globalist “War on Terror” is targeting first world populations. This “mandate” attack against our military, police, doctors, nurses and other critical sectors is tactical destabilization 101.  Bottom line, there are significant numbers of people throughout the Intelligence Community, military, and Special Forces in particular, who know Rome has fallen.  The “New World Order” terrorists attacking humanity have become absurdly arrogant. We are experiencing the imperial overreach that occurs when an endangered oligarchy’s power structure collapses.  The compromised Biden Administration has also launched an attack against all U.S. veterans who do not submit to nanotech injections. As of November 1, all non-injected veterans will be denied V.A. healthcare – another Act of War to add to the long list of abuses.  There is also a new “Red Flag” gun law that targets veterans and newly discharged troops. If anyone reports them for vague and minor suspensions, they will have their guns taken away from them.  The Biden Administration is even trying to call in the United Nations’ Blue Helmet troops to be deployed throughout the U.S. to enforce international gun control and undermine our 2nd Amendment rights.  Everything that has happened over the past week is all coming right after a “deliberately botched” Afghanistan withdrawal, which was strategically designed to destroy troop morale and create division throughout the ranks.  In fact, Lt. Col. Stuart Sheller, who has been fighting this war for 17 years and is the highest ranking Marine to publicly speak out -- after 13 of his fellow troops were unnecessarily killed -- and demanded accountability from the top of the Chain of Command, is now a political prisoner in pre-trial brig solitary for an indefinite period of time, while no charges have even been filed against him.  Crimes Against Humanity  All of this is happening as more than 7,800 doctors and scientists have signed a “Physicians Declaration” condemning policymakers for “authoritarian” strategies that have resulted in “needless illness and death,” which amount to “Crimes Against Humanity.”  As we covered in our video, official COVID policies have led to over 500,000 unnecessary civilian deaths throughout the United States. The systemic shutdown of well-proven life-saving, safe and effective treatments, in favor of now well-proven harmful treatments, is blatant systemic medical malpractice.  Based on our assessments, it is clear that COVID is a bio-weapon that has been strategically released, and the spike protein and other ingredients in the mRNA nanotech injections are weaponized.  We also know that lockdowns have done significantly more harm than good, and now, with all these new mandates, our doctors, nurses and millions of essential workers throughout every sector of the economy are losing their jobs.  We are witnessing the deliberate incremental systematic dismantling and destruction of our country. The Global Private Military Complex is tactically turning America into Afghanistan and Iraq.  The amount of military movement throughout and around the continental U.S. is highly alarming. The designation and building of “internment facilities” under the guise of “public health,” and the fortification of Walmarts across the country, is also concerning.  The shocking complete opening of our entire Southern border by the Biden Administration is another new major National Security threat. We have credible intelligence that terrorists, drug cartels and global intel-backed mercenaries have entered the country and are being strategically deployed throughout the United States.  They are primarily targeting critical infrastructure and essential services, supply lines and states that are not enforcing “injection” mandates.  We are also deeply concerned about all the cargo ships that are now overwhelming all of our ports. Our supply lines of essential goods are being strategically disrupted and these ships and their unknown cargo represent an urgent critical National Security threat.  As we covered in our video, weapons systems, missiles and drones are suspected to be in some of these cargo ships. The military must immediately inspect and process every container.  We have a wide-open Southern border and we are surrounded by hundreds of cargo ships. In totality, it is a complete shitshow of systemic breakdown, corruption, incompetence and arrogance, and all this is happening right after the botched Afghanistan exit, which killed 13 troops and left behind $85 billion in weapons - and now we are discharging hundreds of thousands of troops while hundreds of thousands are now injected with a weaponized “vaccine.”  Clearly, Rome has fallen and rogue forces have compromised the Chain of Command.  The American people are under attack.  The Constitution is under attack.  We are under attack!  Therefore, we are now forced to engage tactical operations to save our nation and our families. We want to maintain peace while being surgical in detaining the terrorists.  Detain The Terrorists: Fauci, Gates, Schwab & Fink  As we highlighted in our video, the two most publicly known terrorists responsible for these systemic Crimes Against Humanity and Acts of War against the American people, and humanity in general, are Anthony Fauci and Bill Gates.  In addition, Klaus Schwab and Larry Fink have been key strategic driving forces behind overall systemic attacks against us.  ""Markets like totalitarian governments."" “Democracies are very messy, as we know in the United States.” “China has done a magnificent job of engineering their economy.” ~ The Shadow King of Wall Street, Larry Fink, Black Rock CEO, Czar of the Lockdown Economy  We are calling for the immediate detainment and prosecution of those four War Criminals.  Failure to do so, will result in a complete loss of faith in the Intelligence Community and the top of the military Chain of the Command.  We are also calling upon DoD and Intelligence Community Inspector Generals to immediately deploy large-scale wide-ranging investigations into corrupt policy decision-making processes and to conduct a forensic analysis of every move that every agency has made.  If the Office of the Inspector General does not move with immediate overwhelming force, their failure to act will result in a complete loss of faith in our systemic accountability mechanisms.  We want peace and Continuity of Government based on TRANSPARENT processes.  We have a duty and responsibility to protect our nation and our families from these barbaric and vicious systemic attacks.  We know that the Global Private Military is strategically attacking and systematically dismantling the United States and trying to incite division, desperation, confusion and chaos throughout the civilian population.  As the fog of war gets thicker than ever, we will do everything that we can to keep the peace and be a source of stability and critical information throughout the populace.  We are calling upon the American people to unite with their local Sheriff, police and community members to urgently begin full-scale preparations to protect their families.  We believe that the Global Private Military is going to launch terror attacks throughout the U.S. as they increase their asymmetric unconventional warfare against us.  We need to do everything in our power to prevent violent outbreaks.  The Global Private Military wants chaos and violence to erupt throughout our country - that’s why they have been proactively systemically undermining our ability to obtain basic necessities and dismantling critical infrastructure and dismissing hundreds of thousands of police, military, healthcare and essential workforces via non-scientific and non-sensical mandates.  They are deploying the same divide and conquer tactics that they have used to destabilize the Middle East; to get us to fight amongst each other and provoke a civil war. They are using their mainstream media companies to exacerbate confusion and division.  Whether it is inciting the vaccinated vs the unvaccinated or identity politics, it is driven by psychological operations (PSYOP) strategies. Identity politics are strategically designed to silo civilian populations off into the smallest possible demographics so they fight amongst each other while imperial forces take over.  Therefore, we need to unite, keep the peace and be surgical in our counter-offensives.  Let it be known to all who perpetrate attacks against the American people that the overwhelming majority of our Special Operations Forces, combat troops and a standing decentralized militia of over 40 million U.S. veterans and well-armed combat-ready civilians are now prepared to defend this country.  The unconventional warfare tactics deployed against us through COVID policies must come to an end now.  Know Your Primary Enemies  China and Russia are playing a role in this war against us. However, it must be known that the Global Private Military is trying to use China, Russia and other nation state adversaries as proxies for their interests.  The World Economic Forum, Business Roundtable, Black Rock, Vanguard and the most powerful global corporations have used and abused China and its people as a vassal state for low-wage sweatshop labor for decades. What they have done to the people of China they now want to do to the people of the United States.  In fact, the Chinese government recently officially declared billionaire George Soros as a “global terrorist.” Saying that he is, “the son of Satan” and “the most evil person in the world.”  We are calling upon the people of China and Russia to join us in this fight against our common enemy. The most powerful global imperial interests have been exploiting and abusing all of us. Now they are trying to get us to go to war with each other so they can enforce a tyrannical fascist New World Order.  It is absolutely critical to understand that the war against freedom and humanity is not a battle between nation states. The Global Private Military has no loyalty to any one nation state - the worldwide release of a bio-weapon and systemic oppression of all nations via draconian lockdown policies and mandates should now make that clear to everyone.  In many ways, COVID is the newest front in the 20-year old imperial power grab known as the “War on Terror.” Global imperial powers have brutally dominated the third and developing world for many decades. With COVID, the fascist imperial seed has now blossomed, and they are now targeting first world populations.  Bottom line, if we are going to survive all of these ongoing attacks against us, we have to be surgical in our counter-offenses and we must be laser-focused on the heads of the snake.  It is our goal to have them detained and legally prosecuted for Crimes Against Humanity - that’s why we are demanding the immediate detainment of Anthony Fauci, Bill Gates, Klaus Schwab and Larry Fink as a first step in restoring faith in our government.  We all have a duty and responsibility to protect the Constitution of the United States against all enemies.  Let it be clearly understood: any government official who continues to be derelict in this duty is committing treason and is an accomplice in a war against the American people.  As the U.S. Supreme Court has made clear, it is up to you, the individual, to disobey unlawful, unconstitutional orders. You cannot legally defend yourself by saying you were just following orders.  It is now time for you to boldly stand up in defense of the American people.  The line is drawn.  What side of history will you be on?

12,267790766862268510261788753813859451354,"What this study finds is exactly what vaccine developer Geert Vanden Bossche (Belgium) has been predicting. The predominance of antibody-resistant SARS-CoV-2 variants in vaccine breakthrough cases from the San Francisco Bay Area, California. [DATA LINK HERE]    The California study finds that vaccinated individuals are more susceptible to COVID variant infections than unvaccinated. Geer Vanden Bossche has been warning that vaccine antibodies would suppress natural antibody responses. The vaccine antibodies take control of the immune system and defend only against a targeted virus.  Among vaccinated individuals, a COVID variant virus is not recognized by the specialized antibodies provided by the vaccine, and the natural antibodies have been programmed to stand down.  (MedRxiv) Associations between vaccine breakthrough cases and infection by SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants have remained largely unexplored. Here we analyzed SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequences and viral loads from 1,373 persons with COVID-19 from the San Francisco Bay Area from February 1 to June 30, 2021, of which 125 (9.1%) were vaccine breakthrough infections. Fully vaccinated were more likely than unvaccinated persons to be infected by variants carrying mutations associated with decreased antibody neutralization.  […] These findings suggest that vaccine breakthrough cases are preferentially caused by circulating antibody-resistant SARS-CoV-2 variants, and that symptomatic breakthrough infections may potentially transmit COVID-19 as efficiently as unvaccinated infections. (read more)  Be careful around vaccinated people, because they can carry a more resistant form of COVID-19. Additionally, the highly specialized antibodies in the vaccine create a need for a booster for each antibody resistant variant. Israel is already on booster #2.  Dr. Vanden Bossche has been using Israeli data and showing how the widespread vaccination rates were creating pressure on the virus to mutate into variants with higher levels of contagion. The unvaccinated group has been keeping the pressure down by defeating the virus and carrying natural immunity. However, as the unvaccinated population is increasingly made smaller, the pressure on the virus to mutate increases. Subsequently, these mutations stay at higher or more effective levels of infection.  Israel is already on its second round of booster shots.  The long term impacts of antibody dependency are unknown. Some doctors and scientists are already worried that normal cancer fighting antibodies will become dormant and we could see an explosion of unusual cancer clusters due to antibody suppression caused by the COVID vaccines. [Diminished natural killer cells]  Remember, no one knows exactly what this targeted vaccine will do to the overall human immune system as it responds to other viruses or infections. The vaccinated population are the human trial subjects, and the unvaccinated population are the control group.  In the U.K. data study there were:  157,400 Delta variant cases amid the fully vaccinated (26.52% of total cases), and 257,357 Delta variant cases amid the unvaccinated (43.36% of total cases). However, when it came to severe outcomes 63.5% of deaths were from the fully vaccinated group.

14,43676147105425797478940064230863031145,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s announcement Monday that it had granted “full approval” to the Covid shots being offered by Pfizer is riddled with deceptions meant to trick the American public into thinking they have no choice but to take the jab while at the same time protecting a major pharmaceutical company from legal liability.  What was actually given full approval was a separate Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine product which goes by the name Comirnaty.  But Comirnaty is not even currently available in the U.S.  This is part of a cynical plot to protect Pfizer from broad legal liability and also to snooker U.S. employers into mandating the vaccine for their employees.  Watch Dr. Robert Malone, inventer of the mRNA technology on which the Covid vaccines are based, explain the chicanery the FDA is using to fool the American people.  The FDA on Monday approved a biologics license application for the Pfizer Comirnaty vaccine. The Biden White House, with cover from its corporate media shills, immediately reported that vaccine mandates are now legal for military, healthcare workers, college students and employees of just about any business.  But as Children’s Health Defense reports, “there are several bizarre aspects to the FDA approval that will prove confusing to those not familiar with the pervasiveness of the FDA’s regulatory capture, or the depths of the agency’s cynicism.”  The FDA acknowledges that while Pfizer has insufficient supplies of the newly licensed Comirnaty vaccine actually available, there is “a significant amount” of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID vaccine — which has been produced under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) and will continue to be offered under the same EUA status, CHD reports.  The FDA in its convoluted letter of approval for the Pfizer vaccine under the EUA should remain unlicensed but can be used “interchangeably” (page 2, footnote 8) with the newly licensed Comirnaty product [which is currently unavailable].  According to the FDA, the newly licensed Pfizer Comirnaty vaccine and the existing vaccine, while “legally distinct,” are not any different in terms of their “safety or effectiveness.”  Here is the pertinent quote from footnote 8 that proves we are talking about two separate shots and not just a “rebranding” of the same shot as the mainstream media is reporting:  “The licensed vaccine has the same formulation as the EUA-authorized vaccine and the products can be used interchangeably to provide the vaccination series without presenting any safety or effectiveness concerns. The products are legally distinct with certain differences that do not impact safety or effectiveness.”  The “certain differences” are not specified, but it is perfectly clear that the two jabs are legally distinct.  The below analysis by Children’s Health Defense explains the trickery in which the FDA has engaged — all for the legal benefit of the Big Pharma giant Pfizer and the detriment of American citizens.  There is a huge real-world difference between products under an EUA compared with those that FDA has fully licensed. EUA products are experimental under U.S law.  Both the Nuremberg Code and Federal Regulations provide that no one can force a human being to participate in this experiment. Under 21 U.S. Code Sec.360bbb-3(e)(1)(A)(ii)(III), “authorization for medical products for use in emergencies,” it is unlawful to deny someone a job or an education because they refuse to be an experimental subject. Instead, potential recipients have an absolute right to refuse EUA vaccines.  U.S. laws, however, permit employers and schools to require students and workers to take licensed vaccines.  EUA-licensed vaccines have an extraordinary liability shield under the 2005 Public Readiness and Preparedness Act. Vaccine manufacturers, distributors, providers and government planners are immune from liability. The only way an injured party can sue is if he or she can prove willful misconduct, and if the U.S. government has also brought an enforcement action against the party for willful misconduct. No such lawsuit has ever succeeded.  The government has created an extremely stingy compensation program, the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program, to redress injuries from all EUA products.  The program’s parsimonious administrators have compensated under 4% of petitioners to date — and not a single COVID vaccine injury — despite the fact that physicians, families and injured vaccine recipients have reported more than 600,000 COVID vaccine injuries.  At least for the moment, the Pfizer Comirnaty vaccine has no liability shield. Vials of the branded product, which say “Comirnaty” on the label, are subject to the same product liability laws as other U.S. products.  When the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices places a vaccine on the mandatory schedule, a childhood vaccine benefits from an generous retinue of liability protections.  But licensed adult vaccines, including the new Comirnaty, do not enjoy any liability shield. Just as with Ford’s exploding Pinto, or Monsanto’s herbicide Roundup, people injured by the Comirnaty vaccine could potentially sue for damages.  And because adults injured by the vaccine will be able to show that the manufacturer knew of the problems with the product, jury awards could be astronomical.  Pfizer is therefore unlikely to allow any American to take a Comirnaty vaccine until it can somehow arrange immunity for this product.  Given this background, the FDA’s acknowledgement in its approval letter that there are insufficient stocks of the licensed Comirnaty, but an abundant supply of the EUA Pfizer BioNTech jab, exposes the “approval” as a cynical scheme to encourage businesses and schools to impose illegal jab mandates.  The FDA’s clear motivation is to enable Pfizer to quickly unload inventories of a vaccine that science and the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System have exposed as unreasonably dangerous, and that the Delta variant has rendered obsolete.  Americans, told that the Pfizer COVID vaccine is now licensed, will understandably assume that COVID vaccine mandates are lawful. But only EUA-authorized vaccines, for which no one has any real liability, will be available during the next few weeks when many school mandate deadlines occur.  The FDA appears to be purposefully tricking American citizens into giving up their right to refuse an experimental product.  While the media has trumpeted that the FDA has approved COVID vaccines, the FDA has not approved the Pfizer BioNTech vaccines, nor any COVID vaccines for the 12- to 15-year age group, nor any booster doses for anyone.  And FDA has not licensed any Moderna vaccine, nor any vaccine from Johnson & Johnson — so the vast majority of vaccines available in the U.S., if not all, remain unlicensed EUA products.  Here’s what you need to know when somebody orders you to get the vaccine:; Ask to see the vial. If it says “Comirnaty,” it’s a licensed product. If it says “Pfizer-BioNTech,” it’s an experimental product, and under 21 U.S. Code 360bbb, you have the right to refuse.  If it comes from Moderna or Johnson & Johnson (marketed as Janssen), you have the right to refuse.  The FDA is playing bait and switch with the American public — but we don’t have to play along. If it doesn’t say Comirnaty, you have not been offered an approved vaccine.

15,43575447604673646481094151930617813921,"A shocking new study that was conducted by researchers at Canada’s University of Ottawa Heart Institute found that one out of every thousand(1/1000) mRNA Covid-19 vaccinations causes heart inflammation(myopericarditis) to develop rapidly in otherwise healthy individuals.  The study looked at over 32,000 individuals who had received either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines and monitored them for heart-related conditions between June 1, 2021, and July 31, 2021.  32 of the study subjects were admitted into the hospital with heart and chest-related symptoms.  “There were 15,997 doses of Moderna vaccine, and 16,382 doses of Pfizer vaccine administered over the study period, for a total of 32,379 doses. Note that these numbers represent a mixture of first and second doses. TRENDING: ""I Went There for You My Son"" - J6 Political Prisoner Chris Quaglin Was Brutally Beaten in Jail and Denied Celiac-Safe Food - Here Is His Heartfelt Letter to His Son on His First Birthday -- Please Donate Therefore, if our cohort captured all cases in the Ottawa area, then the incidence of myocarditis would be 0.1% of all vaccine doses (32 cases/32,379 doses x 100), or 10 cases of myocarditis for every 10,000 doses of vaccine.”  Researchers found that the symptoms show up extremely quickly after vaccination, usually after the patient’s second dose. On average, people who were affected developed the condition after just 1.5 days.  They also found that men are at a much greater risk than women – only 2 women experienced heart inflammation.  “32 patients were identified over the period of interest. Eighteen patients were diagnosed with myocarditis; 12 with myopericarditis; and 2 with pericarditis alone. The median age was 33 years (18-65 years). The sex ratio was 2 females to 29 males. In 5 cases, symptoms developed after only a single dose of mRNA vaccine. In 27 patients, symptoms developed after their second dose of. Median time between vaccine dose and symptoms was 1.5 days (1-26 days).”  People who took the Moderna jab were 3x more likely to develop symptoms than those who took the Pfizer shot.  To date, this has been the largest case study that has looked at the correlation between Covid mRNA vaccines and myocarditis symptoms within a month of vaccination.  If the results are true, it would actually be more of a risk for anyone under 65 to receive the shot than it would be to contract the virus and recover, especially depending on how young they are. Myocarditis and pericarditis both come with an extremely poor prognosis and end up killing over 50% within 3-10 years of their diagnosis.  According to the most recent data, Americans under 65 have about a 1 in 1863 (Population – 273,820,000 / Total Covid deaths – 146,991) or .00054 chance of dying from Covid-19 or .054%. If you lower the age to 50 and under, the chance that Covid is fatal drops precipitously to .00017 or 1 in 5841 or .o17%.  In other words, the chances that covid will kill you if you are under 50 are almost 6x lower than the chances you will develop a debilitating (and often fatal in the long run) heart condition.  Even more shocking – people under 40 who take the jab are almost 13.5 times more likely to develop some form of myocarditis or pericarditis than to be killed by Covid. Keep in mind the median age from this study was 33.  Meanwhile, Joe Biden and the tyrannical health regime double down on their goal to get “every American” vaccinated by cramming down a new dictatorial federal mandate with a third experimental ‘booster’ jab being prepared for a massive rollout.  The Covid-19 vaccine has been so ‘effective’ in ‘protecting’ people that the masses will now be pressured into taking another dose as new outbreaks of the virus have forced a new wave of authoritarian restrictions.  Every single American has known for months where to go and how to get a vaccine if they wanted one. In fact, over 181 million eligible citizens have been fully vaccinated in the US – If the virus was as deadly as they are making it out to be, they wouldn’t have to mandate people to take the vaccine; and on the other end, if the vaccines provided the protection they’re supposed to provide, the vaccinated wouldn’t be calling people killers because they are refusing to ‘protect others.’  Besides, according to available data, a third of the entire US population had contracted Covid BY THE END OF 2020. Natural immunity has always proven to be superior to vaccines.  A recent study that was conducted in Israel on 800,000 individuals confirms that is especially the case with the rushed mRNA Covid vaccines.  They found that individuals who had received both doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine were 13x more likely to contract Covid-19 than those who had natural immunity – Fully vaccinated people were also found to be at a “GREATER RISK OF HOSPITALIZATION.”  If 1/3rd of Americans had already contracted the virus – before it had even been known for a full year – then why would “everyone” be forced to take the experimental vaccine?

The pregnant Tyrannosaurus Rex’s DNA, that was preserved in “extremely good condition” according to experts, was introduced into the skin cells of a chicken, a modern relative to the Tyrannosaurus Rex.  “We often think of the T-Rex as this huge crocodile-like bipedal reptile but in fact, its closest modern relative are birds and the T-Rex was actually the dinosaur equivalent of a chicken” explains Linda Rushmore, head researcher at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences’ Paleontology Research Lab.  “ The T-Rex was actually the dinosaur equivalent of a chicken “ – Linda Rushmore, Paleontologist  “The similarity of both DNA’s actually surprised us at first and we are extremely enthustiac about the positive results and growth of the embryo,” she adds.  A chicken-dinosaur hybrid  The living embryo is not a 100% dinosaur, but instead a genetically modified hybrid between a Tyrannosaurus Rex and a chicken, explains Helmut Hans Fraser, a molecular biologist at North Carolina State University.  “It is impossible to recreate a fully living dinosaur from these limited samples of DNA, but we have successfully introduced this DNA into living chicken skin cells, so the results of this embryo, if it comes to terms and eventually survives its own birth and does not present any biological defects, will be a total surprise. We have no idea what to expect at all,” explains the assistant research professor of molecular biology sciences. “We have noticed that the embryo grows at abnormal rates for a common chicken embryo. It is presently sixty five times bigger than the size of an average chicken embryo only after three days, but its growth seems exponential, which is clearly fascinating” he admits, visibly enthused by the discovery.  An ethical debate  Although many scientists have perceived the news as a positive advancement for science, some experts believe the experiment is “unethical and possibly dangerous”.  “Who would want, in his right mind, to bring back to life a 4-meter high creature weighing approximately 8 tons?” asks French bioethicist, Jacques Clement, at the University of Versailles in Paris. “There is already a leading consensus that GMO foods can cause damage to human DNA, and now we are creating a Frankenstein-like creature from dinosaur DNA?

The Democrat Party in the Great Commonwealth of Virginia are working hard to take away your 2nd Amendment rights. This is just the beginning. Don’t let it happen, VOTE REPUBLICAN in 2020! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 20, 2020  The president also tweeted about the rally last week, warning people that voting for Democrats would result in their guns being taken away.  Earlier this month, more than 400 people showed up to a meeting in Buckingham County to voice fears that the government would take away their guns following the introduction of a bill to ban assault rifles. That bill was struck down by the state Senate Judiciary Committee last week.  Counties throughout the U.S., including in Virginia, are declaring themselves “Second Amendment sanctuaries,” a cynical play on the term used to describe cities that vow to protect undocumented immigrants by refusing to cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The new gun “sanctuaries” are in response to a cultish, paranoid belief that the government is actively attempting to disarm law-abiding citizens. But the declaration amounts to little more than a symbolic stance. Gun laws are still enforced.  By early afternoon, militia groups that had donned full camouflage and assault rifles began to disperse. The president tweeted he would “NEVER allow our great Second Amendment to go unprotected, not even a little bit!”  But the day of uninterrupted outrage from those carrying military-style murder weapons only highlights that there is no government boogeyman trying to forcefully take Americans’ guns, no matter how much they might try to pretend otherwise.

Here are highlights from the debate, here are The Fix’s winners and losers, and below is the full transcript of the debate.  NBC ANCHOR SAVANNAH GUTHRIE: So, with that business taken care of, let’s get to it. And we’re going to start today with Senator Sanders. Good evening to you.  You've called for big, new government benefits, like universal health care and free college. In a recent interview, you said you suspected that Americans would be, quote, “delighted” to pay more taxes for things like that. My question to you is, will taxes go up for the middle class in a Sanders administration? And if so, how do you sell that to voters?  SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT.): Well, you’re quite right. We have a new vision for America. And at a time when we have three people in this country owning more wealth than the bottom half of America, while 500,000 people are sleeping out on the streets today, we think it is time for change, real change.  Advertisement  And by that, I mean that health care in my view is a human right. And we have got to pass a Medicare-for-all, single-payer system.  (APPLAUSE)  Under that system, by the way, vast majority of the people in this country will be paying significantly less for health care than they are right now.  I believe that education is the future for this country. And that is why I believe that we must make public colleges and universities tuition-free and eliminate student debt. And we do that by placing a tax on Wall Street.  (APPLAUSE)  Every proposal that I have brought forth is fully paid for.  GUTHRIE: Senator Sanders, I’ll give you 10 seconds just to ask the — answer the very direct question. Will you raise taxes for the middle class in a Sanders administration?  SANDERS: People who have health care under Medicare-for-all will have no premiums, no deductibles, no co-payments, no out-of-pocket expenses. Yes, they will pay more in taxes, but less in health care for what they get.  Advertisement  (APPLAUSE)  GUTHRIE: Thank you, Senator.  (CROSSTALK)  GUTHRIE: Senator Bennet, we’re going to get to everybody, I promise.  SEN. MICHAEL F. BENNET (D-COLO.): No, I’d like to say something.  GUTHRIE: But let me just — Senator Biden — promise everybody's going to get in here, promise. Vice President Biden, Senator Sanders, as you know, has been calling for a revolution. Recently in remarks to a group of wealthy donors, as you were speaking about problem of income inequality in this country, you said we shouldn't, quote, “demonize the rich.” You said, “Nobody has to be punished. No one's standard of living would change. Nothing would fundamentally change.” What did you mean by that?  FORMER VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: What I meant by that is, look, Donald Trump thinks Wall Street built America.  Ordinary, middle-class Americans built America. My dad used to have an expression. He said, Joe, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's being able to look your kid in the eye and say everything is going to be okay.  Advertisement  Too many people who are at the middle class and poor have had the bottom fall out under this proposal. What I’m saying is that we’ve got to be straightforward. We have to make sure we understand that to return dignity to the middle class, they have to have insurance that is covered and they can afford it. They have to make sure that we have a situation where there’s continuing education and they’re able to pay for it. And they have to make sure that they’re able to breathe air that is clean and they have water that they can drink.  Look, Donald Trump has put us in a horrible situation. We do have enormous income inequality. And the one thing I agree on is we can make massive cuts in the $1.6 trillion in tax loopholes out there, and I would be going about eliminating Donald Trump’s tax cut for the wealthy.  GUTHRIE: Vice President Biden, thank you. Senator Harris . ..  Advertisement  (APPLAUSE)  There's is a lot of talk in this primary about new government benefits, such as student loan cancellation, free college, health care, and more. Do you think that Democrats have a responsibility to explain how they will pay for every proposal they make along those lines?  SEN. KAMALA D. HARRIS (D-CALIF.): Well, let me tell you something. I hear that question, but where was that question when the Republicans and Donald Trump passed a tax bill that benefits the top 1 percent and the biggest corporations in this country?  (APPLAUSE)  Contributing at least $1 trillion to the debt of America, which middle-class families will pay for one way or another.  Working families need support and need to be lifted up. And frankly, this economy is not working for working people. For too long, the rules have been written in the favor of the people who have the most and not in favor of the people who work the most, which I why I am proposing that we change the tax code, so for every family that is making less than $100,000 a year, they will receive a tax credit that they can collect up to $500 a month, which will make all the difference between those families being able to get through the end of the month with dignity and with support or not.  Advertisement  And on day one, I will repeal that tax bill that benefits the top 1 percent and the biggest corporations of America.  (APPLAUSE)  GUTHRIE: Senator Harris, thank you.  Governor Hickenlooper, let me get you in on this. You’ve warned that Democrats will lose in 2020 if they “embrace socialism,” as you put it. You were booed at the California Democratic convention when you said that. Only one candidate on this stage, Senator Sanders, identifies himself as a democratic socialist. What are the policies or positions of your opponents that you think are veering towards “socialism”?  JOHN HICKENLOOPER: Well, I think that the bottom line is, if we don’t clearly define that we are not socialists, the Republicans are going to come at us every way they can and call us socialists.  And if you look at the Green New Deal, which I admire the sense of urgency and how important it is to do climate change — I'm a scientist — but we can't promise every American a government job. If we want to get universal health care coverage, I believe that health care is a right and not a privilege, but you can't expect to eliminate private insurance for 180 million people, many of whom don't want to give it up.  Advertisement  In Colorado, we brought businesses and nonprofits together, and we got near universal health care coverage. We were the first state in America to bring the environmental community and the oil and gas industry to address — aggressively address methane emissions. And we were also the first place to expand reproductive rights on a scale basis, and we reduced teen pregnancy by 54 percent.  We’ve done the big progressive things that people said couldn’t be done. I’ve done what pretty much everyone else up here is still talking about doing.  GUTHRIE: Governor, thank you.  Senator Sanders, I'll give you a chance to . ..  (APPLAUSE)  . . . to weigh in here. What is your response to those who say nominating a “socialist” would reelect Donald Trump?  SANDERS: Well, I think the responses that the polls — last poll I saw had us 10 points ahead of Donald Trump because the American people understand that Trump is a phony, that Trump is a pathological liar and a racist, and that he lied to the American people during his campaign.  Advertisement  He said he was going to stand up for working families. Well, President Trump, you're not standing up for working families when you try to throw 32 million people off their health care that they have and that 83 percent of your tax benefits go to the top 1 percent. That's how we beat Trump: We expose him for the fraud that he is.  (APPLAUSE)  (CROSSTALK)  GUTHRIE: Senator Gillibrand, 30 seconds.  SEN. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND (D-N.Y.): I disagree with both their perspectives. The debate we’re having in our party right now is confusing, because the truth is there’s a big difference between capitalism on the one hand and greed on the other. And so all the things that we’re trying to change is when companies care more about profits when they do about people.  So if you're talking about ending gun violence, it's the greed of the NRA and the gun manufacturers that make any progress impossible. It's the greed of the insurance companies and the drug companies, when we want to try to get health care as a right and not a privilege.  Advertisement  GUTHRIE: Senator Gillibrand . ..  (CROSSTALK)  GILLIBRAND: So there need not be disagreement in the party because, in truth, we want healthy capitalism.  GUTHRIE: Senator, thank you.  GILLIBRAND: We don't want corrupted capitalism.  GUTHRIE: Thank you. I want to be fair to all the candidates. Thank you.  (APPLAUSE)  Senator Bennet, you have said, quote, “It’s possible to write policy proposals that have no basis in reality. You might as well call them candy. Were you referring to any candidate or proposal in particular when you said that?  BENNET: Was that directed to me?  GUTHRIE: Yes, that was your quote.  BENNET: That sounded like me. Thank you.  (LAUGHTER)  GUTHRIE: It was you.  BENNET: I appreciate it. Well, look, first of all, I agree completely with Bernie about what the fundamental challenge we're facing as a country is, 40 years of no economic growth for 90 percent of the American people; 160,000 families in the top .1 percent have the same wealth as the bottom 90 percent; and we've got the worst income inequality that we've had in 100 years.  Where I disagree is on his solution of Medicare-for-all. You know, I — I have proposed getting to universal health care, which we need to do. It is a right. Health care is a right. We need to get to universal health care. I believe the way to do that is by finishing the work we started with Obamacare and creating a public option that every family and every person in America can make a choice for their family about whether they want a public option, which for them would be like having Medicare-for-all, or whether they want to keep their private insurance.  I believe we will get there much more quickly if we do that.  GUTHRIE: But wait . ..  BENNET: Bernie . ..  (CROSSTALK)  Bernie — if I could just finish, Bernie mentioned that — the taxes that we would have to pay. Because of those taxes, Vermont rejected Medicare-for-all.  GUTHRIE: Senator . ..  SANDERS: Hold on.  (CROSSTALK)  GILLIBRAND: In Bernie's bill — in Bernie's bill, I wrote . ..  GUTHRIE: Senator, please, we are going to talk about health care at length, Senator, but for the moment, my colleague . ..  (UNKNOWN): Thank you very much.  GUTHRIE: . . . wants to continue the questions on the economy.  GILLIBRAND: I wrote the part in Senator Sanders' bill — I wrote the part in Senator Sanders' bill that is the transition, which merges what the two senators said.  (UNKNOWN): Senator . ..  GILLIBRAND: Because the truth is, if you have a buy-in, over a four or five-year period, you move us to single-payer more quickly.  DIAZ-BALART: Senator, we will get to this.  (APPLAUSE)  We will get to this.  SANDERS (?): I just . ..  DIAZ-BALART: Before we do, I want to say hello and good evening, Buenas Noches, to Mayor Pete Buttigieg.  MAYOR PETE BUTTIGIEG: Buenas Noches. Gracias (UNTRANSLATED).  DIAZ-BALART: (UNTRANSLATED).  Many of your colleagues onstage support free college. You do not. Why not?  BUTTIGIEG: Sure. So college affordability is personal for us. Chasten and I have six-figure student debt. I believe in reducing student debt. It's logical to me that, if you can refinance your house, you ought to be able to refinance your student debt. I also believe in free college for low and middle-income students for whom cost could be a barrier.  (APPLAUSE)  I just don’t believe it makes sense to ask working-class families to subsidize even the children of billionaires. I think the children of the wealthiest Americans can pay at least a little bit of tuition. And while I want tuition costs to go down, I don’t think we can buy down every last penny for them.  Now, there's something else that doesn't get talked about in the college affordability debate. Yes, it needs to be more affordable in this country to go to college. It also needs to be more affordable in this country to not go to college. You should be able to live well, afford rent, be generous . ..  (APPLAUSE)  . . . to your church and Little League, whether you went to college or not.  (APPLAUSE)  ANDREW YANG: Jose, I’ve got $100,000 in student loan debt myself.  DIAZ-BALART: Let me get to you in . ..  REP. ERIC SWALWELL (D-N.Y.): You can’t count on the people who have been in government for the last 30 years, who were around when this problem was created, to be the ones to solve it. It’s going to be the next generation, the 40 million of us who can’t start a family, can’t take a good idea and start a business and can’t buy our first home. This is the generation that’s going to be able to solve student loan debt. This generation is ready to lead.  DIAZ-BALART: Mr. Yang, your — your signature policy is to give every adult in the United States $1,000 a month, no questions asked.  YANG: That's right.  DIAZ-BALART: I think that’s like $3.2 trillion a year. How would do you that?  YANG: I'm sorry?  DIAZ-BALART: How would you do that.  YANG: Oh, so it's difficult to do if you have companies like Amazon, trillion-dollar tech companies, paying literally zero in taxes while they're closing 30 percent of our stores.  Now, we need to put the American people in position to benefit from all these innovations in other parts of the economy. And if we had a value-added tax at even half the European level, it would generate over $800 billion in new revenue, which combined with the money in our hands, it would be the trickle-up economy, from our people, families and communities up. We would spend the money and it would circulate through our regional economies and neighborhoods, creating millions of jobs, making our families stronger and healthier.  We'd save money on things like incarceration, homelessness services, emergency room health care, and just the value gains from having a stronger, healthier, mentally healthier population would increase GDP by $700 billion.  This is the move that we have to make, particularly as technology is now automating away millions of American jobs, it's why Donald Trump is our president today that we automated away 4 million manufacturing jobs in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, and we are about to do the same thing to millions of retail jobs, call center jobs, fast food jobs, truck-driving jobs and other jobs through the economy.  DIAZ-BALART: So, Mr. Yang, if I get to understand a little bit better, Sir, you are saying $1,000 a month for everyone over 18, but a value-added tax so you can spend that $1,000 on value-added tax?  YANG: Well, the value-added tax would end up — you still would be increasing the buying power of the bottom 94 percent of Americans. You have to spend a lot of money for a mild value-added tax to eat up $12,000 a year per individual. So for the average family with two or three adults, it would be $24-36,000 a year.  DIAZ-BALART: okay. Congressman Swalwell, I want to talk a little bit about what Mr. Yang is talking about, and you just actually mentioned, that many Americans are worried about things like self-driving cars, robots, drones, artificial intelligence will cost them their jobs. What would you do to help people get the skills they need to adapt to this new world?  SWALWELL: We must always be a county where technology creates more jobs than it displaces. And I have seen the anxiety across America where the manufacturing floors go from 1,000 to 100 to one. So we have to modernize our schools, value the teachers who prepare our kids, wipe the student debt from any teacher that goes into a community that needs it, invest in America's communities especially where places where the best exports are people who move away to get skills.  But, Jose, I was 6 years old when a presidential candidate came to the California Democratic Convention and said it's time to pass the torch to a new generation of Americans. That candidate was then-Senator Joe Biden. Joe Biden was right when he said it was time to pass the torch to a new generation of Americans 32 years ago. He is still right today.  (APPLAUSE)  If we are going to solve the issues of automation, pass the torch. If we are going to solve the issues of climate chaos, pass the torch. If we're going to solve the issue of student loan debt, pass the torch. If we're going to end gun violence for families who are fearful of sending their kids to school, pass the torch.  DIAZ-BALART: Vice President, would you like to sing a torch song?  (LAUGHTER)  BIDEN: I would. I'm still holding on to that torch. I want to make it clear to you, look, the fact of the matter is what we have to do is make sure that everybody is prepared better to go on to educate — for an education. The fact is that that's why I propose us focusing on schools that are in distress.  That's why I think we should triple the amount of money we spend for Title I schools. That's why I think we should have universal pre-K. That's why I think every single person who graduates from high school, 65 out of 100 now need something beyond high school and we should provide for them to be able to get that education.  That's why there should be free community college, cutting in half the cost of college. That's why we should be in a position where we do not have anyone have to pay back a student debt when they get out if they are making less than $25,000 a year. Their debt is frozen, no interest payment until they get beyond that.  We can't put people in a position where they aren't able to go on and move on. And so, folks, there is a lot we can do, but we have to make continuing education available for everyone so that everyone can compete in the 21st Century. We are not doing that now.  (CROSSTALK)  BUTTIGIEG: As the youngest guy on the stage, I feel like I probably ought to contribute to the generational . ..  SANDERS: As part of Joe's generation, let me respond.  (CROSSTALK)  GILLIBRAND: Before we move on from education . ..  (CROSSTALK)  DIAZ-BALART: Please, please. Senator Sanders. And then I’ll let . ..  SANDERS: It's not generational. The issue is, who has the guts to take on Wall Street, to take on the fossil fuel industry, to take on the big money interests who have unbelievable influence over the economic and political life of this country?  (CROSSTALK)  DIAZ-BALART: Senator Harris — Senator Harris, I'm so sorry. We will allow all of you to speak. Senator Harris.  (CROSSTALK)  DIAZ-BALART: Senator Harris — please, we will let you all speak. Senator Harris.  (CROSSTALK)  HARRIS: Hey, guys, you know what? America does not want to witness a food fight, they want to know how we are going to put food on their table.  (APPLAUSE)  HARRIS: So on that point, part of the issue that is at play in America today, and we have all been traveling around the country, I certainly have, I'm meeting people who are working two and three jobs. You know, this president walks around talking about and flouting his great economy, right, my great economy, my great economy.  You ask him, well, how are you measuring this greatness of this economy of yours? And he talks about the stock market. Well, that's fine if you own stocks. So many families in America do not. You ask him, how are you measuring the greatness of this economy of yours? And they point to the jobless numbers and the unemployment numbers.  Well, yeah, people in America are working. They're working two and three jobs.  So when we talk about jobs, let’s be really clear. In our America, no one should have to work more than one job to have a roof over their head and food on the table.  (APPLAUSE)  DIAZ-BALART: Thank you very much, Senator.  (CROSSTALK)  HOLT: Yes, you have all — you've all expressed an interest in talking about health care. So let's talk about health care.  (UNKNOWN): I'd like to say something, if I might.  HOLT: And this is going to be a show of hands question. We asked a question about health care last night that spurred a lot of discussion, as you know. We're going to do it again now. Many people watching at home have health insurance through their employer. Who here would abolish their private health insurance in favorite of a government-run plan?  All right.  (APPLAUSE)  Kristin Gillibrand, Senator Gillibrand?  GILLIBRAND: Yeah, so now it's my turn.  BENNET: Good.  GILLIBRAND: So this is a very important issue. So the plan that Senator Sanders and I and others support, Medicare-for-all, is how you get to single payer. But it has a buy-in transition period, which is really important.  In 2005, when I ran for Congress in a 2-to-1 Republican district, I actually ran on Medicare-for-all, and I won that 2-to-1 Republican district twice. And the way I formulated it was simple. Anyone who doesn't have access to insurance they like, they could buy it at a percentage of income they could afford.  So that's what we put in to the transition period for our Medicare-for-all plan. I believe we need to get to universal health care as a right and not a privilege to single payer. The quickest way you get there is you create competition with the insurers. God bless the insurers, if they want to compete, they can certainly try, but they've never put people over their profits, and I doubt they ever will.  So what will happen is people will choose Medicare, you will transition, we will get to Medicare-for-all, and then your step to single-payer is so short, I would make it an earned benefit, just like Social Security, so that you buy in your whole life, it is always there for you, and it's permanent and it's universal.  HOLT: Senator, your time is up. I want to put that same question to Mayor Buttigieg.  BUTTIGIEG: Yeah, we've talked — look, everybody who says Medicare-for-all, every person in politics who allows that phrase to escape their lips has a responsibility to explain how you're actually supposed to get from here to there.  (APPLAUSE)  Now, here's how I would do it. It's very similar. I would call it Medicare-for-all who want it. You take something like Medicare, a flavor of that, you make it available on the exchanges, people can buy in. And then if people like us are right, that that will be not only a more inclusive plan, but a more efficient plan than any of the corporate answers out there, then it will be a very natural glide path to the single-payer environment.  But let's remember, even in countries that have outright socialized medicine, like England, even there, there's still a private sector. That's fine. It's just that for our primary care, we can't be relying on the tender mercies of the corporate system.  This one is very personal for me. I started out this year dealing with the terminal illness of my father. I make decisions for a living, and nothing could have prepared me for the kind of decisions our family faced.  But the thing we had going for us was that we never had to make those decisions based on whether it was going to bankrupt our family, because of Medicare. And I want every family to have that same freedom to do what is medically right, not live in financial fear.  (APPLAUSE)  HOLT: Your time is complete. Vice President Biden, I want to put the question to you. You were an architect — one of the architects of Obamacare. So where do we go from here?  BIDEN: Well, look, this is very personal to me. When my wife and daughter were killed in an automobile accident, my two boys were very, very badly injured. I couldn't imagine what it would be like if I'd not had adequate health care available to me.  And then, when my son came home from Iraq after a year, he was diagnosed with terminal cancer, and he was given months to live. I can't fathom what would have happened if, in fact, they said, by the way, the last six months of your life, you're on your own. We're cutting off. You've used up your time.  The fact of the matter is that the quickest, fastest way to do it is build on Obamacare, to build on what we did.  (APPLAUSE)  And, secondly — secondly, to make sure that everyone does have an option. Everyone, whether they have private insurance or employer insurance and no insurance, they, in fact, can buy in, in the exchange to a Medicare-like plan. And the way to do that — we can do it quickly.  Look, urgency matters. There's people right now facing what I faced, and what we faced, without any of the help I had. We must move now. I'm against any Democrat who opposes . ..  HOLT: Vice president Biden . ..  BIDEN: . . . and takes down Obamacare and any Republican who wants to get rid of Obamacare.  (APPLAUSE)  HOLT: Let me turn to Senator Sanders. Senator Sanders, you have basically — you basically want to scrap the private health insurance system as we know it and replace it with a government-run plan. None of the states that have tried something like that, California, Vermont, New York has struggled with it, have been successful. If politicians can’t make it in those states, how would you implement it on a national level? How does this work?  SANDERS: Lester, I find it hard to believe that every other major country on Earth, including my neighbor 50 miles north of me, Canada, somehow has figured out a way to provide health care to every man, woman, and child, and in most cases, they’re spending 50 percent per capita what we are spending.  (APPLAUSE)  Let's be clear. Let us be very clear. The function of health care today from the insurance and drug company perspective is not to provide quality care to all in a cost-effective way. The function of the health care system today is to make billions in profits for the insurance companies.  And last year, if you can believe it, while we pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs — and I will lower prescription drugs prices in half in this country — top 10 companies made $69 billion in profit. They will spend hundreds of millions of dollars lying to the American people, telling us why we cannot have a Medicare-for-all single-payer program.  HOLT: Senator, Senator, I just have — I just have to follow up there. How do you implement it on a national level?  (APPLAUSE)  SANDERS: I'm sorry?  HOLT: How do you implement it on a national level?  SANDERS: okay.  HOLT: Given the fact that it’s not succeeded and other states have tried?  SANDERS: I will tell you how we'll do it. We'll do it the way real change has always taken place, whether it was the labor movement, the civil rights movement, or the women's movement. We will have Medicare-for-all when tens of millions of people are prepared to stand up and tell the insurance companies and the drug companies that their day is gone, that health care is a human right, not something to make huge profits off of.  HOLT: Thank you.  All right, Ms. Williamson . ..  (APPLAUSE)  Ms. Williamson, this is a question for you.  (CROSSTALK)  HOLT: Excuse me. Excuse me. I'm addressing the question to Ms. Williamson. We've been talking a lot about access to health insurance. But for many Americans, their most pressing concern is the high cost of health care. How would you lower the cost of prescription drugs?  WILLIAMSON: Well, first of all, the government should never have made the deal with big pharma that they couldn't negotiate. That was just part of the regular corruption by which multinational corporations have their way with us.  You know, I want to say that while I agree with — and I’m with Senator Bennet and others, but I agree with almost everything here — I’ll tell you one thing, it’s really nice if we’ve got all these plans, but if you think we’re going to beat Donald Trump by just having all these plans, you’ve got another thing coming, because he didn’t win by saying he had a plan. He won by simply saying make America great again.  We’ve got to get deeper than just these superficial fixes, as important as they are. Even if we’re just talking about the superficial fixes, ladies and gentlemen, we don’t have a health care system in the United States. We have a sickness care system in the United States. We just wait until somebody gets sick, and then we talk about who’s going pay for the treatment and how they’re going to be treated.  (APPLAUSE)  What we need to talk about is why so many Americans have unnecessary chronic illnesses, so many more compared to other countries. And that gets back into not just the health — the big pharma, not just health insurance companies, it has to do with chemical policies, it has to do with environmental policies . ..  HOLT: All right, Ms. Williamson, your time is expired.  WILLIAMSON: It has to do with food policies.  (APPLAUSE)  It has to do with drug policies. It has to do with environment policies.  HOLT: Senator Bennet, a question for you. You want to keep the system that we have in place with Obamacare and build on it. You mentioned that a moment ago. Is that enough to get us to universal coverage?  BENNET: I believe that will get us the quickest way there. And I thought the vice president was very moving about this and Mayor Pete, as well.  I had prostate cancer recently, as you may know, and it's why I was a little late getting in the race. The same week, my kid had her appendectomy. And I feel very strongly that families ought to be able to have this choice. I think that's what the American people want.  I believe it will get us there quickly. There are millions of people in America that do not have health insurance today because they can't. They're too wealthy. Wealthy? They make too much money to be on Medicaid. They can't afford health insurance.  When Senator Sanders says that Canada is single payer, there are 35 million people in Canada. There are 330 million people in the United States, easily the number of people on a public option that — it could easily be 35 million. And for them, it would be Medicare-for-all, as Mayor Buttigieg says. But for others that want to keep it, they should be able to keep it. And I think that will be the fastest way to get where we need to go.  (CROSSTALK)  BENNET: Also, I will say — Bernie is a very honest person. He has said over and over again, unlike others that have supported this legislation, over and over again, that this will ban, make illegal all insurance except cosmetic, except insurance for — I guess that's for plastic surgery. Everything else is banned under the Medicare-for-all proposal . ..  HOLT: Let's go a little longer, but . ..  HARRIS: I'd like to add a point here.  HOLT: But I want — but obviously, Senator Sanders, you get a response.  HARRIS: I'd like to add a point here.  HOLT: Senator Sanders, just respond to that.  SANDERS: Just very briefly, you know, Mike, Medicare is the most popular . ..  BENNET: I agree.  SANDERS: . . . health insurance program in the country. People don't like their private insurance companies. They like their doctors and hospitals. Under our plan people go to go to any doctor they want, any hospital they want. We will substantially lower the cost of health care in this country because we'll stop the greed of the insurance companies.  (CROSSTALK)  HARRIS: . . . on this issue we have to think about how this affects real people.  (CROSSTALK)  HOLT: Senator Harris.  HARRIS: And the reality of how this affects real people is captured in a story that many of us heard and I will paraphrase.  There is, any night in America, a parent who has seen that their child has a temperature that is out of control, calls 911, what should I do? And they say, take the child to the Emergency Room. And so they get in their car and they drive and they are sitting in the parking lot outside of the Emergency Room looking at those sliding glass doors while they have the hand on the forehead of their child, knowing that if they walk through those sliding glass doors, even though they have insurance, they will be out a 5,000 deductible, $5,000 deductible when they walk through those doors.  That's what insurance companies are doing in America today.  (APPLAUSE)  GUTHRIE: We are going to continue this discussion. I wanted to . ..  (CROSSTALK)  GUTHRIE: Candidates, please. Candidates, please.  SWALWELL: I'm one of those parents. I was just in the emergency room. And I'm telling you . ..  (UNKNOWN): Congressman, thank you.  SWALWELL: . . . we fight health insurance companies every single week.  (UNKNOWN): Thank you.  SWALWELL: We stand in line and pay expensive prescription drugs. We have to have a health care guarantee. If you are sick, you're seen. And in America, you never go broke because of it.  GUTHRIE: okay. A lot of you have been talking tonight about these government health care plans that you have proposed in one form or another. This is a show of hands question, and hold them up for a moment so people can see. Raise your hand if your  government plan would provide coverage for undocumented immigrants.  (APPLAUSE)  okay. Let me start with you, Mayor Buttigieg, why? Mayor Buttigieg, why?  BUTTIGIEG: Because our country is healthier when everybody is healthier. And, remember, we are talking about something people are given a chance to buy into, in the same way that there are undocumented immigrants in my community who pay, they pay sales taxes, they pay property taxes, directly or indirectly.  This is not about a handout. This is an insurance program. And we do ourselves no favors by having 11 million undocumented people in our country be unable to access health care.  But, of course, the real problem is we shouldn't have 11 million undocumented people with no pathway to citizenship. It makes no sense. And the American people . ..  (APPLAUSE)  The American people agree on what to do. This is a crazy thing. If leadership consists of forming a consensus around a divisive issue, this White House has divided us around a consensus issue. The American people want a pathway to citizenship, they want protections for ""dreamers"". We need to clean up the lawful immigration system, like how my father immigrated to this country.  And as part of a compromise, we can do whatever common-sense measures are needed at the border, but Washington can’t deliver on something the American people want. What does that tell you about the system we are living in? It tells you it needs profound structural reform.  GUTHRIE: Mayor, thank you.  (APPLAUSE)  Vice President Biden, I believe you said that your health care plan would not cover undocumented immigrants. Could you explain your position?  BIDEN: I'm sorry, I beg your pardon?  GUTHRIE: I believe at the show of hands you did not raise your hand. Did you raise your hand?  BIDEN: No, I did.  GUTHRIE: okay. Sorry, sorry. So you said that they would be covered under your plan, which is different than Obamacare.  BIDEN: Yes. But here's the thing . ..  GUTHRIE: Can you explain that change?  BIDEN: Yes. You cannot let, as the mayor said, you cannot let people who are sick, no matter where they come from, no matter what their status, go uncovered. You can't do that. It's just going to be taken care of, period. You have to. It's the humane thing to do.  But here's the deal, the deal is that he's right about three things. Number one, they in fact contribute to the well-being of the country but they also, for example, they've increased the life span of Social Security because they have a job, they're paying a Social Security tax. That's what they're doing. It has increased the life span.  They would do the same thing in terms of reducing the overall cost of health care by them being able to be treated and not wait until they are in extremis.  The other thing is, folks, look, we can deal with these insurance companies. We can deal with the insurance companies by, number one, putting insurance executives in jail for their misleading advertising, what they're doing on opioids, what they're doing paying doctors to prescribe.  We could be doing this by making sure everyone who is on Medicare that the government should be able to negotiate the price for whatever the drug costs are. We can do this by making sure that we're in a position that we in fact allow people. Time's up?  (CROSSTALK)  HOLT: Hold off a minute, we need to take a short break here. We have a lot more we need to talk to all of you about. So stick with us. We're just getting started. We'll be back with more from Miami right after this.  (APPLAUSE)  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  (APPLAUSE)  HOLT: Welcome back from Miami.  (APPLAUSE)  Jose is going to lead off the questioning in this round.  DIAZ-BALART: Thank you very much.  Senator Harris, last month more than 130,000 migrants were apprehended at the southern border. Many of them are being detained, including small children, in private detention centers in Florida and throughout our country. Most of the candidates on this stage say the conditions at these facilities are abhorrent.  On January 20th, 2021, if you are president, what specifically would you do with the thousands of people who try to reach the United States every day and want a better life through asylum?  HARRIS: Immediately on January 20th of 2021, I will, first of all — we cannot forget our DACA recipients, and so I'm going to start there. I will immediately, by executive action, reinstate DACA status and DACA protection to those young people.  (APPLAUSE)  I will further extend protection for deferral of deportation for their parents and for veterans, who we have so many who are undocumented and have served our country and fought for our democracy.  (APPLAUSE)  I will also immediately put in place a meaningful process for reviewing the cases for asylum. I will release children from cages. I will get rid . ..  (APPLAUSE)  . . . of the private detention centers.  (APPLAUSE)  And I will ensure that this microphone that the president of the United States holds in her hand is used in a way . ..  (APPLAUSE)  . . . that is about reflecting the values of our country and not about locking children up, separating them from their parents. And I have to just say that we have to think about this issue in terms of real people. A mother who pays a coyote to transport her child through their country of origin, through the entire country of Mexico, facing unknown peril, to come here — why would that mother do that?  I will tell you. Because she has decided for that child to remain where they are is worse.  But what does Donald Trump do? He says, “Go back to where you came from.""  That is not reflective of our America and our values, and it's got to end.  (APPLAUSE)  DIAZ-BALART: Governor Hickenlooper . ..  (APPLAUSE)  Governor Hickenlooper . ..  (APPLAUSE)  Governor Hickenlooper, day one, if you are . ..  WILLIAMSON (?): Another thing, I . ..  DIAZ-BALART: Day one, at the White House, how do you respond?  WILLIAMSON: . . . deal with these — with these children?  DIAZ-BALART: I — let me get to you in just a second.  WILLIAMSON: I'm sorry.  DIAZ-BALART: Governor, day one, thousands of men, women and children cross the border, asking for asylum, for a better life. What do you do?  One — day one, hour one?  HICKENLOOPER: Well, certainly the images we have seen this week just compound the emotional impact that the world is judging us by. If you’d ever told me any time in my life that this country would sanction federal agents to take children from the arms of their parents, put them in cages, actually put them up for adoption — in Colorado, we call that kidnapping — I would have told you . ..  (APPLAUSE)  I would have told you it was unbelievable. And the first thing we have to do is recognize the humanitarian crisis on the border for what it is. We make sure that there are the sufficient facilities in place so that women and children are not separated from their families, that children are with their families.  We have to make sure that ICE is completely reformed and they begin looking at their job in a humanitarian way, where they're addressing the whole needs of the people that they are engaged with along the border, and we have to make sure ultimately that we provide not just shelter, but food, clothing, and access to medical care.  DIAZ-BALART: Ms. Williamson?  WILLIAMSON: Yes. What Donald Trump has done to these children — and it's not just in Colorado — Governor, you're right, it is kidnapping, and it's extremely important for us to realize that. If you forcibly take a child from their parents' arms, you are kidnapping them.  And if you take a lot of children and you put them in a detainment center, that's inflicting chronic trauma upon them. That's called child abuse. This is collective child abuse.  (APPLAUSE)  And when this is crime — both of those things are a crime. And if your government does it, that doesn't make it less of a crime. These are state-sponsored crimes.  (APPLAUSE)  DIAZ-BALART: Congressman . ..  WILLIAMSON: And what President — and what President Trump has done is not only attack these children, not only demonize these immigrants, he is attacking a basic principle of America's moral core. We open our hearts to the stranger.  This is extremely important. And it’s also important for all of us. Remember, and I have great respect for everyone who is on this stage. But we’re going to talk about what to do about health care? Well, where have you been, guys? Because it’s not just a matter of a plan. And I haven’t heard anybody on this stage who has talked about American foreign policy in Latin America and how we might have in the last few decades contributed to . ..  (APPLAUSE)  (CROSSTALK)  DIAZ-BALART: Senator Gillibrand, what would you do as president, with a reality?  GILLIBRAND: Well, one of the worst things about President Trump that he’s done to this country is he’s torn apart the moral fabric of who we are. When he started separating children at the border from their parents, the fact that seven children have died in his custody, the fact that dozens of children have been separated from their parents and they have no plan to reunite them.  So I would do a few things. First, I would fight for comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship. Second, I would reform how we treat asylum seekers at the border. I would have a community-based treatment center, where we're doing it within the communities, where asylum seekers are given lawyers, where there's real immigration judges, not employees of the attorney general, but appointed for life, and have a community-based system. I would fund border security.  But the worst thing President Trump has done is he's diverted the funds away from cross-border terrorism, cross-border human trafficking, drug trafficking, and gun trafficking, and he's given that money to the for-profit prisons. I would not be spending money in for-profit prisons to lock up children and asylum seekers.  (APPLAUSE)  DIAZ-BALART: We had a very spirited debate on this stage last night on the topic of decriminalization of the border. If you’d be so kind, raise your hand if you think it should be a civil offense rather than a crime to cross the border without documentation? Can we keep the hands up so we could see them?  (APPLAUSE)  BUTTIGIEG: Let's remember, that's not just a theoretical exercise. That criminalization, that is the basis for family separation. You do away with that, it's no longer possible. Of course it wouldn't be possible anyway in my presidency, because it is dead wrong.  We've got to talk about one other thing, because the Republican Party likes to cloak itself in the language of religion. Now, our party doesn't talk about that as much, largely for a very good reason, which was, we are committed to the separation of church and state and we stand for people of any religion and people of no religion.  But we should call out hypocrisy when we see it. And for a party that associates itself with Christianity, to say that it is okay to suggest that God would smile on the division of families at the hands of federal agents, that God would condone putting children in cages has lost all claim to ever use religious language again.  (APPLAUSE)  DIAZ-BALART: Vice President — Mr. Vice President, I don’t know if you raised your hand or were just asking to speak, but would you decriminalize crossing the border without documents?  BIDEN: The first thing — the first thing I would do is unite families. I'd surge immediately billions of dollars' worth of help to the region immediately.  Look, I talk about foreign policy. I'm the guy that got a bipartisan agreement at the very end of the campaign, at the very end of our term, to spend $740 million to deal with the problem, and that was to go to the root cause of why people are leaving in the first place. It was working.  We saw, as you know, a net decrease in the number of children who were coming. The crisis was abated. And along came this president, and he said — he immediately discontinued that.  We all talk about these things. I did it. I did it.  (APPLAUSE)  Seven hundred and forty — now look, second thing. Second thing we have to do. The law now requires the reuniting of those families. We would reunite those families, period. And if not, we'd put those children in a circumstance where they were safe until we could find their parents.  And lastly, the idea that he's in court with his Justice Department saying children in cages do not need a bed, do not need a blanket, do not need a toothbrush, that is outrageous.  DIAZ-BALART: Vice President — Vice President . ..  BIDEN: And we'll stop it.  DIAZ-BALART: . . . the Obama-Biden administration was — the Obama-Biden administration deported more than 3 million Americans. My question to you is, if an individual is living in the United States of America without documents, and that is his only offense, should that person be deported?  (UNKNOWN): No.  BIDEN: Depending if they committed a major crime, they should be deported. And the president was left in a — President Obama I think did a heck of a job. To compare him to what this guy is doing is absolutely I find immoral.  (APPLAUSE)  But the fact is that, look, we should not be locking people up. We should be making sure we change the circumstance, as we did, why they would leave in the first place. And those who come seeking asylum, we should immediately have the capacity to absorb them, keep them safe until they can be heard.  DIAZ-BALART: Fifteen seconds, if you could, if you wish to answer. Should someone who is here without documents, and that is his only offense, should that person be deported?  BIDEN: That person should not be the focus of deportation. We should fundamentally change the way we deal with things.  (APPLAUSE)  DIAZ-BALART: Senator . ..  (UNKNOWN): I think it's important . ..  SANDERS: I want to suggest that I agree with a lot of what Kamala just said. And that is, on day one, we take out our executive order pen and we rescind every damn thing on this issue that Trump has done.  (APPLAUSE)  Number two, number two, picking up on the point that Joe made, we've got to look at the root causes. And you have a situation where Honduras, among other things, is a failing state. Massive corruption. You've got gangs who are telling families that if a 10-year-old does not join that gang, that family is going to be killed.  What we have got to do on day one is invite the presidents and the leadership of Central America and Mexico together. This is a hemispheric problem that we have got to address.  (APPLAUSE)  DIAZ-BALART: Thank you. Congressman Swalwell, what do you do?  SWALWELL: Day one?  DIAZ-BALART: No, if someone is here without documents, and that is their only offense, is that person to be deported?  SWALWELL: No. That person can be a part of this great American experience.  (UNKNOWN): Exactly.  SWALWELL: That person can contribute. My congressional district is one of the most diverse in America, and we see the benefits when people contribute and they become a part of the community and they're not in the shadow economy.  Day one for me, families are reunited. This president, though, for immigrants, there's nothing he will not do to separate a family, cage a child, or erase their existence by weaponizing the census. And there is nothing that we cannot do in the courts and that I will not do as president to reverse that and to make sure that families always belong together.  DIAZ-BALART: Senator Harris?  HARRIS: Well, thank you. I will say — no, absolutely not, they should not be deported. And I actually — this was one of the very few issues with which I disagreed with the administration, with whom I always had a great relationship and a great deal of respect.  But on the secure communities issue, I was attorney general of California. I led the second-largest Department of Justice in the United States, second only to the United States Department of Justice, in a state of 40 million people.  And on this issue, I disagreed with my president, because the policy was to allow deportation of people who by ICE's own definition were non-criminals. So as attorney general, and the chief law officer of the state of California, I issued a directive to the sheriffs of my state that they did not have to comply with detainers, and instead should make decisions based on the best interests of public safety of their community.  Because what I saw — and I was tracking it every day — I was tracking it and saw that parents, people who had not committed a crime, even by ICE's own definition, were being deported.  And — but I have to add a point here. The problem with this kind of policy — and I know it as a prosecutor. I want a rape victim to be able to run in the middle of — to run in the middle of the street and wave down a police officer and report the crime against her. I want anybody who has been the victim of any real crime . ..  DIAZ-BALART: Senator, Senator . ..  HARRIS: . . . to be able to do that and not be afraid that if they do that, they will be deported, because the abuser will tell them it is they who is the criminal.  (APPLAUSE)  It is wrong. It is wrong.  HOLT: We're going to turn — we're going to turn to the issue of trade now, if we can. Last night, we asked the candidates on this stage to name the greatest geopolitical threat facing the U.S. Four of them mentioned China. U.S. businesses say China steals our intellectual property and party leaders on both sides accuse China of manipulating their currency to keep the cost of goods artificially low.  I want to ask this to Senator Bennet, to start off with. How would you stand up to China?  BENNET: Well, I think that, first of all, the biggest — the biggest threat to our national security right now is Russia, not China. And, second, on China, we've got — because of what they've done with our election.  In China, I think the president has been right to push back on China, but has done it in completely the wrong way. We should mobilize the entire rest of the world, who all have a shared interest in pushing back on China's mercantilist trade policies, and I think we can do that.  I'd like to answer the other question before this, as well.  HOLT: You have the time . ..  BENNET: When I — when I — when I see these kids at the border, I see my mom, because I know she sees herself, because she was separated from her parents for years during the Holocaust in Poland. And for Donald Trump to be doing what he's doing to children and their families at the border — I say this as somebody who wrote the immigration bill in 2013 that created a pathway to citizenship for 11 million people in this country — that had the most progressive Dream Act that's ever been conceived, much less passed, and got 68 votes in the Senate — that had $46 billion of border security in it that was sophisticated, 21st century border security, not a medieval wall . ..  HOLT: Senator, your time is expired.  BENNET: . . . and the president has turned the border of the United States into a symbol of nativist hostility . ..  HOLT: Senator, thank you . ..  BENNET: . . . that the whole world is looking at, when what we should be represented by is the Statue of Liberty, which has brought my parents to this country to begin with. We need to make a change.  (APPLAUSE)  HOLT: Mr. Yang, let me bring you in on this, on the issue of China. You have expressed a lot of concerns about technology and taking jobs. Are you worried about China? And if so, how would you stand up against it?  YANG: Well, I just want to agree that I think Russia is our greatest geopolitical threat, because they have been hacking our democracy successfully and they've been laughing their asses off about it for the last couple of years. So we should focus on that before we start worrying about other threats.  Now, China, they do pirate our intellectual property. It's a massive problem. But the tariffs and the trade war are just punishing businesses and producers and workers on both sides.  I met with a farmer in Iowa who said he spent six years building up a buying relationship in China that’s now disappeared and gone forever. And the beneficiaries have not been American workers or people in China. It’s been Southeast Asia and other producers that have then stepped into the void. So we need to crack down on Chinese malfeasance in the trade relationship, but the tariffs and the trade war are the wrong way to go.  HOLT: All right, Mayor Buttigieg . ..  (CROSSTALK)  HOLT: How would you — how would you stand up against China?  BUTTIGIEG: I mean, first of all, we've got to recognize that the China challenge really is a serious one. This is not something to dismiss or wave away. And if you look at what China is doing, they're using technology for the perfection of dictatorship.  But their fundamental economic model isn't going to change because of some tariffs. I live in the industrial Midwest. Folks who aren't in the shadow of a factory are somewhere near a soy field where I live. And manufacturers, and especially soy farmers, are hurting.  Tariffs are taxes. And Americans are going to pay on average $800 more a year because of these tariffs. Meanwhile, China is investing so that they could soon be able to run circles around us in artificial intelligence. And this president is fixated on the China relationship as if all that mattered was the export balance on dishwashers. We've got a much bigger issue on our hands.  But at a moment when their authoritarian model is being held up as an alternative to ours because ours looks so chaotic compared to theirs right now because of our internal divisions, the biggest thing we've got to do is invest in our own domestic competitiveness. If we disinvest . ..  HOLT: All right, Mayor, thank you.  BUTTIGIEG: . . . in our own infrastructure, education, we are never going to be able to compete. And if we really want to be an alternative, a democratic alternative, we actually have to demonstrate that we care about democratic values at home and around the world.  HOLT: Thank you for your answer.  (APPLAUSE)  GUTHRIE: We've got a good debate so far. We're going to take a quick break here, candidates. When we come back, the questioning continues with our colleagues. Chuck Todd, Rachel Maddow will be here. Much more with our candidates straight ahead.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  HOLT: Welcome back to the Democratic Presidential Debate from the Arsht Center in Miami.  GUTHRIE: As we continue the questioning, we want to bring in more members of our team.  DIAZ-BALART: So let's turn it over to Chuck Todd and Rachel Maddow.  (APPLAUSE)  TODD: Well, Rachel, I had a dream that we have done this before.  MADDOW: No.  TODD: No.  MADDOW: No.  TODD: No. Didn't happen.  MADDOW: This is definitely the first time.  TODD: Definitely first time.  Thank you, Lester, Savannah and Jose.  Let's quickly recap the rules one more time. Twenty candidates qualified for this first debate. We've heard from 10 of them from last night. We're hearing from 10 more tonight. The breakdown for each night was selected at random. The candidates will have 60 seconds to answer direct questions, 30 seconds for follow-ups, if necessary.  MADDOW: Because of this large field of candidates, not every person will be able comment on everything, but the less audience reaction there is, the more time they will all get.  (APPLAUSE)  Over the course of the next hour, we will hear from all of these candidates, but we are going to begin this hour with Mayor Buttigieg.  In the last five years, civil rights activists in our country have led a national debate over race and the criminal justice system. Your community of South Bend, Indiana, has recently been in uproar over an officer-involved shooting. The police force in South Bend is now 6 percent black in a city that is 26 percent black.  Why has that not improved over your two terms as mayor?  BUTTIGIEG: Because I couldn't get it done. My community is in anguish right now because of an officer-involved shooting, a black man, Eric Logan, killed by a white officer. And I'm not allowed to take sides until the investigation comes back. The officer said he was attacked with a knife, but he didn't have his body camera on. It's a mess. And we're hurting.  And I could walk you through all of the things that we have done as a community, all of the steps that we took, from bias training to de-escalation, but it didn't save the life of Eric Logan. And when I look into his mother's eyes, I have to face the fact that nothing that I say will bring him back.  This is an issue that is facing our community and so many communities around the country. And until we move policing out from the shadow of systemic racism, whatever this particular incident teaches us, we will be left with the bigger problem of the fact that there is a wall of mistrust put up one racist act at a time, not just from what's happened in the past, but from what's happening around the country in the present. It threatens the well-being of every community.  And I am determined to bring about a day when a white person driving a vehicle and a black person driving a vehicle, when they see a police officer approaching, feels the exact same thing . ..  MADDOW: Mr. Mayor . ..  BUTTIGIEG: . . . a feeling not of fear but of safety. I am determined to bring that day about.  MADDOW: Thank you, Mr. Mayor.  HICKENLOOPER: Mayor Buttigieg — Mayor Buttigieg, if I could . ..  (APPLAUSE)  HICKENLOOPER: . . . if I could have one question, just because I think . ..  MADDOW: Governor, I'll give you 30 seconds.  HICKENLOOPER: I think that the question they're asking in South Bend and I think across the country is why has it taken so long?  We had a shooting when I first became mayor, 10 years before Ferguson. And the community came together and we created an Office of the Independent Monitor, a Civilian Oversight Commission, and we diversified the police force in two years. We actually did de-escalation training.  I think the real question that America should be asking is why, five years after Ferguson, every city doesn't have this level of police accountability.  MADDOW: Governor Hickenlooper, thank you.  (APPLAUSE)  BUTTIGIEG: I've got to respond to that. Look, we have taken so many steps toward police accountability that, you know, the FOP just denounced me for too much accountability. We're obviously not there yet, and I accept responsibility for that because I'm in charge.  SWALWELL: If the camera wasn't on and that was the policy, you should fire the chief.  BUTTIGIEG: So under Indiana law, this will be investigated and there will be accountability for the officer involved.  SWALWELL: But you're the mayor. You should fire the chief — if that's the policy and someone died.  WILLIAMSON: All of these issues are extremely important, but they are specifics; they are symptoms. And the underlying cause has to do with deep, deep, deep realms of racial injustice, both in our criminal justice system and in our economic system. And the Democratic Party should be on the side of reparations for slavery for this very reason. I do not believe . ..  (APPLAUSE)  I do not believe that the average American is a racist, but the average American is woefully undereducated about the history of race in the United States.  MADDOW: Ms. Williamson, thank you very much . ..  (CROSSTALK)  TODD: Vice President Biden — I'm going to — we're going to get to you . ..  HARRIS: As the only black person on this stage, I would like to speak . ..  TODD: I . ..  HARRIS: . . . on the issue of race.  (APPLAUSE)  MADDOW: Senator Harris . ..  HARRIS: And so what I will say . ..  MADDOW: If I could preface this, we will give you 30 seconds, because we're going to come back to you on this again in just a moment. But go for 30 seconds.  HARRIS: okay. So on the issue of race, I couldn't agree more that this is an issue that is still not being talked about truthfully and honestly. I — there is not a black man I know, be he a relative, a friend or a co-worker, who has not been the subject of some form of profiling or discrimination.  Growing up, my sister and I had to deal with the neighbor who told us her parents couldn't play with us because she — because we were black. And I will say also that — that, in this campaign, we have also heard — and I'm going to now direct this at Vice President Biden, I do not believe you are a racist, and I agree with you when you commit yourself to the importance of finding common ground.  But I also believe, and it's personal — and I was actually very — it was hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country. And it was not only that, but you also worked with them to oppose busing.  And, you know, there was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bussed to school every day. And that little girl was me.  So I will tell you that, on this subject, it cannot be an intellectual debate among Democrats. We have to take it seriously. We have to act swiftly. As attorney general of California, I was very proud to put in place a requirement that all my special agents would wear body cameras and keep those cameras on.  (APPLAUSE)  MADDOW: Senator Harris, thank you. Vice President Biden, you have been invoked. We're going to give you a chance to respond.  (APPLAUSE)  Vice President Biden?  (APPLAUSE)  BIDEN: It's a mischaracterization of my position across the board. I did not praise racists. That is not true, number one. Number two, if we want to have this campaign litigated on who supports civil rights and whether I did or not, I'm happy to do that.  I was a public defender. I didn't become a prosecutor. I came out and I left a good law firm to become a public defender, when, in fact — when, in fact . ..  (APPLAUSE)  . . . when, in fact, my city was in flames because of the assassination of Dr. King, number one.  Number two, as the U.S. — excuse me, as the vice president of the United States, I worked with a man who, in fact, we worked very hard to see to it we dealt with these issues in a major, major way.  The fact is that, in terms of bussing, the bussing, I never — you would have been able to go to school the same exact way because it was a local decision made by your city council. That's fine. That's one of the things I argued for, that we should not be — we should be breaking down these lines.  But so the bottom line here is, look, everything I have done in my career, I ran because of civil rights, I continue to think we have to make fundamental changes in civil rights, and those civil rights, by the way, include not just only African Americans, but the LGBT community.  (APPLAUSE)  HARRIS: But, Vice President Biden, do you agree today — do you agree today that you were wrong to oppose bussing in America then? Do you agree?  BIDEN: I did not oppose bussing in America. What I opposed is bussing ordered by the Department of Education. That's what I opposed. I did not oppose . ..  HARRIS: Well, there was a failure of states to integrate public schools in America. I was part of the second class to integrate Berkeley, California, public schools almost two decades after Brown v. Board of Education.  BIDEN: Because your city council made that decision. It was a local decision.  HARRIS: So that's where the federal government must step in.  BIDEN: The federal government . ..  HARRIS: That's why we have the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act.  (APPLAUSE)  That's why we need to pass the Equality Act. That's why we need to pass the ERA, because there are moments in history where states fail to preserve the civil rights of all people.  BIDEN: I've supported the ERA from the very beginning when I ran for . ..  TODD: Vice President Biden, 30 seconds, because I want to bring other people into this.  BIDEN: I supported the ERA from the very beginning. I'm the guy that extended the Voting Rights Act for 25 years. We got to the place where we got 98 out of 98 votes in the United States Senate doing it. I've also argued very strongly that we, in fact, deal with the notion of denying people access to the ballot box. I agree that everybody, once they, in fact — anyway, my time is up. I'm sorry.  TODD: Thank you, Vice President.  HARRIS: All of these things have to do . ..  TODD: Senator Sanders, Senator Sanders, I'm going to go to you on this. You said on the day you launched your campaign that voters should focus on what people stand for, not a candidate's race or age or sexual orientation.  Many Democrats are very excited by the diversity of this field on this stage and on last night's stage and the perspective that diversity brings to this contest and to these issues.  SANDERS: Absolutely.  TODD: Are you telling Democratic voters that diversity shouldn't matter when they make this decision?  SANDERS: No, absolutely not. Unlike the Republican Party, we encourage diversity, we believe in diversity. That's what America is about.  But in addition to diversity, in terms of having more women, more people from the LGBT community, we also have to do something else. And that is, we have to ask ourselves a simple question, in that how come today the worker in the middle of our economy is making no more money than he or she made 45 years ago, and that in the last 30 years, the top 1 percent has seen a $21 trillion increase in their wealth?  We need a party that is diverse, but we need a party that has the guts to stand up to the powerful special interests who have so much power over the economic and political life of this country.  TODD: Senator Gillibrand, I want to give you 30 seconds on this.  GILLIBRAND: Well, first of all, where Bernie left off, we've heard a lot of good ideas on this stage tonight and a lot of plans, but the truth is, until you go to the root of the corruption, the money in politics, the fact that Washington is run by the special interests, you are never going to solve any of these problems.  I have the most comprehensive approach, that experts agree is the most transformative plan to actually take on political corruption, to get money out of politics through publicly funded elections, to have clean elections. If we do that and get money out of politics, we can guarantee health care as a right, not a privilege, we can deal with institutional racism, we can take on income inequality, and we can take on the corporate corruption that runs Washington.  (APPLAUSE)  BIDEN: And the first constitutional amendment to do that was introduced by me when I was young senator.  TODD: Thank you, Vice President. We want to shift topics here. Senator Bennet, the next question is for you.  On the issue of partisan gridlock, President Obama promised in 2012 that after his reelection, Republicans would want to work with Democrats, fever would break. That did not happen. Now Vice President Biden is saying the same thing, that if he is elected in 2020, both parties will want to work together.  Should voters believe that somehow if there is a Democratic president in 2021 that gridlock is going to magically disappear?  BENNET: Gridlock will not magically disappear as long as Mitch McConnell is there, first.  (APPLAUSE)  Second, second, second, that’s why it is so important for us to win not just the presidency, to have somebody that can run in all 50 states, but to win the Senate, as well. And that’s why we have to propose policies that can be supported, like Medicare act, so that we can build a broad coalition of Americans to overcome broken Washington, D.C. I agree with what Senator Gillibrand was saying. I share a lot of her views.  We need to end gerrymandering in Washington. We need to end political gerrymandering in Washington.  (APPLAUSE)  The court today said they couldn't do anything about it. We need to overturn Citizens United. The court was the one that gave us Citizens United. And the attack on voting rights in Shelby v. Holder is something we need to deal with.  All of those things has happened since Vice President Biden was in the Senate. And we face structural problems that we have to overcome with a broad coalition. It's the only way we can do it. We need to root out the corruption in Washington, expand people's right to get to the polls, and I think then we can succeed.  TODD: Time's up. Vice President Biden, 30 seconds. What — it does sound as if you haven't seen what's been happening in the United States Senate over the last 12 years. It didn't happen. Why?  BIDEN: I have seen what happened. Just since we were vice president, we needed three votes to pass an $800 billion Recovery Act that kept us from going into depression. I got three votes changed.  We needed to be able to keep the government from shutting down and going bankrupt. I got Mitch McConnell to raise taxes $600 billion by raising the top rate. And as recently as after president got elected, I was able to put together a coalition of the Cures Act to have billions of dollars go into cancer research, bipartisan.  But sometimes you can't do that. Sometimes you just have to go out and beat them. I went into 20 states, over 60 candidates, and guess what? We beat them, and we won back the Senate.  TODD: Thank you.  BENNET: Chuck, the problem with what the vice president . ..  TODD: Go ahead, 30 seconds.  (APPLAUSE)  BENNET: The problem with what . ..  TODD: Yeah, 30 seconds. Go ahead.  BENNET: Sometimes you do have to beat them, but — but the deal that he talked about with Mitch McConnell was a complete victory for the tea party. It extended the Bush tax cuts permanently. The Democratic Party had been running against that for 10 years.  We lost that economic argument, because that deal extended almost all those Bush tax cuts permanently and put in place the mindless cuts that we still are dealing with today that are called the sequester. That was a great deal for Mitch McConnell.  BIDEN: Oh, come on.  BENNET: It was a terrible deal for America.  (CROSSTALK)  TODD: Thank you, Senator. Thank you, Senator Bennet.  GILLIBRAND: And you heard . ..  TODD: Go ahead, 30 seconds.  GILLIBRAND: You heard from the Republicans that the reason why the Trump tax cut had to be passed is because they had to pay back their donors. You heard it. They actually said those words. So the corruption in Washington is real, and it is something that makes every one of the plans we've heard about over the last several months impossible.  And I have the most comprehensive approach to do it with clean elections, publicly funded elections, so we restore the power of our democracy into the hands of the voters, not into the Koch brothers.  We were talking about issues. Imagine — we’re in Florida — imagine the Parkland kids having as much power in our democracy as the Koch brothers or the NRA.  TODD: Thank you. Thank you, Senator Gillibrand.  GILLIBRAND: Imagine their voices carrying farther and wider than anyone else because their voice is needed.  (APPLAUSE)  TODD: Senator Gillibrand, I'm trying to get everybody in here.  GILLIBRAND: And as president, it's the first thing I'm going to do . ..  TODD: Thank you.  GILLIBRAND: . . . because nothing else is possible, whether it's education or health care or ending institutional racism.  TODD: Thank you very much.  MADDOW: Senator Sanders, I'd like to put a different question to you. Roe v. Wade has been the law of the land since 1973. Now that there is a conservative majority on the Supreme Court, several Republican-controlled states have passed laws to severely restrict or even ban abortion. One of those laws could very well make it to the Supreme Court during your presidency, if you're elected president. What is your plan if Roe is struck down in the court while you're president?  SANDERS: Well, my plan, as somebody who believes for a start that a woman's right to control her own body is a constitutional right, that government and politicians should not infringe on that right, we will do everything we can to defend Roe versus Wade.  (APPLAUSE)  Second of all, let me make a — let me make a promise here. You ask about litmus tests. My litmus test is I will never appoint any, nominate any justice to the Supreme Court unless that justice is 100 percent clear he or she will defend Roe v. Wade.  Third of all . ..  (APPLAUSE)  I do not believe in packing the court. We got a terrible 5-4 majority conservative court right now. But I do believe that constitutionally we have the power to rotate judges to other courts. And that brings in new blood into the Supreme Court and a majority, I hope, that will understand that a woman has the right to control her own body and the corporations cannot run the United States of America.  (CROSSTALK)  MADDOW: Hold on, I'm going to give you 10 additional seconds because the question was . ..  SANDERS: I'm sorry?  MADDOW: . . . what if the court has already overturned Roe and Roe is gone? All of the things you've just described would be to try to preserve Roe. If Roe is gone, what could you do as president to preserve abortion rights?  SANDERS: We will pass — well, first of all, let me tell you this. It didn't come up here, but let's face this, Medicare-for-all guarantees every woman in this country the right to have an abortion if she wants it.  MADDOW: Thank you, Senator.  GILLIBRAND: And can I address this for a second? And I want to talk directly, directly to America's women and to the men who love them. Women's reproductive rights are under assault by President Trump and the Republican Party. Thirty states are trying to overturn Roe v. Wade right now.  And it is mind-boggling to me that we are debating this on this stage in 2019 among Democrats whether women should have access to reproductive rights. I think we have to stop playing defense and start playing offense.  But let me tell you one thing about politics, because it goes to the corruption and the dealmaking. When the door is closed and negotiations are made, there are conversations about women's rights and compromises have been made on our backs. That's how we got to Hyde, that's how the Hyde Amendment was created, a compromise by leaders of both parties.  Then we have the ACA. During the ACA negotiation, I had to fight like heck with other women to make sure that contraception wasn't sold down the river, or abortion services. And so what we need to know is imagine this one question. When we beat President Trump and Mitch McConnell walks into the Oval Office, God forbid, to do negotiations, who do you want when that door closes to be sitting behind that desk, to fight for women's rights?  I have been the fiercest advocate for women's reproductive freedom for over a decade. And I promise you as president when that door closes, I will guarantee women's reproductive freedom no matter what.  MADDOW: Senator, thank you.  TODD: Thank you.  (APPLAUSE)  We are moving to climate. We are moving to climate, guys. Senator Harris, I'm addressing you first on this. You live in a state that has been hit by drought, wildfires, flooding. Climate change is a major concern for voters in your state, that's pretty obvious, obviously this state as well.  Last night voters heard many of the candidates weigh in on their proposals. Explain specifically what yours is.  HARRIS: Well, first of all, I don't even call it climate change. It's a climate crisis. It represents an existential threat to us as a species. And the fact that we have a president of the United States who has embraced science fiction over science fact will be to our collective peril.  I visited, while the embers were smoldering, the wildfires in California. I spoke with firefighters who were in the midst of fighting a fire while their own homes were burning. And on this issue it is a critical issue that is about what we must do to confront what is immediate and before us right now.  That is why I support a Green New Deal. It is why I believe on day one and as president will reenter us in the Paris agreement, because we have to take these issues seriously. And, frankly, we have a president of the United States, we talked about, you asked before what is the greatest national security threat to the United States?  It's Donald Trump.  (APPLAUSE)  And I'm going to tell you why. And I'm going to tell you why. Because I agree, climate change represents an existential threat. He denies the science. You want to talk about North Korea, a real threat in terms of nuclear arsenal, but what does he do? He embraces Kim Jong Un, a dictator, for the sake of a photo op.  Putin. You want to talk about Russia? He takes the word of the Russian president over the word of the American intelligence community when it comes to a threat to our democracy and our elections. These are the issues that are before us, Chuck.  TODD: I hear you. Thank you, Senator Harris.  (APPLAUSE)  Mayor Buttigieg, in your climate plan, if you are elected president, in your first term, how is this going to help farmers impacted by climate change in the Midwest?  BUTTIGIEG: Well, the reality is we need to begin adapting right away, but we also can't skip a beat on preventing climate change from getting even worse. It's why we need aggressive and ambitious measures. It's why we need to do a carbon tax and dividend.  But I would propose we do it in a way that is rebated out to the American people in a progressive fashion so that most Americans are made more than whole.  This isn't theoretical for us in South Bend, either. Parts of California are on fire. Right here in Florida, they're talking about sea level rise. Well, in Indiana I had to activate the emergency operations center of our city twice in less than two years. The first time was a 1,000-year flood and the next time was a 500-year flood.  This is not just happening on the Arctic ice caps; this is happening in the middle of the country. And we've got to be dramatically more aggressive moving forward.  Now, here's what very few people talk about. First of all, rural America can be part of the solution instead of being told they're part of the problem. With the right kind of soil management and other kind of investments, rural America could be a huge part of how we get this done.  And secondly, we've got to look to the leadership of local communities, you know, those networks of mayors in cities from around the world . ..  (CROSSTALK)  TODD: I'm trying to stick with the time as best we can.  BUTTIGIEG: . . . not even waiting for our national governments to catch up. We should have a Pittsburgh summit where we bring them together, as well as rejoining the Paris . ..  TODD: Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg.  (APPLAUSE)  MADDOW: I want to bring Governor Hickenlooper into this for a moment.  Governor, you have said that oil and gas companies should be a part of the solution on climate change. Lots of your colleagues onstage tonight have talked about moving away from fossil fuels entirely. Can oil and gas companies be real partners in this fight?  HICKENLOOPER: Well, I share the sense of urgency. I'm — I'm a scientist, so I — I recognize that, within 10 or 12 years of actually, you know, suffering irreversible damage, but, you know, guaranteeing everybody a government job is not going to get us there. Socialism, in that sense, is not the solution. We have to look at what really will make a difference.  In Colorado, we're closing a couple of coal plants, replacing it with wind, solar and batteries and the monthly bills go down. We've gone on — we're building a network for electric vehicles. We are working with the oil and gas industry and we've created the first methane regulations in the country.  Methane is 25 times worse than C02. And then we've got to get to that last part. I mean, the industrial — heavy industry, we haven't seen the plans yet. If you look at the real problem, C02, the worst polluters in CO2 is China, is the United States, and then it's concrete and its exhalation.  And beyond that, I think we've got to recognize that only by bringing people together, businesses, nonprofits — and we can't demonize every business. We've got to bring them together to be part of this thing. Because ultimately, if we're not able to do that . ..  MADDOW: Governor . ..  HICKENLOOPER: . . . we will be doomed to failure. We have no way of doing this without bringing everyone together.  MADDOW: Thank you.  Vice President Biden . ..  (APPLAUSE)  . . . on the issue of how you do this, Democrats are arguing robustly among themselves about what's the best way to tackle climate change. But if we're honest, many Republicans, including the president, are still not sure if they believe it is even a serious problem.  So are there significant ways you can cut carbon emissions if you have to do it with no support from Congress?  BIDEN: The answer is yes. Number one, in our administration, we built the largest wind farm in the world, the largest solar energy facility in the world. We drove down the price, competitive price of both of those renewable energy — renewable sources.  I would immediately insist that we in fact build 500,000 recharging stations throughout the United States of America, working with governors, mayors and others, so that we can go to a full electric vehicle future by the year 2020 — by the year 2030.  I would make sure that we invested $400 million in new science and technology, to be the exporter not only of the green economy, but economy that can create millions of jobs. But I would immediately join the Paris Climate Accord. I would up the ante in that accord, which it calls for, because we make up 15 percent of the problem; 85 percent of the world makes up the rest. And so we have to have someone who knows how to corral the rest of the world, bring them together and get something done, like we did in our administration.  MADDOW: Senator Sanders . ..  (APPLAUSE)  . . . I want to give you 30 seconds to follow-up, but I'm going to hold to you 30.  SANDERS: Look, the old ways are no longer relevant. The scientists tell us we have 12 years before there is irreparable damage to this planet. This is a global issue. What the president of the United States should do is not deny the reality of climate change but tell the rest of the world that, instead of spending a trillion and a half dollars on weapons of destruction, let us get together for the common enemy, and that is to transform the world's energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. The future of the planet rests on us doing that.  MADDOW: Thank you, Senator.  (APPLAUSE)  TODD: Before we go — hang on . ..  (APPLAUSE)  MADDOW: Before we leave this topic . ..  SWALWELL (?): Here's the solution. Pass the torch. Pass the torch to the generation that's going to feel the effects of climate change.  SANDERS: No, take on the fossil fuels, and that's the solution.  MADDOW: Before we leave this topic, here's something you all want to weigh in on.  (CROSSTALK)  GILLIBRAND: . . . to the Republican Party.  TODD: Just — just . ..  MADDOW: Hold one moment.  TODD: Just trust us on this. We're going to . ..  WILLIAMSON: The fact that somebody has a younger body doesn't mean you don't have old ideas. John Kennedy — John Kennedy . ..  (CROSSTALK)  WILLIAMSON: . . . did not say — John Kennedy did not say — I have a plan to get a man to the moon and so we're going to do it and I think we can all work and maybe we can get a man on the moon. John Kennedy said, by the end of this decade, we are going to put a man on the moon.  Because John Kennedy was back in the day when politics included the people and included imagination and included great dreams and included great plans.  MADDOW: Ms. Williamson . ..  TODD: Thank you, Ms. Williamson.  WILLIAMSON: And I have had a career not making the political plans, but I have had a career harnessing the inspiration and the motivation and the excitement of people, masses of people.  TODD: Thank you, Ms. Williamson.  WILLIAMSON: When we know that when we say . ..  TODD: Thank you.  WILLIAMSON: . . . we are going to turn from a dirty economy to a clean economy, we're going to have a Green New Deal, we're going to create millions of jobs, we're going to do this within the next 12 years, because I'm not interested in just winning the next election. We are interested in our grandchildren.  TODD: Thank you, Ms. Williamson.  WILLIAMSON: Then it will happen.  TODD: All right. We got to sneak in a break in a minute, but before we go, I'm going to go down the line here and I'm asking you please for one or two words only. All right, please.  (LAUGHTER)  MADDOW: Really.  TODD: President Obama in his first year wanted to address both health care and climate. And he could only get one signature issue accomplished; it was, obviously, health care. He didn't get to do climate change. You may only get one shot, and your first issue that you're going to push, you get one shot that it may be the only thing you get passed, what is that first issue for your presidency.  Eric Swalwell, you're first.  SWALWELL: For Parkland, for Orlando, for every community affected by gun violence, ending gun violence.  (APPLAUSE)  TODD: Senator Bennet?  BENNET: Climate change and the lack of economic mobility Bernie talks about.  TODD: Senator Gillibrand?  GILLIBRAND: Passing a family bill of rights that includes a national paid leave plan, universal pre-K, affordable day care, and making sure that women and families can thrive in the workplace no matter who they are.  HARRIS: Oh, I like that.  TODD: That was pretty good. Senator Harris?  (CROSSTALK)  HARRIS: . . . so, passing a middle-class and working families tax cut . ..  TODD: That's one.  HARRIS: . . . DACA, guns, and . ..  TODD: I've given you credit for the first thing you said, the tax cuts.  (CROSSTALK)  TODD: Senator Sanders, first thing?  SANDERS: Chuck, the premise that there's only one or two issues out there . ..  TODD: I'm not saying there isn't one or two.  SANDERS: This country faces enormous crises.  TODD: Senator Sanders . ..  SANDERS: We need a political revolution. People have got to stand up and take on the special interests. We can transform this country.  TODD: Vice President Biden, your first issue, Mr. Vice President?  BIDEN: I think you're so underestimating what Barack Obama did. He's the first man to bring together the entire world, 196 nations, to commit to deal with climate change, immediately.  (APPLAUSE)  So I don't buy that. But the first thing I would do is make sure that we defeat Donald Trump, period.  (APPLAUSE)  TODD: okay, Mayor Buttigieg, your first priority, your first issue as president that you are going to block and tackle.  BUTTIGIEG: We've got to fix our democracy before it's too late. Get that right, climate, immigration, taxes, and every other issue gets better.  TODD: Mr. Yang?  YANG: I would pass a $1,000 freedom dividend for every American adult starting at age 18, which would speed us up on climate change, because if you get the boot off of people's throats, they'll focus on climate change much more clearly.  TODD: okay. Governor Hickenlooper?  HICKENLOOPER: I would do a collaborative approach to climate change and I would pronounce it well before the election to make sure we don't reelect the worst president in American history.  TODD: And Ms. Williamson, the last word.  WILLIAMSON: My first call is to the prime minister of New Zealand, who said that her goal is to make New Zealand the place where it's the best place in the world for a child to grow up, and I would tell her, girlfriend, you are so wrong, because the United States of America is going to be the best place in the world for a child to grow up.  TODD: Thank you.  WILLIAMSON: We are going to have . ..  TODD: You guys were close with the short — at least it was shorter responses.  MADDOW: No, they weren't. Not at all.  TODD: All right. C-minus.  MADDOW: We're going to take a quick break. We'll be right back with these candidates right after this.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  MADDOW: Welcome back to the Democratic candidates' debate in Miami. We're going to continue the questioning now with Lester in the audience. We are? We are — a second are going to have a question from Lester in the audience. But that was just a fake-out.  (LAUGHTER)  TODD: Let’s go to — we’re going to go to the issue of guns. And . ..  MADDOW: Congressman Swalwell, among this field of candidates, you have a unique position on gun reform. You're proposing that the government should buy back every assault weapon in America and it should be mandatory. How do you envision that working, especially in states where gun rights are a strong flash point?  SWALWELL: Keep your pistols, keep your rifles, keep your shotguns, but we can take the most dangerous weapons from the most dangerous people. We have the NRA on the ropes, because of the moms, because of the Brady Group, because of Giffords, because of March for our Lives.  (APPLAUSE)  But I'm the only candidate on this stage calling for a ban and buyback of every single assault weapon in America. I have seen the plans of the other candidates here. They would all leave 15 million assault weapons in our communities. They wouldn't do a single thing to save a single life in Parkland.  I will approach this issue as a prosecutor. I'll approach it as the only person on this stage who has voted and passed background checks. But also as a parent, of a generation who sends our children to school where we look at what they're wearing so we can remember it in case we have to identify them later. A generation who has seen thousands of black children killed in our streets. And a generation who goes to the theater and we actually look where the fire exits are. We don't have to live this way. We must be a country who loves our children more than we love our guns.  (APPLAUSE)  MADDOW: Senator Sanders, a Vermont newspaper recently released portions of an interview you gave in 2013 in which you said: “My own view on guns is, everything being equal, states should make those decisions.""  SANDERS: No.  MADDOW: Has your thinking changed since then? Do you now think there is a federal role to play?  SANDERS: No, that's a mischaracterization of my thinking.  MADDOW: It's a quote of you.  SANDERS: Look, we have a gun . ..  (LAUGHTER)  SANDERS: We have a gun crisis right now, 40,000 people a year are getting killed. In 1988, Rachel, when it wasn't popular, I ran on a platform of banning assault weapons and in fact lost that race for Congress. I have a D-minus voting record from the NRA. And I believe that what we need is comprehensive gun legislation that, among other things, provides universal background, we end the gun show loophole, we end the straw man provision, and I believed in 1988 and I believe today.  (CROSSTALK)  SANDERS: Assault weapons are weapons from the military and that they should not be on the streets of America.  SWALWELL: Your plan leaves them on the streets. You leave 15 million on the streets.  SANDERS: We ban the sale — we ban the sale and distribution . ..  SWALWELL: Will you buy them back?  SANDERS: . . . and that's what I've believed for many years.  SWALWELL: Will you buy them back?  SANDERS: If people want to buy — if the government wants to do that and people want to bring them back, yes.  SWALWELL: You are going to be the government, will you buy them back?  SANDERS: Yes.  MADDOW: Senator Harris, we're going to give you 30 seconds.  HARRIS: Thank you. I think your idea is a great one, Congressman Swalwell. And I'll say that there are a lot of great ideas. The problem is Congress has not had the courage to act which is why when elected president of the United States, I will give the United States Congress 100 days to pull their act together, bring all these good ideas together, and put a bill on my desk for signature. And if they do not, I will take executive action and I will put in place . ..  (APPLAUSE)  . . . the most comprehensive background check policy we've had. I will require the ATF to take the licenses of gun dealers who violate the law. And I will ban by executive order the importation of assault weapons. Because I'm going to tell you, as a prosecutor, I have seen more autopsy photographs than I care to tell you. I have hugged more mothers who are the mothers of homicide victims. And I have attended more police officer funerals.  It is enough. It is enough. There have been plenty of good ideas from members of the United States Congress. There has been no action. As president, I will take action.  (APPLAUSE)  MADDOW: Mayor Buttigieg, I want to bring you in on this, Sir. A lot of discussions about assault rifles that are often shorthanded as military-style weapons. You are the only person on this stage tonight with military experience as a veteran of the Afghanistan War.  (APPLAUSE)  Will military families — does that inform your thinking on this view? Do you believe that military families or America's veterans will at large have a different take on this than the other Americans who we have been talking about and who Congressman Swalwell is appealing to with his buyback program?  BUTTIGIEG: Yes, of course, because we trained on some of these kinds of weapons. Look, every part of my life experience informs this, being the mayor of a city where the worst part of the job is dealing with violence. We lose as many as were lost at Parkland every two or three years in my city alone.  And this is tearing communities apart. If more guns made us safer, we would be the safest country on earth. It doesn't work that way.  (APPLAUSE)  And common-sense measures like universal background checks can't seem to get delivered by Washington, even when most Republicans, let alone most Americans, agree it's the right thing to do. And as somebody who trained on weapons of war, I can tell you that there are weapons that have absolutely no place in American cities or neighborhoods in peacetime, ever.  (APPLAUSE)  MADDOW: Vice President Biden, 30 seconds.  BIDEN: A real 30 seconds?  MADDOW: A real 30 seconds.  BIDEN: okay. I'm the only person that has beaten the NRA nationally. I'm the guy that got the Brady Bill passed, the background checks, number one.  (APPLAUSE)  Number two, we increased that background check when — during the Obama-Biden administration. I'm also the only guy that got assault weapons banned, banned, and the number of clips in a gun banned.  And so, folks, look, and I would buy back those weapons. We already started talking about that. We tried to get it done. I think it can be done. And it should be demanded that we do it. And that's a good expenditure of money.  And, lastly, we should have smart guns. No gun should be able to be sold unless your biometric measure could pull that trigger. It's within our right to do that. We can do that. Our enemy is the gun manufacturers, not the NRA, the gun manufacturers.  MADDOW: Mr. Vice President . ..  SWALWELL: But the NRA is taking orders from the gun manufacturers, that's the problem.  TODD: All right. Lester Holt has our next question.  Lester, take it away.  HOLT: All right, Chuck. This is a question from our viewers. We put some — the suggestions that — asked maybe they could share some. Here's one that came from Kathleen (ph) from Canby, Oregon, who writes many fear the current administration has inflicted irrevocable harm on our governing institutions and norms and the process on our reputation abroad. The question is, what do you see as important early steps in reversing the damage done? And we'll put this one to Senator Bennet.  BENNET: Thank you very much. What an excellent question. First of all, we have to restore our democracy at home. The rest of the world is looking for us for leadership. We have a president who doesn't believe in the rule of law, he doesn't believe in freedom of the press, he doesn't believe in an independent judiciary. He believes in the corruption that he's brought to Washington, D.C. And that is what we have to change, and that's why everybody is up here tonight, and I appreciate the fact that they're up here for that reason.  Second, we've got to — we've got to restore the relationships that he's destroyed with our allies, not just in Europe. He flew to the G-20 last night and attacked Japan, Germany, and a third ally of ours without saying anything about North Korea or Russia.  And when you've got a situation where you have a president who says something happened in the Straits of Hormuz and the whole world doesn't know whether to believe it or not, that is a huge problem when it comes to the national security of the United States of America. And we need to change that.  (APPLAUSE)  TODD: This is a perfect time — thank you, Senator. This is a perfect time for me to do another one of these down the line. And this is what this question is, which is, you're going to have to — you're likely going to have to reset a relationship between America and another country or entity if you become president because of some — perhaps because of some relationship that you just mentioned about President Trump. What is the first relationship you would like to reset as president? I'm going to go down the line, and I'll start with Ms. Williamson.  WILLIAMSON: Well, one of my first phone calls would be to call the European leaders and say we're back . ..  TODD: Thank you.  WILLIAMSON: . . . because I totally understand how important it is that the United States be part of the Western alliance.  TODD: okay, I want — I'm trying to get one or two words here. I hear you. Governor Hickenlooper?  HICKENLOOPER: You know, I talk about constant engagement. And I think the first person — the first country I would go to . ..  TODD: Yeah.  HICKENLOOPER: . . . and I understand they've been cheating and stealing and (inaudible) would be China . ..  TODD: okay.  HICKENLOOPER: . . . because if we're going to do — deal with public health pandemics, if we're doing to deal with . ..  TODD: Thank you.  HICKENLOOPER: . . . all the challenges of the globe, we've got to have relationships with everyone.  TODD: Mr. Yang, we're trying to squeeze in a couple more things before we go to another break. Mr. Yang?  YANG: China. We need cooperate with them on climate change, AI, and other issues, North Korea.  TODD: Thanks for the quickness. Mayor Buttigieg?  BUTTIGIEG: We have no idea which of our most important allies he will have pissed off worse between now and then. What we know is that our relationship with the entire world needs to change.

Aired 8-9p ET  Aired May 02, 2019 - 20:00 ET  THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.    [20:00:09] ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST: Good evening.    We begin tonight with breaking news. President Trump has just said for the first time that he will likely not let former White House counsel Don McGahn comply with the subpoena to testify before the House Judiciary Committee as part of its obstruction of justice investigation.    (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)    DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Well, I've had him testifying already for 30 hours.    INTERVIEWER: So is the answer no?    TRUMP: It's really -- I don't think I could let him and then tell everybody else you can't but especially him because he was a counsel. So they testified for many hours, all of them. Many, many, many people.    INTERVIEWER: So, as far as you're concerned it's kind of done, it's done?    (CROSSTALK)    TRUMP: And the others can't.    INTERVIEWER: So, is it done?    TRUMP: I would say it's done. We've been through this. Nobody has ever done what I've done. I've given total transparency. It's never happened before like this.    INTERVIEWER: So Congress should be --    TRUMP: They shouldn't be looking anymore. This is all -- it's done.    (END VIDEO CLIP)    COOPER: Hasn't given total transparency, but that's obvious.    It's done, he says. The president all but saying he'll exert executive privilege to block the testimony, although it remains an open question if he can claim executive privilege at this point given that McGahn has already testified, we'll ask Senator Mazie Hirono about that coming up, as well as our legal team.    All of this comes after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and some heated words directed at another man who did testify on Capitol Hill yesterday.    (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)    REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): The attorney general of the United States of America was not telling the truth to the Congress of the United States. That's a crime.    (END VIDEO CLIP)    COOPER: A crime, which is quite an accusation. A Justice Department spokeswoman called Pelosi's comments reckless and false. Her tough talk as Barr refusing to show up today before the same committee that wants to talk to McGahn, the House Judiciary Committee. Instead, there was an empty chair. There were no questions, no answers and a chicken.    That's right, chicken. One Democrat on the committee call the attorney general chicken Barr for not showing up and chowed down on some KFC.    It has been that kind of a day and it's that kind of a night.    Let's go to Kaitlan Collins at the White House.    So, what else did the president say, Kaitlan?    KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Anderson, we saw the president tonight draw the clearest line between not letting McGahn testify and not letting really anyone testify. In the last few weeks as he talked about this tactic of fighting all these subpoenas, he hasn't brought up his former White House counsel specifically, but he did so tonight.    But, Anderson, one thing we didn't hear from the president was this criticism that he has been saying privately about Don McGahn, especially after the Mueller report came out and McGahn was a central figure in it when he said that essentially the president had told him to fire the special counsel, something that the president and the attorney general are both now disputing.    COOPER: Do we know if the White House plans to block any other presidential adviser or executive branch officials from testifying? It sounds like they're going to block them all if they can.    COLLINS: That's what the president seemed to be getting there. Essentially, if he lets McGahn testify, then other cabinet officials or West Wing officials, he's going to have to let them testify, too.    Now the president seemed to get out ahead a little bit of his legal team here, because they've been discussing privately what they're going to do about the subpoena for Don McGahn, how they can block him from testifying at all or block certain parts of it, but the president seemed to go farther than they have, what they have even been saying privately about not letting McGahn testify at all. Whether or not he can actually do that, it doesn't seem to be a conclusion that the White House has come to yet.    COOPER: All right. Kaitlan Collins, thanks very much.    I want to get reaction to all this now from a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Democratic Senator Mazie Hirono joins us now.    Senator Hirono, you hear --    SEN. MAZIE HIRONO (D-HI): Good evening.    COOPER: Good evening.    You hear the president saying he doesn't plan or he doesn't think it likely to let Don McGahn testify before Congress. He already let him testify for 30 hours before the special counsel. The whole thing is done.    What do you say to that?    HIRONO: What I say is we should always remember that there are two things that the president cares most about. One is protecting himself. The second is money.    So he is in the process of protecting himself. You can explain a lot of what the president does by knowing that he will do anything to protect himself.    COOPER: So is there -- what is the option? If he exerts executive privilege, what, it just goes to the courts?    HIRONO: I think that's one of the modus operandi of Trump when he was in business, that he would delay things. He would file lawsuits, or he will file for bankruptcy, leaving everybody holding the bag. He treats the presidency like he is still running a business in the kind of ways that he ran his business, which are very questionable tactics.    So I think, yes, I don't think it bothers him very much if he asserts executive privilege over somebody who has already testified and have them that go to the courts and hope that it gets strung up through the election. He does not care about that sort of thing.    COOPER: Speaker Pelosi said today that Attorney General Barr lied in his testimony and committed a crime in front of you and the rest of the Senate Judiciary Committee. I'm wondering if you agree with her. And if so, is there anything to do about it? Because Senate Democrats obviously don't have the majority to force any kind of recourse.    HIRONO: Well, that's a sad thing. And if we had Republicans in the Senate who have cared about truth as much as I would hope they would, then we'd be able to get somewhere. [20:05:05] But thankfully, the House is in Democratic hands, and as    Speaker Pelosi said, he -- Barr lied regarding his answer to the question from Charlie Crist and also on the Senate side, in his response to Chris Van Hollen.    COOPER: I want to play your answers you had in response to the attorney general yesterday. I just want to play this.    (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)    HIRONO: From the beginning, you were addressing an audience of one, that person being Donald Trump.    But now we know more about your deep involvement in trying to cover up for Donald Trump. Being attorney general of the United States is a sacred trust. You have betrayed that trust. America deserves better.    You should resign. I think you know what I'm talking about. Please, please, Mr. Attorney General. Give us some credit for knowing what the hell is going on around here with you.    SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): Not really -- to this line of questioning. Listen, you slandered this man --    BARR: What I sort of want to know is, how do we get to this point?    HIRONO: I do not think I'm slandering anyone.    GRAHAM: All I would say --    HIRONO: Mr. Chairman, I am done. Thank you very much.    GRAHAM: And you slandered this man from top to bottom. So if you want more of this, you're not going to get it. If you want to ask him questions, you can.    HIRONO: Certainly have your opinion.    UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    (END VIDEO CLIP)    COOPER: Were you surprised to hear senator graham saying you slandered the attorney general?    HIRONO: Well, truth is a defense of slander and opinion is not slander. So, but we saw the chairman going off and he did that.    But the only person who can sue me for that, not to mention as legislators, we have some protections as to what we say, but the only person who can sue me is Barr. So there you go.    It was very disheartening yesterday to watch and listen to the attorney general of the United States act like he is a defense attorney for the president. He did that very well. What he didn't do very well was be honest with the people of our country. And that is why he's not the only time he's very good at obfuscating and skirting questions. He couldn't even answer my questions whether it was OK for the White House counsel to be told to fire Mueller and then to lie about it, whether it was OK to dangle pardons before witnesses and all of that.    He wouldn't answer that. He kept going back to the criminality aspects of it. So, I call this -- there is a moral dead zone in the Trump White House.    COOPER: You know, the Republicans will push back and say, well, look, you know, you and others have said the attorney general is acting like the president's lawyer, not the attorney general for the people of the United States and for the United States. Republicans pushed back and that and said, look, Bobby Kennedy was the attorney general under JFK. He was clearly aligned with JFK. They say Eric Holder was close to President Obama, was clearly in their opinion watching out for President Obama.    The idea being that what Barr is doing, whatever you may think of it, is not that dissimilar from what past attorneys general have done.    HIRONO: That's what they'd like everybody to think. But you have an attorney general who auditioned for the job by writing a totally unasked for 19-page document that said a sitting president cannot be charged with obstruction of justice. That's about half of the Mueller report, part two, basically.    And guess what? When the Mueller report comes out and Mueller says there are these indicators and factors relating to an obstruction of justice charge, he couldn't come to a decision on that, but leaving it as it was and Barr jumps in and says, oh, well, there is no obstruction there. Very much like his 19-pager.    And then you have the attorney general who puts out a four-page -- first, he called ate summary, then it's really not a sum risks and then we find out in a bombshell that just a few days that we find out that Mueller had contacted and written to Barr saying you have not characterized our work accurately. And then you have the attorney general before all this comes out regarding the Mueller letter, you have the attorney general having a press conference.    COOPER: Yes.    HIRONO: -- to make the president look good.    What is that? Let's talk about what we're confronted with in the here and now. We have an attorney general who is acting like the defense attorney for the president. He should have taken that job as defense attorney when the president offered it to him.    COOPER: Justice Department will allow Mueller to testify? I mean, obviously, not to the Senate, because Lindsey Graham has made it clear he won't ask Mueller to testify, but at the house.    HIRONO: I think when Barr was asked that, I think he said he doesn't see why not, but I think there will be why-nots because maybe the president will put some pressure on his attorney general to say he doesn't want anybody testifying.    [20:10:06] As far as the president and Lindsey Graham are concerned, it's all over.    It is not all over because we need to get to the bottom of what's going on here. So, you know, the House thankfully is proceeding with their investigation, and I think the next step for Jerry Nadler is to issue a subpoena for Barr to testify, and we all know that he's talking with Mueller directly about Mueller testifying and whether or not the president can force everyone not to testify, that lead to more lawsuits. This is what the president wants.    COOPER: Yes. Senator Mazie Hirono, appreciate your time. Thank you.    HIRONO: Sure.    COOPER: Joining us now, CNN chief legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin, former federal prosecutor Robert Ray, who served as part of the Whitewater independent counsel, also Elliot Williams, former deputy assistant attorney general during the Obama administration, and CNN political analyst Kirsten Powers.    Jeff, the president saying he doesn't think he'll allow former White House Don -- or that he can't allow McGahn to testify before Congress. Can he exert executive privilege here? Was that de facto waived when McGahn testified to Mueller?    JEFFREY TOOBIN, CNN CHIEF LEGAL ANALYST: I don't think he can cite it anymore because he's twice had the opportunity to prevent the disclosure of McGahn's testimony. First, he allowed McGahn to be interviewed by Mueller, and then presented with the Mueller report, chose not to object to the disclosures that McGahn made. And that to me is a waiver of executive privilege.    Putting aside the issue of whether he could do it at all, but this seems to be an absolutely clear case of waiver. And once you allow a privilege to be violated, any privilege, whether it's a marital privilege or religious privilege or executive pilgrimage, you can't then say oh, by the way, now I want to protect the information that might be covered.    So I think if it goes to court, he'll lose. He'll be able to delay it. But I think he'll lose.    COOPER: Robert, do you agree he would lose in court?    ROBERT RAY, FORMER WHITEWATER INDEPENDENT COUNSEL: Not so sure about that. I know -- I respect Jeffrey's view. I know that Jerry Nadler is of a similar view. In fact, we raised it, Anderson, you and I when he was on set me I guess several weeks ago. I think it's one thing to say that, you know, within the executive branch was sort of the first round of this, I don't think there can be a waiver.    The only place where a waiver arguably occurs is the point at which the White House and in this instance the attorney general decide to release the redacted Mueller report containing that information to the Congress and thereby ultimately to the American people.    However, while Jeffrey's right that generally speaking, this issue is one where, you know, waiver does apply, it gets a little more complicated when you're talking about separation of powers issues, and specifically, on the question of how far does that waiver extend. In other words, there is a general principle about subject matter waiver, and I would agree that with regard to those portions of McGahn's prior statements that are made during the course of the investigation, but courts because of separation of powers principles, at least in my experience, take a very narrow view of that waiver when it involves the two branches of government in a dispute.    So it's not quite the same as looking at, you know, marital privilege or attorney-client privilege. There is another complicating feature here.    COOPER: Let me bring Kirsten.    The president can say over and over again that this investigation is done. Democrats are certainly going to continue to issue subpoenas, continue to push for more answers. The administration will continue to fight them. Where does this go, do you think?    KIRSTEN POWERS, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, it's pretty clear the administration is just trying to drag their feet on this, right? They want to drag things out for as listening as they possibly can. That's not an unusual response from administrations that are being investigated by Congress, but I think that a lot of the fury about this and Democrats really wanting an investigation above and beyond what you would normally see is because of how this has been handled.    I think that it's been handled so dishonestly by the attorney general by putting out this summary, and now pretending to be completely confused by the fact that people are upset when you actually get the report that it says something quite different than in fact Mueller had expressed that he didn't feel this was an accurate reflection, and he under oath didn't disclose that, and in fact misled people in another direction. And so, I think it's just -- it's just going to cause Democrats to get more and more fired up about this because they feel like they haven't gotten any answers.    COOPER: Elliot, though, I mean, can the president exert executive privilege over a private citizen, Don McGahn? Couldn't Don McGahn just say I'm going to go and testify?    ELLIOT WILLIAMS, FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL, OBAMA ADMINISTRATION: See, the complication here, and this is similar to what Robert was getting at is he is a private citizen, but you're talking about things that happened when he was White House counsel.    [20:15:06] But here is the thing. We're getting -- we're getting into this question of executive privilege that will be sorted out in the courts. And the much bigger issue is this is all indicative -- this is what Kirsten had said -- all indicative of an intent to frustrate the will of Congress and the frustrate congressional oversight. The president has said from the beginning, I'm going to instruct    people not to testify and not to comply with the subpoenas. Just in the last week, the House Oversight Committee saw witnesses not comply with subpoenas related to I believe the census and White House security clearance, and on and on and on. This extends across the administration.    So while Don McGahn is sort of the executive privilege du jour, what this really is an attempt to just not comply with what Congress -- and it's a different investigative body. It's not the special counsel.    COOPER: Yes, everyone, stay with us. I have to take a break. I want to get the group's take on the speaker of the house accusing the nation's top cop of breaking the law. Democrat Nancy Pelosi went there. The question is, where does that political fight go next?    I'll also get reaction from Capitol Hill from a member of the House Judiciary Committee, the same committee President Trump is likely blocking his White House counsel from testifying before.    Lots to discuss with Democratic Congressman Ted Lieu tonight.    (COMMERCIAL BREAK)    [20:20:22] COOPER: Our breaking news. President Trump says he will likely block former White House counsel Don McGahn from complying with the House Judiciary Committee subpoena to answer questions in front of its obstruction of justice probe.    Now, this hours after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi went on attack against America's top law enforcement official, saying this.    (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)    REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): He lied to Congress. He lied to Congress. If anybody else did that, it would be considered a crime. Nobody is above the law, not the president of the United States and not the attorney general.    (END VIDEO CLIP)    COOPER: As we mentioned earlier, as you might imagine, the Justice Department is pushing back and calls her comment false and reckless.    At issue is Barr's previous sworn testimony last month when he didn't know Robert Mueller's team supported the attorney general's summary of the Russia probe, despite the fact that Mueller did know what Mueller thought because Mueller sent a letter two weeks earlier expressing concern about how the attorney general handled that four-page memo.    In testimony yesterday, Barr was largely seen as evading when trying to explain that issue.    Back now with our guests.    Jeffrey, I mean, it is pretty incredible that the House speaker is accusing the chief law enforcement officer in the nation of a crime.    TOOBIN: It is unusual, but I think Barr's statement is very hard to defend. You know, both Congressman Crist and Senator Van Hollen asked him in pretty direct ways, were you aware that Mueller and his team were upset about how you characterized the Mueller report, and he said, no, he didn't know that they were upset. And, you know, we now know that there were two letters and a phone call which are extremely dramatic events.    Even Barr didn't claim that he forgot about these incidents. He claimed that the questions were not phrased in such a way to call for a answer of ""of course I'm aware."" But, boy, I think he is not going to be prosecuted because the justice department is not going to move against the attorney general, but the question of whether Barr told the truth, I think he's got a tough argument there.    COOPER: Elliot, what is interesting is Barr was saying while the question was imprecise and I didn't know what his staff felt, I had a conversation directly with Mueller, but the letter, which from all intents and purposes was written by Mueller, Barr then went on to say, well, his staff -- somebody on his staff probably wrote the letter. So by that logic, he did hear from the staff if that in fact was his confusion.    WILLIAMS: This is why lawyers put things in writing, so there is no ambiguity as to what was said. The special counsel, and I say the special counsel, not his staff, but the special counsel put out a letter expressing concerns. Now you can pin it on junior staff because you want to disagree with it, but the simple fact is it's in writing.    So, I agree wholeheartedly with Jeffrey's point. Either -- the attorney general has at minimum given inconsistent statements, and obviously at maximum lied under oath to Congress. This all invites the question or the fact that he needs to get up there and clarify it with Congress. You know, and work out some accommodation to his testimony.    You know, there has been this bickering over staff questioning which is actually a quite minor point in congressional oversight matters, get up there and testify, clarify the statements and then we can all move on. We could avoid a lot of this if the Justice Department -- but again, this gets back to what we were talking about in the last segment. It's all part of an attempt to frustrate Congress and not comply with these congressional oversight requests, and we're seeing it playing out here.    COOPER: Kirsten, do you think Speaker Pelosi and congressional Democrats are actually going to act on this?    POWERS: You know, I don't know what they're going to end up doing, but I think they have a very solid case here, and I think that, you know, any way you slice it, he was intentionally trying to mislead. He knew the question that was being asked. And even as you pointed out, even if you take it precisely as it was asked, he lied in response to it because he himself says he believes that the investigators wrote the letter and not Mueller.    So any way you slice it, he wasn't honest. And I think that that should be a bigger problem, frankly, than it is. I hear Republicans defending him, making up this ridiculous story about how he didn't know what they were talking about or he was confused, and it's just not plausible.    COOPER: Robert, do you think he lied? Do you think he wasn't honest?    RAY: I'd like to be fair, civil and clear here, but I think the argument that he lied is overwrought. I don't know why we've reached a point in this country that when someone doesn't like the answer to a question, the first place we run is to perjury and false statements.    [20:25:07] And, you know, look, on this one, would it have been better to have disclosed this? I'm sure with the benefit of hindsight, sure. But I will say on the question of whether it's false statements, lying to Congress or perjury, I really don't think that's the case.    I think one question to me was remember, if the question is, did you know whether or not bob Mueller objected to your summary of the conclusion, remember, a good part of the conclusion is the determination by the attorney general not to bring or to find that there was insufficient evidence of obstruction of justice. I think to this point -- I believe with regard to that question.    I think the attorney general still doesn't know whether or not Bob Mueller agrees with that conclusion.    COOPER: Do you think he was being completely truthful?    RAY: Well, look, I think you also -- Jeffrey selectively edited his response and left out the part, of course, where the attorney general, as he stated in his testimony yesterday, added that he suspected that what the objection was from Mueller's team was about the fact that they wanted a more fulsome disclosure, which is the only material fact that would be an issue here that would form the basis of lying to Congress because it would have to be material and also any argument that it was perjury.    So, I understand -- I understand --    COOPER: But would you characterize his testimony as fully clear, fully transparent?    RAY: Well, that isn't what y'all started with. You started with Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the United States House of Representatives --    COOPER: I'm asking you now, though.    RAY: -- saying that the attorney general of the United States was lying to Congress. The answer is no.    COOPER: But I've asked three times, do you think he was fully transparent? You haven't said yes. RAY: I would say that your oath is to tell the truth, the whole truth    and nothing but the truth. I think it would have been advisable and better had he disclosed the fact that he had a communication with the special counsel.    WILLIAMS: Anderson, if I may?    RAY: But, Anderson, that's not the same thing as saying --    COOPER: I understand, I understand.    RAY: -- that he was lying to Congress or he was misleading under the false statement statutes or that it was perjury. We've got stop that.    COOPER: Jeff, I want you to be able to respond, and then we've got to go.    TOOBIN: Well, I'm not sure. I didn't say it was a crime. You know, that's sort of an irrelevant issue. There is not going to be a prosecution here.    What I'm just saying is this was not honest testimony. If he had told the truth, it would have been a huge bombshell. It would have been enormous news that Mueller had objected.    That's why the only reason it seems to me he didn't tell the truth, because he wanted to avoid that disclosure, and that's why I think it's so unfortunate, and really bad that he didn't tell the truth in answer to those two questions earlier.    COOPER: OK. I got to --    RAY: I just don't happen to agree.    COOPER: I hear you. Thanks to everybody.    Jeff, tell that guy behind you who just teed off he should have used a 5 iron instead of a 3 iron. I don't know what a 5 iron or a 3 iron is. I don't play golf. I just decided to say that.    More on our breaking news ahead, yes, and maybe tell me one day what that actually means.    Plus, we'll talk to a congressman on the Judiciary Committee who says Barr is one of the most dangerous men in Washington, next.    (COMMERCIAL BREAK)    [20:31:53] ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR: We're following breaking news tonight. President Trump is saying he likely can't let former White House Counsel Don McGahn testify before the House Judiciary Committee as part of its obstruction of justice investigation.    Also House speaker, as we mentioned, Nancy Pelosi said Attorney General Barr committed a crime. She says he lied to Congress. The Justice Department calls that false. Congressman Ted Lieu, a member of the House Judiciary Committee has his own opinion on that matter. I spoke to him earlier.    (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)    COOPER: Congressman Lieu, first of all, Speaker Pelosi saying that Attorney General Barr lied to Congress and that's a crime. Do you agree with her?    REP. TED LIEU (D-CA): I do. I'm a former prosecutor, and it looks just like perjury. Basically, Barr was asked if Special Counsel Mueller's team had any concerns about his summary of the Mueller report, and he said no. And we know that that's a lie, because he got a letter from Bob Mueller saying essentially that he mischaracterized the Mueller report.    COOPER: Yes. So to the Justice Department's argument about why Barr wouldn't show up today, why couldn't judiciary committee members who are attorneys like yourself question Barr today instead of insisting on staff attorneys? What is the rationale for what because that is the thing that he used as a reason not to come?    LIEU: I think if we didn't have that reason, he would have picked another reason not to come. He actually didn't tell the Judiciary Committee until after his Senate hearing yesterday, which tells me that he realized it did not go well.    And certainly, we could have just members ask questions or we could ask staff counsel, but it's up to Congress to decide how we run our hearing, and this is nothing unusual. Last term I was in numerous judicial committee meetings where staff counsel questioned members of the Trump administration.    COOPER: What do you think of the likelihood of getting Barr to actually come in front of the committee is at this point?    LIEU: So Congress has the power to issue subpoenas. And if he is simply not going to show up in the Judiciary Committee, we will at some point issue a subpoena, and then we can enforce it.    He has right now violated a current subpoena for the unredacted Mueller report. That we're going to enforce next week with a contempt proceeding if he does not provide the full Mueller report in the next couple days.    COOPER: And a contempt proceeding, so if he is held in contempt of Congress, what -- does that really result in anything?    LIEU: Yes, it does. So here's the process. The House Judiciary Committee will vote in a contempt proceeding. If we hold him in contempt, it goes to the House floor. If the House floor votes in contempt, then it triggers two things.    First, it allows our House counsel to litigate in courts to try to enforce it. Second, the courts have already upheld Congress' inherent power to start taking actions against that individual without the courts. So we have procedures where we could in fact start levying fines on that person. In the past, they've even had a House jail. I don't think we're going go there, but at least we do have that power and the courts have upheld it.    COOPER: You've called the attorney general now one of the most dangerous men in Washington, which is -- I mean, is an extraordinary statement about any federal official, let alone the chief law enforcement officer in this country.    [20:35:06] LIEU: Two reasons I said that. One is not only did he mislead the American people, he was then given a letter from Robert Mueller saying he misled the American people, and he doubles down and lies to Congress and the American people after that. And second, right now he is suing to eliminate preexisting conditions to health care coverage for millions of Americans. He is a dangerous man.    COOPER: It does seem hard to believe when the attorney general yesterday, you know, said that the note was a little snippy and that it was probably just written by a staff member, the idea -- I mean, it's an extraordinary step for Mueller to have written this letter and sent it to Barr, and now it's public. The idea that he would have pawned that off on a staff member and not even looked at it or agreed with everything that's in it seems ludicrous on its face.    LIEU: Absolutely. It was definitely a snitty thing for Bill Barr to say and there's no way that a staff member wrote that. That was an extraordinary act. I'm sure Robert Mueller wrote that letter, and we hope Robert Mueller is going to come and we expect him to come later this month to testify before the House Judiciary Committee.    COOPER: Congressman Ted Lieu, I appreciate your time. Thank you.    LIEU: Thank you, Anderson.    (END VIDEOTAPE)    COOPER: There's a lot going on tonight. We have more breaking news. ""The New York Times"" is reporting the name of a government investigator who posed as a research assistant during the Trump campaign. Part of the FBI's counter intelligence efforts to better understand the campaign's links to Russia, in particular George Papadopoulos. That's who the focus of this investigator was. We'll have details on that next.    (COMMERCIAL BREAK)    [20:40:14] COOPER: ""The New York Times"" is reporting previously unknown details about the FBI's counterintelligence probe into the Trump campaign and its links to Russia, specifically, information about a woman who posed as a research assistant in order to meet with former campaign adviser George Papadopoulos. Sharing the byline is ""New York Times"" reporter Adam Goldman.    Adam, if you can, just walk us through this new details about what steps the FBI took to investigate George Papadopoulos. ADAM GOLDMAN, REPORTER, NEW YORK TIMES: Well, what we've learned is after Mr. Papadopoulos got this offer of cooperation from the Russians, in a sense, the FBI set about trying to figure out what he knew, and they wanted to do it secretly.    So they arranged a meeting in London with an informant, a professor named Stefan Halper, and a woman named Azra Turk, who was a government investigator that the FBI had sent to London to work with the informant.    And together they worked George to figure out what he might know or might not know. And they met with him separately and together and ultimately the operation in London in which the British knew about was not a success.    COOPER: And is it clear why the decision was made by the FBI to send this particular investigator to London?    GOLDMAN: This person would play the role of Stefan Halper's research assistant. And I thought the FBI believed she would make a good fit. I think part of the rationale was also to have an American investigator there who could provide some oversight and make sure this operation stayed on the rails.    COOPER: Was she an FBI agent?    GOLDMAN: I'm just going to leave it right now as a government investigator.    COOPER: OK.    GOLDMAN: I use that wording for a reason, and I'm going to leave it at that.    COOPER: OK. Is it -- and is it clear if any actual information was learned from that meeting? I mean, you said it was basically a failure.    GOLDMAN: Yes, it was -- basically it wasn't fruitful but, you know, what it showed was this, you know, some might say panic, others might say heightened sense of alarm about what was going on, and they needed to get to the bottom of it.    I mean, this was pretty extraordinary for the FBI to move this fast on something overseas, to run this type of operation. And it really goes to the seriousness of the threat, at least the threat they received.    COOPER: And yesterday Attorney General Barr defended -- he's used the term spying. How does that square with the fact that the FBI Russia investigation is now under investigation by the Justice Department?    GOLDMAN: You know, Attorney General Barr thinks this is a good English word. You know, obviously there was some in the law enforcement community who would object to the term ""spying."" They would prefer to say lawful surveillance. I mean either way, the FBI was running an informant and using another investigator to covertly or clandestinely, you know, acquire information.    COOPER: And the President's reelection campaign, as you know, is already arguing that this proves they were the victims of some corrupt probe. That's really not what you're reporting is?    GOLDMAN: No, no. That's not the point we were trying to make. Look, we as an organization, ""The New York Times,"" we've done some Seminole reporting on the origins of the investigation, how it started. And this is just a continuation of that reporting.    I think, you know, right now the only thing we know is this was a lawful law enforcement operation that took place in London with the knowledge of British intelligence. You know, unless that changes, you know, we're still working from the premise that this was lawful, and the FBI didn't, in fact -- it wasn't nefarious.    So, we'll -- you know, we've got see where this takes us. You know, Barr might come to a different conclusion down the road, but at this moment, nobody is providing any evidence that the FBI actually committed wrongdoing. They were simply being aggressive when it came to what they say is a lawful and predicated investigation, though an extraordinary one.    COOPER: Yes. Adam Goldman, thank you so much. Great reporting, appreciate it.    GOLDMAN: Thanks.    COOPER: Attorney General Barr's personal and professional relationship with Robert Mueller stretches back at least three decades, but has the letter from Mueller that Barr calls snitty changed the equation? That's next.    (COMMERCIAL BREAK)    [20:48:16] COOPER: The House Judiciary Committee says it would like Mueller to testify on May 15th about his nearly two-year-long investigation. Now, as monumental as that might be, there is no indication to date whether that testimony will in fact happen on that date, or at all.    For his part, Attorney General Barr made it clear yesterday he wasn't the least bit happy with the letter his long-time friend sent him about Barr's framing of the report.    (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)    WILLIAM BARR, ATTORNEY GENERAL: You know, the letter was a bit snitty and I think it was probably written by one of the staff people.    (END VIDEO CLIP)    COOPER: Well, whether or not that's accurate, the entirety of Barr's testimony as we've reported has come under attack, withering attack by Democrats in Congress and should Mueller one day publicly refute what Barr has said under oath, there would certainly be questions about what that might mean for the -- certainly the very least the old friendship between them.    Perspective now from Mueller biographer, Garrett Graff, author of ""The Threat Matrix: The FBI at War in the Age of Global Terror."" Garrett, I mean, you've read, I think you said the other night, pretty much everything Mueller has ever written or ever said. The idea that Barr is throwing out that this was probably written by some staffer, that -- I mean, does that seem possible at all to you?    GARRETT GRAFF, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I mean, it certainly probably technically true in that this was a document that was likely drafted by the staff, debated among the staff.    But, you know, the idea that Mueller didn't carefully go over every line of it that the staff probably debated with Mueller the exact wording, the exact phrasing, and I would actually guess the staff pushed for harsher wording than Mueller was actually comfortable with.    COOPER: The tension that appears to be playing out between these two people, between Barr and Mueller, is it surprising? I mean, you know, in his testimony, in his confirmation testimony, Barr said, you know, they'd been friends. They'll be friends after this. Do you think that's true?    [20:50:03] GRAFF: It's possible. The friendship to my understanding has always been strongest actually on the wives side, that Bill Barr's wife and Robert Mueller's wife spent time together in a bible study among other settings.    But, you know, remember -- you have to remember, and this has been I think part of what's been hard for the American people to understand in a lot of this, these elite circles of the Department of Justice are just incredibly small.    I mean, when you look back over the last 25 years, you've had the same relatively small set of people. Robert Mueller, Jim Comey, Bill Barr, Eric Holder, you know, rotate through these top jobs, Christopher Wray. And so these are very tight professional circles with the people who do have a deep professional respect for one another.    COOPER: What is their disagreement over the way the findings of the Mueller report were characterized say about how they see their roles as prosecutors and how they interpret the law?    GRAFF: Yes. And I think that this was where we're beginning to see a real split between Bob Mueller's personality and Bill Barr's personality. Mueller first and foremost is a Justice Department institutionalist. You know, he is not a political figure. He is not a partisan person. Whereas, Bill Barr has been a lawyer in the Department of Justice certainly for -- you know, repeatedly, but has always been more of a partisan figure than Mueller ever has.    And, you know, when you go back and you look at the Manuel Noriega prosecution, when you look at Iran-contra, when you look at, you know, Barr going out of his way to write that 19-page unsolicited memo for the Raskin's about the obstruction of justice case that Mueller was building, you know, these are just actions that you could never imagine Mueller himself actually doing. Barr has proven that he is a partisan figure more than he is a Justice Department figure.    COOPER: Do you think Mueller would want to testify?    GRAFF: I think that Mueller has never enjoyed congressional testimony in any job that he has ever had, but he will certainly -- he will certainly comply with any lawful order that he receives to testify.    COOPER: And the Office of the House Judiciary Committee, I mean, they fully intend to call him. It remains to be seen if and when that happens, if the DOJ tries to prevent him from speaking. Would it be feasible -- I mean Mueller is still under -- he still works at the Department of Justice, doesn't he?    GRAFF: He does until he decides that he doesn't. And presumably at some point in the forthcoming days, Mueller will decide his work as special counsel is wrapped up and he'll turn in his resignation and he'll go back to his golf game.    COOPER: Garrett Graff, appreciate it. Thanks very much. I want to check in with Chris to see what he's working on for ""Cuomo Prime Time."" Chris?    CHRIS CUOMO, CNN ANCHOR: I wonder what it means that he hasn't done that yet?    COOPER: Yes, it's interesting.    CUOMO: You know, I wonder why he's there, what he wants, what he thinks is important. That's going to be a big step. Now, paralleling and shadowing what he does is going to be what the Democrats do, right?    So we have Senator Amy Klobuchar on tonight. Obviously she is running for president, a senator who got to question Bill Barr yesterday. What does she think the Democrats should do next? Speaker Pelosi, obviously that's in the House, but heavy hit at A.G. Barr saying that he committed perjury.    COOPER: Yes.    CUOMO: What are they going to do about it?    COOPER: Yes.    CUOMO: That little stunt at the House today, what are they going to actually do? So we're going to go through that. And we're going to start looking at what was done to surveil the campaign. Will any of it wind up being called spying?    COOPER: Yes, definitely from the campaign is saying it is. Chris, I'll see you in about seven minutes from now.    President Trump said he would hire all of the best people. Remember that? Well, another one of those best people implodes or in Washington speaks removes himself from consideration. ""The Ridiculist"" is next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)    [20:56:19] COOPER: Time now for ""The Ridiculist"". And tonight it's another bleak milestone in the White House office of the best and brightest.    President Trump's intended nominee for the Federal Reserve Board, conservative pundit and self-distracting mansplainer, Stephen Moore, today withdrew his name from consideration, which is a Washington euphemism for his Senate confirmation was as likely as Sarah Sanders passing a polygraph test, or Sarah Sanders admitting she was wrong, or Sarah Sanders showing up for press briefing, it's still his choice.    Moore who full disclosure was formally a CNN Contributor and, yes, I know, slow clap for us on that one, today sent the President a letter that reads in part, ""The unrelenting attacks on my character have become untenable for me and my family and three more months of this would be too hard on us.""    In hindsight, probably wasn't a good sign to Senator Lindsey Graham, a White House ally who'd probably be willing to drive the get away golf cart after President Trump shot someone on Fifth Avenue said the other day that Moore's nomination would be ""problematic.""    Now, before you take out your clarinet to play a funeral (INAUDIBLE) for Stephen Moore's career prospects, consider that what he claims are attacks on his character are actual examples of reporters reading his past writings.    CNN's KFile recently uncovered articles that Moore wrote as an adult that were littered with sexism and degrading references to women. Moore said he was joking, but these weren't like high school mistakes, these weren't college year book idiocy. He was a full-grown adult writing in major magazines. You can go to cnn.com and hold your nose if you want to read the details.    For his part, the President tweeted today in part, ""Steve Moore, a great pro-growth economist and a truly fine person, has decided to withdraw from the Fed process."" Truly fine person, doesn't that kind of ring a bell? Oh, yes, Moore is a member of a very, very elite club, one of the very best the President promised he would hire.    (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)    DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We're going to make America great again. We're going to use our best people.    I'm going to get the best people.    We're going to deliver. We're going to get the best people in the world.    We don't want people that are B level, C level, D level. We have to get our absolute best.    We're going to use our smartest and our best. We're not using political hacks anymore.    It's a sophisticated chess match, but I have the best people lined up.    You need people that are truly, truly capable.    We have to get the best people.    (END VIDEO CLIP)    COOPER: That's true. Yes, the best people, sophisticated chess match. It seems like the President was missing a rook or two when he held the job fair because it's not just Stephen Moore, there's the President's other Fed favorite, ex-pizza kingpin and failed presidential candidate Herman Cain whose past sexual harassment allegations doomed his chances pretty much from the get go.    There was HHS Secretary Tom Price, loved private jets as much as he loved taxpayers funding them. There was also the Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, remember him, who apparently thought he was Queen Elizabeth because he ordered a special flag to be raised whenever he entered the building. Yes, smooth-skinned EPA administrator Scott Pruitt, he used his government security detail to seek out his preferred brand of lotion from the Ritz-Carlton.    The list goes on. Man, can you image being on that security detail? Mr. Pruitt wants some lotion from the concierge desk. That would be kind of demoralizing, I would think. Rob Porter accused of abuse. Michael Flynn lied to the FBI, but he was a good guy. Sean Spicer, cartoonish disaster and a liar verified in the Mueller report. Oh, Scaramucci. I mean, look, how much time have we got because we could go on?    The irony is as thick as swamp water. The President and his allies fuel conspiracy theories about career government workers, you know, people who have dedicated entire careers working behind the scenes, not talking about it on T.V., not being pundits, actual people who become actual experts in their sometimes very obscure but important fields working for the government, those people are hacks.    According to the President and Alex Jones, they're deep state, which is why it's a good thing there are so many jobs in various agencies that have gone unfilled. Don't worry about it. Sleep well at night knowing only the best and brightest are at work in the White House and on ""The Ridiculist"".    Well, the news continues. I want to hand it over to Chris for ""Cuomo Prime Time."" Chris?    CUOMO: Very serious show, but I have to do it. Name the movie, ""It puts the lotion in the basket.""    COOPER: Oh, come on, ""Silence of the Lambs.""    CUOMO: There it is my man, my man. All right, Anderson, thank you very much. I'm Chris Cuomo. Welcome to ""Prime Time.""",Transcripts,true

27,3297100985334601748390533387428469265,"(CNN) For the first time on record, precipitation on Saturday at the summit of Greenland — roughly two miles above sea level — fell as rain and not snow.  Temperatures at the Greenland summit over the weekend rose above freezing for the third time in less than a decade. The warm air fueled an extreme rain event that dumped 7 billion tons of water on the ice sheet, enough to fill the Reflecting Pool at the National Mall in Washington, DC, nearly 250,000 times.  It was the heaviest rainfall on the ice sheet since record keeping began in 1950, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center , and the amount of ice mass lost on Sunday was seven times higher than the daily average for this time of year.  Ted Scambos, a senior research scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado, said this is evidence Greenland is warming rapidly.  ""What is going on is not simply a warm decade or two in a wandering climate pattern,"" Scambos told CNN. ""This is unprecedented.""

It's a seasonal cycle based on timing and temperature, two variables that climate change is pushing increasingly out of sync.  To the outsider, it can be hard to see: Plants still grow, flowers bud, bears awake, and marmots breed. Broad-tailed hummingbirds still trill around a landscape that evokes the opening scene of The Sound of Music, with flowery meadows and granite peaks.  But those who know this ecosystem will tell you something is a little off. The flowers are blooming earlier. The marmots are mating in early May. Spring is springing sooner across the Northern Hemisphere, changing natural cycles around the world.  In Alaska, brown bears are changing their feeding habits to eat elderberries that ripen earlier.  In California, birds are nesting and breeding a week earlier than they did a century ago.  ""One of the consequences of climate change is that even though everything is happening earlier, they're not changing at the same rate,"" says David Inouye, an ecologist from the University of Maryland who has spent more than 40 years documenting the change in Colorado's alpine meadows.  toggle caption Nathan Rott/NPR  The results can be seen all around him. Flowers are blooming before there are bees to pollinate them. Hard frosts are still occurring long after winter's snow melts away, decimating fruit orchards and budding plants. Allergy season is getting longer.  Inouye says that when he started spending his summers at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory in Gothic, Colo., cataloging flowers in the thin mountain air, climate change wasn't really a thing people were talking about. But as time went on, the evidence of it started to become unavoidable.  ""Temperatures are getting warmer here,"" he says. ""The April low temperatures here are now about 6 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than they used to be.""  Some plants and wildlife, taking their thermal cue, have been able to adapt in kind. Some are thriving. Others are being left behind.  toggle caption Nathan Rott/NPR  Fewer flowers, fewer worker bees  Colorado's snowpack this year was the worst it had been in more than 30 years. Temperatures in early spring soared.  Many researchers here view this as a glimpse of things to come.  ""You can see it visually,"" says Rebecca Irwin, an ecologist from North Carolina State University. ""We have less flowers.""  Fewer flowers means less food for the native bees that buzz around in meadows like the one Irwin stands in.  She and two others are equipped with wispy butterfly nets and fanny packs filled with plastic vials.  They're hoping to get an idea of how different bees are doing in this environment by catching as many of them as they can over the course of an hour. It is a task that proves easy.  toggle caption Nathan Rott/NPR  With lunges and hops, they catch sweat bees and leafcutter bees, queens and workers.  At the end of the time period, it's clear that they caught far fewer worker bees than they would have in a normal year.  ""It's hard to know if they're just delayed or if they're not doing well because there's no food for them,"" Irwin says.  Some bees, Irwin says, seem to be doing fine. In years like this, they're able to emerge earlier to meet the early bloom.  ""But some of them are constrained by how long it takes them to develop,"" she says.  The fear is that those bees and the flowers that depend on them for pollination could slowly get pushed out.  Michael Stemkovski of North Carolina State says documenting these changes can be disheartening. ""It's kind of like watching an illness progress without having the tools to remedy it.""  toggle caption Nathan Rott/NPR  We may not like the climate change winners  The ability of a species to adapt to its circumstances — to roll with the environmental punches, so to speak — is called plasticity.  Species that have a lot of plasticity tend to be generalists. They're able to make the situation work. Species with less plasticity, those that depend on a specific ecosystem or climate, are more likely to struggle.  ""When you think of a plant that can't move over its lifetime, it either tolerates a dry area or it doesn't,"" says Dan Blumstein, a conservation biologist from the University of California, Los Angeles. He specializes in marmots, a large ground squirrel that is, in Blumstein's words, ""remarkably plastic.""  ""Marmots are all about getting obese,"" Blumstein says. ""They adjust their annual schedule appropriately to be active when the vegetation is growing.""  toggle caption Nathan Rott/NPR  An earlier spring means a longer growing season, so they have more time to gather food. As a result, Blumstein says, marmots seem to be getting bigger. He stops short of calling them a ""climate change winner"" though, noting that a longer growing season also means more chances for them to be killed by predators.  Other species are emerging as winners though, including ""some that people might not be very fond of,"" says Jill Anderson, a geneticist at the University of Georgia.  She points to poison ivy, which is expected to thrive with more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.  Researchers at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory also report seeing far more ticks this summer than in any previous year. That report is consistent with studies showing that the range for ticks is increasing with a warming climate.  And there is a lot of evidence that climate change is diminishing biodiversity, which can be seen in these alpine meadows as well.  toggle caption Nathan Rott/NPR  A glimpse of the future  Just off a ridge, in a verdant meadow, John Harte, an ecologist from the University of California, Berkeley, has created a window into the future of this place. It's a grim one.  ""When I tell people what to expect, I say, 'Well, imagine the opening scene of The Sound of Music was filmed outside of Reno, Nevada,' "" he says. ""Because that's what it's going to be.""  Twenty eight years ago, Harte suspended a series of heat lamps in long, humming rows, a few feet off the ground. The lamps, which were designed for chicken farmers in Pennsylvania, raise the temperature on the ground by about 4 to 5 degrees.  toggle caption Nathan Rott/NPR  ""That's comparable to the climate we expect by the year 2050,"" he says.  The heat lamps have been on since then, day and night, and the change that is occurring beneath them is remarkable.  The yellow and purple flowers that dot the landscape nearby are mostly gone. In their place is sagebrush, a prolific plant that you would usually see at lower elevations.  ""We are projecting that all of these meadows are going to look like that,"" Harte says, pointing to the gnarled plant. ""We are homogenizing the planet.""  There's another concern, just as great. Harte and his colleagues have found that the heated soil holds far less carbon than the native ground. That missing carbon, he says, is going into the air, creating the potential for a feedback process that will accelerate climate change further.  ""Ecosystems affect climate just as much as climate affects ecosystems,"" he says. ""And the changes happen quick.""","Spring Is Springing Sooner, Throwing Nature's Rhythms Out Of Whack",true
29,150901752055902164703765577887183709014,"Written by James Edward Kamis on Aug 7, 2018 . Posted in Latest news  In what amounts to dissension from National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) climate change policy, a series of just-released studies by working-level scientists prove that geological and not atmospheric forces are responsible for melting of Earth’s polar ice sheets.  A review of these studies and their significance relative to what force or forces control the climate and climate-related events of Earth’s polar regions is as follows.  NASA Antarctica Study October 30, 2015  This research study authored by NASA Glaciologist Jay Zwally concluded that Antarctica is gaining, not losing, ice mass and thereby challenging the conclusions of many previous studies, most importantly the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) 2013 report (see the quote from the study below).  “A new NASA study says that an increase in Antarctic snow accumulation that began 10,000 years ago is currently adding enough ice to the continent to outweigh the increased losses from its thinning glaciers.  “The research challenges the conclusions of other studies, including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) 2013 report, which says that Antarctica is overall losing land ice.  The conclusions of this NASA study were immediately challenged by numerous climate activist groups and biased media outlets (see here). These challenges have since been proven incorrect for several reasons.  Statements by NASA Glaciologist Jay Zwally concerning his soon-to-be-published Antarctic follow-up study reconfirm that Antarctica is gaining, not losing ice.  The results of this follow-up study are bolstered by two other NASA research studies.  The first, dated January 1, 2018, shows that East Antarctica has for many years been accumulating huge amounts of snow that compact into ice and increasing overall ice mass (see here).  The second NASA study released on July 19, 2018, showed that the atmosphere above the Antarctic Continent has been continuously cooling and not warming for many years (see here).  Obviously, it’s impossible to melt Antarctica’s glaciers via atmospheric warming when the atmosphere is not warming.  Lastly, a NASA study dated Feb. 20, 2018, concludes that outflow of East Antarctic glaciers into the ocean is stable and not increasing (see here). This is proof that East Antarctica’s ice mass is not being diminished by glacial outflow into adjacent oceans.  Bottom line, research by NASA scientists clearly shows that the well-documented ice loss in West Antarctica is more than accommodated by ice gains in East Antarctica. Contrary to hundreds of pro-melting articles, Antarctica’s ice mass is increasing!  NASA Antarctica Study November 7, 2017  This research study entitled “Hot News from the Antarctic Underground“ investigated West Antarctica’s subglacial geology.  It substantiates many previous research studies that have documented this region’s subglacial high-bedrock heat-flow, active faulting, and prevalent volcanism.  Recent research by the University of Rhode Island scientists confirms the premises of a previous Climate Change Dispatch article that subglacial, volcanic heat-flow is melting West Antarctica’s Pine Island Glacier (see here).  Many previous Climate Change Dispatch articles have reviewed West Antarctica’s subglacial mantle plume and the world-class fault system that is acting to bottom-melt this region’s glacial land sea ice (see here, here, and here).  NASA Greenland Study August 1, 2018  The results of this research study illustrated in Figure 2 confirm the very high geothermal bedrock heat-flow from Greenland’s massive subglacial Mantle Plume, which was originally documented in four previous research studies (see here, here, here, and here).  A geothermal heat-flow cause for the melting of Greenland’s ice sheet has been the focus of numerous Climate Change Dispatch articles (see here, here, here, and here).  In summary, the NASA studies mentioned in this article have accelerated the ongoing demise of the once one-hundred-percent-settled-science status of global warming theory.  It is now abundantly clear that even respected mainstream NASA geologists and glaciologists are advocating that formerly underappreciated geological forces working in concert with atmospheric forces are responsible for polar ice cap melting.  Here we note that in many cases these geological forces are dominant and, in some cases, the complete cause of modern-day and ancient polar ice cap melting  Knowing this brings into question other aspects of supposedly 100 percent settled climate dogma.  Specifically, that man-made global warming is the root cause of other supposedly unnatural polar ice cap events such as alteration of marine and land animal migration patterns, anomalous plankton blooms, chemical alteration of adjacent ocean waters, alteration of polar area ocean currents, and changes in meteorological patterns.  Many of these events are more likely the result of, or strongly influenced by, geologically induced heat and chemically charged heated fluid flow at the base of polar ice sheets or in adjacent oceans.  Lastly, there is a quiet revolution occurring within NASA that will play out within the next year or two ending in the complete reconstruction of global warming theory.  The remodeled version will reflect the now proven and significant climate influence of geological forces as per the 2014 Plate Climatology Theory.

(Paul Ellis/AFP via Getty Images)  Study Finds Sun—Not CO2—May Be Behind Global Warming  New peer-reviewed paper finds evidence of systemic bias in UN IPCC's data selection to support climate-change narrative  The sun and not human emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) may be the main cause of warmer temperatures in recent decades, according to a new study with findings that sharply contradict the conclusions of the United Nations (UN) Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).  The peer-reviewed paper, produced by a team of almost two dozen scientists from around the world, concluded that previous studies did not adequately consider the role of solar energy in explaining increased temperatures.  The new study was released just as the UN released its sixth “Assessment Report,” known as AR6, that once again argued in favor of the view that man-kind’s emissions of CO2 were to blame for global warming. The report said human responsibility was “unequivocal.”  But the new study casts serious doubt on the hypothesis.  Calling the blaming of CO2 by the IPCC “premature,” the climate scientists and solar physicists argued in the new paper that the UN IPCC’s conclusions blaming human emissions were based on “narrow and incomplete data about the Sun’s total irradiance.”  Indeed, the global climate body appears to display deliberate and systemic bias in what views, studies, and data are included in its influential reports, multiple authors told The Epoch Times in a series of phone and video interviews.  “Depending on which published data and studies you use, you can show that all of the warming is caused by the sun, but the IPCC uses a different data set to come up with the opposite conclusion,” lead study author Ronan Connolly, Ph.D. told The Epoch Times in a video interview.  “In their insistence on forcing a so-called scientific consensus, the IPCC seems to have decided to consider only those data sets and studies that support their chosen narrative,” he added.  The implications, from a policy perspective, are enormous, especially in this field where trillions of dollars are at stake and a dramatic re-organization of the global economy is being proposed.

CO2  Using publicly available data sets from the U.S. government and other sources, it is easy to explain all of the warming observed in recent decades using nothing but changes in solar energy arriving on Earth, according to the new paper.  Indeed, while it agrees that using the data sets chosen by the UN would imply humans are largely to blame, the study includes multiples graphs showing that simply choosing different data sets not used by the UN upends the IPCC’s conclusion.  If confirmed, the study, published in the international scientific journal Research in Astronomy and Astrophysics (RAA) by experts from over a dozen countries, would represent a devastating blow to the UN IPCC and its conclusion that man’s emissions of CO2 are the sole or even primary driver of warming.  While the paper calls for further research to resolve differences between conflicting data sets and studies, the authors show conclusively that, depending on the data sets being used, it is entirely possible that most or even all of the warming has nothing to do with man.  Using 16 different estimates on the amount of solar energy, dubbed “Total Solar Irradiance,” the review compares that data with over 25 estimates of temperatures in the Northern hemisphere stretching back to the 1800s.  When solar data from NASA’s “ACRIM” sun-monitoring satellites are compared to reliable temperature data, for example, virtually all of the warming would be explained by the sun, with almost no role at all for human emissions.  And yet, for reasons that the study authors say are murky at best, the UN chooses to ignore the NASA ACRIM data and other data sets in favor of those that support the hypothesis of human responsibility for climate change.  The UN IPCC reports, including the recently released 6th Assessment Report, have consistently blamed human activities such as the emission of so-called “greenhouse gases” for the observed changes. Many studies in the scientific literature have agreed with the UN IPCC position.  However, the new study, titled “How much has the Sun influenced Northern Hemisphere temperature trends? An ongoing debate,” cites dozens of other studies that have pointed to the sun—not human activity—as the primary driver of climate changes.  According to the study authors, these dissenting scientific views have been deliberately suppressed by the IPCC and have not been reflected in the UN IPCC reports, for reasons that have not been adequately explained.  A spokesman for the IPCC denied wrongdoing by the UN body in comments to The Epoch Times and said the new study had been accepted for publication after the deadline for consideration.  The paper in RAA agrees that the planet has warmed somewhat since the late 19th century, when reliable data collection began in the northern hemisphere.  However, in another challenge to the UN’s influential report, even the temperature data sets used by the IPCC are subjected to criticism in the new paper and others.  Among other concerns, the study highlighted apparent flaws in the approach used by the IPCC for estimating global temperature changes using data from both urban and rural locations.  According to the study’s authors, including urban data sets results in an artificial upward skewing of temperatures due to the well-known “urban heat island” effect that must be taken into account.  Basically, cities tend to be warmer than the countryside due to human activity and structures, so temperature stations that had cities grow up around them will show artificial temperature increases caused by the urbanization rather than global warming.  The IPCC has rejected those concerns, arguing that urbanization only played a very minor role in the estimate temperature increase.  Ronan Connolly, Ph.D. (courtesy Ronan Connolly)  Why the Apparent Bias?  Asked why these views have been ignored and even suppressed, lead study author Connolly suggested “confirmation bias” was at work. This is when individuals only consider information that supports their bias, something Connolly said affects all scientists.  While this may be at work in the IPCC’s selection of data sets and studies to consider and include, it is hard to know for sure, he said, expressing concern that the UN IPCC was only considering data sets and studies that “support the chosen narrative.”  “Whether they were deliberately doing it or whether it was simply confirmation bias is difficult to say, but it is clear that data sets are being selected that support the IPCC view while data contradicting it have been excluded,” added Connolly, who has a doctorate in Computational Chemistry and is affiliated with the Center for Environmental Research and Earth Sciences (CERES).  Connolly also said that the IPCC ignored key recent papers contradicting its conclusions, even denying that any such new papers existed despite leading IPCC scientists having cited those same papers in their own work.  For instance, a related 2015 paper published in the prestigious Earth-Science Reviews journal titled “Re-evaluating the role of solar variability on Northern Hemisphere temperature trends since the 19th century” was cited favorably by IPCC Working Group 1 Co-Chair Panmao Zhai of China. That paper argued, among other points, that the urban heat effect is not being properly addressed.  And yet, in the latest IPCC Assessment Report, the UN body claims that “No recent literature has emerged” that would cause an altering of its conclusion that the urbanization issue explains less than 10 percent of the apparent rise in global land temperatures.  Asked why the 2015 study in a major journal cited by one of its own leaders, among other key papers, was not mentioned in its latest report, a spokesman for the IPCC told The Epoch Times after consulting with IPCC Working Group 1 Co-Chair Panmao that “decisions on citations are up to the chapter team authors not the co-chairs.”  A spokesman for the UN body told The Epoch Times that he asked Panmao for an answer but that any potential response would not likely be forthcoming prior to publication.  In another case, the IPCC misrepresented a 2019 study that Connolly was involved in on snow cover, falsely implying that it showed less snow in all four seasons. In reality, the study showed more snow cover in fall and winter and that current climate models get all four seasons wrong.  Part of the problem is that the IPCC is mandated to find a scientific consensus, according to Connolly.  “This may have seemed like a good idea at the beginning, but where the scientific community has dissenting opinions, trying to force a premature consensus unfortunately hinders scientific progress—it is unhelpful and leads to an unjustified confidence in the conclusions,” Connolly told The Epoch Times in an interview.  Attempting to explain the absence of various published scientific viewpoints in the UN’s reports, the study cited researchers and papers to suggest that “scientific results that might potentially interfere with political goals are unwelcome.”  In this handout from NASA, a solar eruption rises above the surface of the sun in space on Dec. 31, 2012. (NASA/SDO via Getty Images)  Systemic Bias … or Deliberate Fraud?  Another study author, Willie Soon, Ph.D. echoed those concerns and argued that ignoring the sun’s activity is the equivalent of ignoring the elephant in the room.  Blasting the IPCC as “cartoon science rather than science,” the astrophysicist from CERES essentially accuses the UN body of deliberate fraud.  “I think the latest IPCC report will continue to mislead most of the unsuspecting public on how their works will be a fair and objective review of all relevant scientific works published over the past 8 years,” he told The Epoch Times in one of a series of interviews on the subject.  Soon, who has been researching the relationship between the sun and the Earth’s climate at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics for three decades, blasted the IPCC’s “Summary For Policymakers” (SPM) as well.  “It is no wonder that the draft SPM report has sold everyone yet another blatant untruth, that it is all about the CO2 that has driven all the temperature change on Earth, while they continue to hide the fact that our new and comprehensive research paper concludes that all these conclusions are not only premature but factually misleading and confusing,” he said.  “Our scientific review shows that the changes in the Sun’s irradiance are a plausible and important factor that can explain most of the observed changes in the thermometer data,” added Soon. “So now why is IPCC still playing this childish hide-and-seek game while thinking that we can all be permanently hoodwinked by their one-trick agenda?”  Soon said he hopes the systematic review of the relationship between the sun and the climate can help the scientific community return to a “more realistic approach” to understanding changes in the planet’s climate systems.  “It is time for this abuse of science by the IPCC to be stopped,” he concluded.  Incidentally, Soon believes global temperatures may decline in the coming decades, also due to changes in solar activity.

Study co-author Professor László Szarka, a geophysicist and member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, told The Epoch Times that the new review represented a “crucial milestone” in restoring the scientific definition of “climate change.”  Asserting that the definition has become distorted over the last 30 years, Szarka argued that the scientific community must remember that science is not based on authority or consensus, but on the pursuit of truth.  “The definition of climate change was distorted in 1992 in a way that is incompatible with science,” the geophysicist explained, pointing to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and its exclusion of natural causes from the definition of climate change.  In reality, the term climate change used to—and must again—include not just changes wrought by man, but also natural changes in temperature, rainfall, wind patterns, and other factors that occur over decades or longer time periods.  “The obscuration of the classical definition of climate change has paved the way for any change in the climate to be attributed and accounted to anthropogenic emission,” Szarka explained to The Epoch Times in highlighting the significance of the study.  But it does not have to be that way. He suggested that even non-scientist laymen could and should work to discover the truth.  “Regular people are able to decide who is fishing in troubled waters, if they systematically ask politicians, decision makers, and journalists what they mean by the term climate change,” he said.

Clary/AFP via Getty Images)  Outside Opinions  Even some UN IPCC reviewers have expressed skepticism of the dominant narrative and support for the work of Soon and others.  When contacted by The Epoch Times, accredited UN IPCC reviewer Howard Brady, Ph.D. of Australia praised the work of Soon and other authors behind the study as “probably the best around.”  Acknowledging a lack of expertise regarding the sun specifically, Brady slammed the IPCC and its models.  Among other concerns, he noted that they “still predict more storms even though they are declining,” and “they still report accelerating sea level [rise] when that does not exist.”  Over the years, numerous IPCC scientists have dissented from the views advanced by their colleagues.  For instance, the late Dr. Nils-Axel Morner, who served as an IPCC reviewer on sea-level, frequently accused the UN body of getting it wrong—most likely for political rather than scientific reasons.  Another outside expert contacted by The Epoch Times for insight into the new study and the latest IPCC report also expressed major concerns.  Alabama State Climatologist John Christy, distinguished professor of Atmospheric and Earth Sciences at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, noted that “the IPCC report indicates high confidence in model simulations while at the same time noting in the main body of the report how the models poorly represent the real atmosphere.”  The IPCC claims its models accurately portray the impact of all the forces that affect the climate and that nothing else could have caused the warming over the last 40 years except human emissions, he explained.  “This indicates a bit of hubris and lack of imagination,” said Christy, who also serves as the director of the Earth System Science Center.  Acknowledging that he had not had time to read the new paper or carefully review the latest IPCC report, the world-renowned climatologist told The Epoch Times that the UN’s models cannot even reproduce the natural variations of the last 150 years, such as the natural warming during the first half of the 20th century.  “They also overdo the warming of the last 40 years, again, not matching the real world,” he said.  “So, if they can’t reproduce natural variations with sufficient skill and they overheat the atmosphere over the last 40 years, how are they then endowed with the ability to tell us ‘why’ changes are happening with such ‘unequivocal’ confidence?” he asked.  Dr. Christy was blunt in his conclusions, saying “the models certainly don’t agree with each other regarding the future.”  That limits their results “to the realm of speculative hypotheses, not policy-determining tools.”  Willie Soon, Ph.D. speaks at the 39th annual meeting of the Doctors for Disaster Preparedness in Tucson, Ariz. on July 31, 2021. (Courtesy of Willie Soon)  Response from NASA and IPCC  When contacted about the new paper, Gavin Schmidt, who serves as acting senior advisor on climate at NASA and the director of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, was also blunt.  “This is total nonsense that no one sensible should waste any time on,” he told The Epoch Times.  He did not respond to a follow-up request for specific errors of fact or reasoning in the new RAA paper.  However, even Schmidt, a leading proponent of the man-made warming hypothesis, has conceded that the IPCC’s models have been inaccurate.  “You end up with numbers for even the near-term that are insanely scary—and wrong,” Schmidt was quoted as saying by the journal Science.  By contrast, IPCC Communications chief Jonathan Lynn told The Epoch Times that the UN body remained very confident in its conclusions.  Asked about the new paper and its authors’ assertions that the IPCC was inaccurately blaming human emissions, Lynn responded: “The IPCC doesn’t seek to blame anyone or anything for anything. We do try to attribute climate change to explain its causes.”  Pointing to Chapter 3 of the new IPCC report, Lynn echoed the UN body’s assessment that the more than 14,000 papers it examined demonstrate that warming has been driven by human emissions.  “The new 2021 paper may well challenge the underlying IPCC conclusion that CO2 and human emissions are behind the warming of recent decades,” Lynn added in a follow-up statement to The Epoch Times. “But if it is included in the next assessment, it’s unlikely to completely overturn that conclusion which is based on thousands of other pieces of research.”  The next IPCC assessment is expected more than five years from now.  One of the authors of the new IPCC report, Jim Kossin, celebrated that people were “starting to get scared” about climate changes due to the body’s findings.  “I think that’ll help to change people’s attitudes,” he said. “And hopefully that’ll affect the way they vote.”  On the hottest day of the year a couple enjoy the sunshine on Brighton Palace Pier in Brighton, England on July 23, 2019.

31,201914460179975751683603402664338251598,"by David Mason-Jones  Come November and December this year (2021) it will be exactly 150 years since a scientific expedition made meticulous observations of water temperatures along the Great Barrier Reef.  On the voyage from Sydney to Cape Sidmouth in far north Queensland scientists took hourly sea surface temperatures between 6:00am and 6:00pm every day ‘of the warm current setting south along the east coast of Australia’ now known as East Australian Current. The measurements commenced out to sea from Port Stevens, north of Sydney, and continued to near the tip of Cape York. They did the same on the return trip 2-weeks later.  Headed by government astronomers from Melbourne and Sydney, the voyage was organised by the Royal Society of Victoria to observe a total eclipse of the sun predicted for the 12th December, 1871. With other scientists the party travelled aboard the steamer Governor Blackall out of Sydney on 27 November 1871.. Consequently, the measurements were not just a matter of idle curiosity by passing mariners, they were the subject of formal scientific research and followed the same protocol and used the same thermometer for every observation.  Published in 1877 by Henry Chamberlain Russell, the 1871 data is the earliest consistently collected sea surface temperature dataset around the Australian coast.  Russell’s data established a baseline against which current sea surface temperatures can be compared. The comparison renders Null the commonly accepted hypothesis of rising sea surface temperatures in the Great Barrier Reef.  If the sea surface temperature of the Great Barrier Reef has been trending upwards – and if this trend could be characterised as ‘rapid’ – then a 150-year comparison should be sufficient to confirm it. The problem is that it establishes no such thing. When compared with today’s readings, it shows no upward trend.  The main finding of the recent research Report will come as anathema to multiple research bodies. The Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) and organisations like CSIRO, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, Great Barrier Reef Foundation, WWF and the Climate Council have consistently claimed survival of the Reef is imperilled by rising sea levels and sea surface temperatures.  The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority states that, ‘sea surface temperatures in the Australian region have warmed by around 1°C since 1910, with the Great Barrier Reef warming by 0.8°C in the same period.’  The main findings of the research were:  Firstly, compared at the same times of the year (November and December), there is no difference in average sea surface temperature over the last 150 years. That is a long time and it shows that temperatures are homeostatic, that is, self-regulating.  Secondly, during the warmest time of the year (from December to March) the monsoonal water cycle acts a self-regulating heat pump that maintains average sea surface temperature between 29 and 30degC. If the water entering the Reef Lagoon cannot warm, neither can the North Queensland or East Australian Currents. There is no evidence that the process has broken-down or is likely to do so in the future.  Operation of the heat pump closely regulates sea surface temperature between 27degC and 29degC but less than 30degC for up to five months and more than 20degC during winter (July to September). Low water temperature in winter sets the southern limit for Reef ecosystems, not high water temperatures in summer, which rarely (and only briefly) exceed 31degC.  Scientist, Dr. Bill Johnston, located the 1877 paper when undertaking research in The National Library on H.C. Russell’s contribution to meteorology in Australia. The former New South Wales senior research scientist has collated the 1871 data analysed it meticulously and correlated the temperature readings with the latitude at which they were taken. This is vital because the warm East Australian Current slowly cools as it flows south from the tropics, eventually into the Tasman Sea.  The 1871 observations were used to baseline recent data derived from 27 Australian Institute of Marine science (AIMS) data loggers from Thursday Island in the north to Boult Reef in the south. Both datasets were robust, comparable and fit for the purpose of examining time-evolution of sea surface temperature. AIMS data for equivalent times and latitudes were not significantly different to data measured in November/December 1871. It is shocking that this vital piece of scientific evidence is not featured more prominently in all the Reef research of recent years.  The result of this analysis surely dismantles the assertion that sea surface temperatures in the Great Barrier Reef are rising and rising rapidly.  The results have now been published in full detail on an Australian website BoMwatch – a site devoted to keeping an eye on Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology. The dataset with calculations is provided separately as a supplement to the report on the Bomwatch website.  Dr. Johnston’s detailed Report can be accessed at http://www.bomwatch.com.au . The full Report with tables of data is at http://www.bomwatch.com.au/bureau-of-meterology/trends-in-sea-surface-temperature-at-townsville-great-barrier-reef/ The researcher and publisher at BoMwatch want to make this a completely open field for science investigation.  In his final conclusion, Dr. Johnston states, ‘No difference was found between temperatures measured at Port Stephens and Cape Sidmouth by astronomers from Melbourne and Sydney using bucket samples in November and December 1871 and data sampled at those times from 27 AIMS datasets spanning from Thursday Island, in the north to Boult Reef in the south. Alarming claims that the East Australian Current has warmed due to global warming are therefore without foundation.’  Reference: Lomb, Nick (2016) Australian solar eclipse expeditions: the voyage to Cape York in 1871.

Governor Wike declared the stance of the State government on such calls when the Minister of State for Education, Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba, paid him a courtesy visit at Government House, Port Harcourt, yesterday.  He said the counterpart funding arrangement avails state governments the opportunity to show commitment in the provision of good educational foundation for children in their states.  Governor Wike said: “Here in this state, from the records that I have, there are over 100,000 out-of-school children. But they have been able to bring back 36 thousand to the classrooms. This is commendable.  “We have also accessed our counterpart funds from UBEC up to 2019. We are preparing to access 2020 funds. If you believe in the education of your people, then, as a government you must play a very prominent role.  “I’m not one of those governors, who will say that the federal government should scrap the counterpart funding. I hear, the Chairman of Governors Forum said so; but, I don’t agree to that. Every state must be committed.  “You cannot say you want to depend on federal government money alone, no.

Governor Wike stated that his administration understood the place of education in development, which was why not less than 30 percent was allocated to the sector.  He disclosed: “For us, education is basic. We can’t get it right until we focus on education. It’s unfortunate that the kind of budget I see for education in this country is terrible.  “When I see budget for Defence and others, and that of education that is either 2, 3, 7, or 10 percent of the budget and I know that doesn’t make sense.  “If you cannot put money in education and health, then, you can’t get it right. You don’t need to manage with education. It is one sector that government must understand that for any country to be developed, then, education is key.  “In this state, we have never given education less than 30 percent of our budget. Education and health are key. So, the federal government should try as much as they can to see that more funding is given to education”.  Speaking further, Governor Wike commended the Minister of State for Education and his Senior Minister for driving the programmes of the ministry apolitically.  Governor Wike noted that it was obvious that political consideration was not used to decide on Rivers State to be the first place to launch the “Better Education Service Delivery for All Programme for Result”, among other states in the zone.  Minister of State for Education, Nwajiuba, said they were in the state for the official launch of “Better Education Service Delivery for All Programme for Result”.

Ali said it is worrisome that smuggling often happened in border communities where most of the residents had no feel of governance and therefore had no allegiance to the Nigerian government.  He said that those residents would rather be loyal to smugglers because of the lack of government presence in the border communities.

On recruitment into the NCS, the CG said the service had not recruited in the past 17 years, adding that recruitment into the service was the prerogative of the president.  He said the NCS needs to recruit officers as there is a gap in terms of officers currently in the service.  “There will come a time that there will be no junior officers again in NCS; we need more officers and this is why we embarked on the recruitment of 3,200 officers for which we have so far spent N40 million,” he said.","Customs: We can’t effectively police the borders with 15,000 officers",mixture

He urged Buhari to equally turn NYSC camps into security training grounds to recruit the “able” graduates to join the military in order to curtail the insecurity in the country caused by Boko Haram terrorists, others.  According to NewsWirengr, Fayemi, who is also the Chairman of Nigeria Governors' Forum, at an event, said, “With this, we can use the existing orientation camps to train able graduates to reflate the security personnel under a special arrangement that will be worked out.  “That way, the fund that is currently deployed to the NYSC can be used with just some additional funding, which could be sourced through a national emergency fund for the next five to 10 years.  “Those who refuse to join the military services will have to serve in their community without pay.”  Fayemi explained that the step was necessary and a cheaper way to get 200,000 security personnel needed by Nigeria to tackle its worsening insecurity.  “By available statistics, we need a minimum of 200,000 personnel to boost the fighting power of our men,” stated the Ekiti governor.  “This number is very large and a potential financial and logistic nightmare,” he added. “Yet, we cannot delay any further. The ungoverned spaces needed to be closed up quickly by motivated men with the singular objective to save the nation; That takes us to the number two issue of financing and arming large recruitment.”  Recall that in June, the Director-General of the National Youth Service Corps, Brig.Gen Shuaibu Ibrahim, says corps members are part of the national defence policy of Nigeria and can be mobilised for war if need be.  The NYSC boss said, “Corps members are on reserve. They are part of the national defence policy of this country. So, where there is serious war, our corps members are educated, they are knowledgeable and they can be trained. You see the drill and so on.  “You can imagine within the short three weeks in the orientation camps, the corps members are moulded. They are like soldiers. You see female corps members blowing the army horn, playing with the military band.  “So, if not for the knowledge, where are you going to mobilise such young Nigerians to train them quickly to put in their best for the country? So, corps members are on reserve. They are also part of the national defence policy.”",Recruit National Youth Service Members Into Military To Fight Boko Haram – Governor Fayemi Tells Buhari,mixture

Reacting to a question on whether former Lagos governor, Bola Tinubu should be president of Nigeria in 2023, Mr Peller says that the president’s office should be based on strong institution rather than individuals. He said criteria should be set, leaving whoever meets the criteria to occupy the office.  “We need to build an institution now, we do not need to take any single person and be saying we want to now rally around that person. I think let us form an institution, let us identify a criteria and let us see who meets up with the criteria.  “There is no institution that has set up the criteria yet, if the criteria says the next president should be christian, is Asiwaju a christian?,” Mr Peller told Sam Olatunji in an interview.  Mr Peller, like Mr Tinubu, is a member of the ruling All Progressives Congress.  The House of Representatives member further stated that relying on personalities to save Nigeria was a mistake, and that the next president should be elected through institutions capable of ensuring the competency of the individuals.  “We have made the mistake two times. There was a time in Nigeria when President Obasanjo was brought from prison and everybody was saying he is the best person that could do this and we started to run around him. The Same thing happened to President Buhari, everybody was saying Mohammadu Buhari is a saint, he is not corrupt and then everyone starts to run around him, I believe this must stop,” Mr Peller said.  Mr Tinubu returned from London Friday evening after spending three months undergoing surgery and a follow up therapy on his knee.    A statement by his media office said the former Lagos governor was back and ready to contribute his quota to developing the country’s democracy and economy.  Mr Tinubu is believed to be revving up his political machinery to contest for presidency in 2023.

Get the latest nostalgia features and photo stories from Belfast Nostalgia straight to your inbox  Northern Ireland is suffering a real shortage of staff in the hospitality sector.  Just a month after many reopened their doors for the first time since 2020 some have been unable to keep their usual business hours despite a steady flow of customers through the city's still music-deprived venues.  Colin Neill, Hospitality Ulster's CEO, admits he doesn't know one pub, café, restaurant or hotel that has not been short of staff since reopening in May.  He also says no one ""really has a handle"" on just how many workers the industry is short but that it is now the second biggest challenge they are facing after coronavirus.  In a frank interview with Belfast Live, Mr Neill said: ""I don't know anybody who is fully staffed.  ""It's huge and it's not just Northern Ireland - it's right across the UK. I would say after COVID, it's our next biggest challenge and for a number of reasons. Pre-COVID we were Northern Ireland's fourth-largest sector employer with 54,000 direct jobs. Nobody has a handle on the shortage because nobody knows.  ""If you ask anybody, they say 'I need every type' of staff.""  The pandemic struck a huge blow to the businesses where people gathered to socialise but Mr Neill said Brexit has also hit hard in terms of workforce and rising food prices.  (Image: Pic: Justin Kernoghan/Belfast Live)  ""Coming into Brexit there was a reduction in access to labour and pre-Brexit there was a global shortage of chefs, then when we got into COVID our European workforce went home,"" he explained. ""They were maybe worried about getting sick here on their own or went home to look after family and then haven't come back.  ""We have then obviously people on furlough and when you are on furlough you can have another job.  ""I know a case of one person who had another job, got furloughed in that job and then got another job - so they were getting two furloughs and a salary. Others are going 'I'm not going to come back yet because I don't know if you will get to stay open' - there's all the uncertainty until people know we are fully back.""  Colin says the industry is facing ""huge challenges"" finding staff as a result and that it relates to ""every job role going"".  ""There just aren't the bodies - that's the killer. I don't know where they are,"" he continued.  ""You could argue 'you pay crap for dishwashers' or whatever,"" but he said ""it's at every level - from managerial level right through, skilled, unskilled, front of house, back of house"".  (Image: Justin Kernoghan/Belfast Live)  ""Chefs are well paid here and they just don't exist,"" he added.  ""There's a number of factors playing into it but what we are seeing is resulting in premises opening a limited time because they don't have the staff to run them for full hours.  ""People are short staffed and instead of opening a seven day week, you're opening five.""  Mr Neill says they are also seeing people asking to work four longer days instead of five in search of a better ""work-life balance"" on their return to hospitality - which is also creating some change.  Asked if the industry is reconsidering its rates of pay, he said: ""You can only pay what you can charge and you have people complaining about the price of a pint.  ""People have got used to supermarket prices and all of the overheads, the rates, the lights, the seats you are sitting in, the rent - all that has to be paid for and it's a case of - if we pay staff more we will have to put the prices up - and people complain so you are always caught.  ""Plus, in Northern Ireland we have only got half the disposable income of the rest of the UK, so again, price points. Then you've got business rates.  ""Our business rates are the highest in the UK and we have higher energy costs. People keep saying to me - you're nearly the same price as London - [but] we have the same costs. Larne's business rates on the main street are the same as Regent Street in London.""  In order to try and help fill some of the roles needed, Colin said Hospitality Ulster has set up a task force to work on the issue. He says jobs across the industry are also being widely advertised while the industry is working with government departments in relation to apprenticeship schemes.  I relation to the current opening, he said: ""There's just not enough people to respond to them and a lot of people who are in other jobs are saying 'I'm not coming back until you are permanently open'.  ""That's the big thing because if they have gone off and got another job driving for Amazon or working in a supermarket, [they're saying] I don't know if there'll be furlough in three or four months and [what] if I come back and you're shut.  ""There's a lot of factors pressing on it.""

If there is no response by February 19 they will begin a legal challenge on the matter.  They noted that during the Troubles, republicans carried out 2,200 murders, while soldiers claimed almost 240 lives – the vast majority lawful killings. But disproportionately, they said, since 2007 almost exactly the same number of ex-soldiers and republicans have faced prosecution for pre-1998 killings – six and seven respectively.  But Sinn Fein MLA Linda Dillon responded that there can be no immunity for current or former soldiers.  “British soldiers cannot be placed above the law,” she said. “Any attempt to create immunity for current or former British soldiers is unacceptable.”  Suggestions that the “British Crown Prosecution Service” is unfairly prosecuting veterans is “frankly preposterous” she said.  Legacy mechanisms were agreed by Dublin and London in the Stormont House Agreement and must now be implemented “in full in a human rights compliant manner” she added.",Veteran Dennis Hutchings starts legal challenge against ‘discriminatory prosecutions’ of ex-soldiers,false

But families do not all experience inflation in the same way, official figures only tell part of the story.  Low-income people are always most affected by rises because, if you are only just making ends meet and your costs rise, there is no spending to cut back without affecting your living standards.  The poorest households spend three times as much on gas and electricity bills as the richest and those bills are expected to rise sharply in April.  Image: Getty Images) Getty Images)  At the same time, there is evidence that the price of ‘value’ products at supermarkets is rising faster than typical supermarket items, and that the availability of these items is becoming scarcer.  Jack Monroe, the food writer, has started a campaign for statistics to better represent the rising cost of food for the poorest. But we currently don’t have good data on how low-income families are experiencing food price inflation.  Regardless, we do know that the decision of turning on the heating or putting food on the table – something that many take for granted – is becoming a source of financial stress.  This should not be happening to anyone in a rich country like Britain. The Government needs to focus its response on low-income families.

Noah also requires 2,900 calories a day, meaning their food bill is “through the roof”, and they receive very little financial support.  Shelley, from Chepstow, South-East Wales, said: “Because of the changing tariffs I had a bill for seven weeks which was £165 and instead was £376 for electricity.  “It’s not just that.

Email: jack.wright@mailonline.co.uk Advertisement  Parents have launched a campaign to prevent ‘overzealous’ schools from imposing masks in schools after teaching unions threatened to derail Boris Johnson’s easing of Covid curbs.  Head teachers in England are set to ignore the Prime Minister’s bonfire of Plan B restrictions by compelling pupils to wear face coverings in classrooms.  Britain’s big teaching unions have accused the embattled Tory leader of making the decision to save his own political career as he handles the fallout from ‘Partygate’, rather than basing it on ‘sound public health and scientific advice’.  The National Education Union warned against lifting Omicron measures ‘too quickly’, claiming it could lead to ‘more disruption’ for schools.  Its general secretary Dr Mary Bousted called the removal of masks ‘premature’, adding: ‘Rather than announcements aimed at saving Boris Johnson’s job, (the) Government should be exercising a duty of care to the nation’s pupils and the staff who educate them.’  Geoff Barton, the ASCL’s boss, said: ‘There is a danger that we are heading once again for a situation in which the Government gives the impression that the crisis is over when in actual fact there is huge disruption continuing to take place in education’.  Parent group UsForThem, which campaigned to get classrooms reopened during the pandemic, has now urged its supporters to bombard MPs and ministers with letters to ‘stop overzealous local public health authorities from unilaterally implementing face masks in schools’.  Mr Johnson’s easing of Omicron curbs was also welcomed by senior Conservative backbencher Robert Halfon and the National Deaf Children’s Society.  It comes as a recent poll by parent voice charity Parentkind found that nearly two thirds of parents of secondary school children are not in favour of masks in the classroom. There was less opposition among parents to coverings in communal school areas.  Schools are preparing to defy the Prime Minister by ordering children to continue wearing masks in classrooms  Parents have launched a campaign to prevent ‘overzealous’ schools from imposing masks in schools  Parent group UsForThem, which fought to get classrooms reopened during the pandemic (left, campaigner Molly Kingsley), has now urged its supporters to bombard Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi (right) MPs and ministers with letters to ‘stop overzealous local public health authorities from unilaterally implementing face masks in schools’  In a statement to MPs in the Commons yesterday, Boris Johnson announced WFH guidance would be immediately dropped and rules on masks in schools would also be scrapped from today. Other restrictions including compulsory face coverings on public transport and in shops will end next Thursday  So what is changing... and when will it happen? Your guide to the post-curb rules as Boris Johnson announces the end of Covid Plan B restrictions IMMEDIATELY WORKING FROM HOME The Prime Minister said the Government is no longer asking people to work from home. He called on people to speak to their employers about arrangements for returning to the office. FROM TODAY MASKS IN SCHOOLS From today, secondary school pupils will not have to wear face coverings in classrooms. The requirement to wear masks in corridors and other communal areas will end next Thursday, January 27. FROM NEXT THURSDAY MASKS IN PUBLIC PLACES From next Thursday, the Government will no longer legally mandate the wearing of face coverings in shops and on public transport. But they will continue to suggest masks should be worn in enclosed and crowded places where people could come into contact with those they do not normally meet. The Prime Minister said this meant the Government will 'trust the judgment of the British people and no longer criminalise anyone who chooses not to wear one'. COVID PASSPORTS Proof of vaccination or a recent negative test will no longer be needed to enter nightclubs and large venues from next Thursday. But businesses will still be free to use the NHS Covid Pass if they want. BY THE END OF THE MONTH TRAVEL An announcement is expected soon on scrapping the requirement for fully vaccinated travellers to take a Covid test on returning to England. No 10 said the rules will be reviewed by the end of January. CARE HOMES Plans to ease restrictions on care home visits will be announced in the next few days. At present, care homes must impose severe restrictions on visitors for up to 28 days if there has been a Covid outbreak affecting two or more residents. BY MARCH AT THE LATEST SELF-ISOLATION Boris Johnson said he 'very much expects' not to renew the legal requirement to self-isolate with Covid when the rules lapse on March 24. He said this could happen even earlier, if the data allows. The legal requirement will be replaced with guidance that urges people with the virus to be careful and considerate of others. BY JULY FREE TESTS Free Covid lateral flow tests look set to be scrapped by July. People will be pointed towards an online ordering system to purchase the tests, which cost £30 for a pack of seven. Advertisement  The draft letter by UsForThem warns that unless the Government steps in to ‘curtail the abilities of local authorities to introduce measures themselves, I fear that millions of children will still be subjected to masks in schools for months to come’.  ‘To reverse the damage, the new guidance you issue must be extremely strongly worded indeed,’ the letter adds.  ‘You should certainly forbid local authorities from unilaterally implementing face masks in schools. In some US states where governors have banned mask mandates, they have protected children by making legal provision for parental opt-out.’  The National Deaf Children’s Society today warned that schools which choose to impose masks risk flouting the Equality Act.  Mike Hobday, its director of campaigns, told MailOnline: ‘Government guidance in England does not recommend masks are used by teachers or pupils in class from today, and from the whole school next week.  ‘If schools choose to go against this recommendation, they would need to be confident that they have taken all the action needed to ensure they are fully complying with the Equality Act so that disabled children can access teaching and learning.  ‘Unless these reasonable adjustments are made, there may be little point in deaf children even going to school.’  In a statement to the Commons yesterday, Mr Johnson announced WFH guidance would be dropped immediately and rules on masks in schools would also be scrapped from today. Other restrictions including compulsory face coverings on public transport and in shops, and Covid passes for entry to nightclubs and large events will end next Thursday.  And the legal requirement for people with Covid to isolate will also be allowed to lapse when the regulations expire on March 24.  The move could help appease Mr Johnson’s Tory critics after a ‘Pork Pie Putsch’ against the PM over the lockdown party scandal melted away last night.  However, head teachers wrote to parents after Mr Johnson’s announcement to say that they would like children to continue wearing masks.  Andy Byers, head of a state secondary in Durham, said the PM’s Plan B U-turn ‘creates some difficulty for us’.  ‘Case rates in the northeast are still relatively high. We currently have 60+ students and ten staff absent, having tested positive. A small proportion of those people have been quite poorly,’ he said.  ‘Other local secondary schools are all in a similar position: high levels of absence with some students missing important face-to-face teaching, and a reliance on supply teachers covering lessons.  ‘For this reason I would like to encourage students to continue wearing face coverings for the next two or three weeks until (hopefully) case numbers fall.’  A spokeswoman for school leaders’s union NAHT admitted that there is ‘some concern’ about the easing of Plan B measures.  Its general secretary Paul Whiteman said: ‘The Prime Minister’s statement about lifting plan B measures will feel, to many school leaders, at odds with the current situation on the ground.  ‘Mass disruption is ongoing, with high numbers of staff and pupils absent. School leaders are telling us they still feel very much in the eye of the Covid storm.’  Willingdon Community School in Eastbourne, East Sussex, also wants its pupils to continue wearing masks.  Head teacher Emily May said: ‘Our students have been fantastic wearing masks since October 2021 and understand that this small act of kindness is helping to keep our community safe.  ‘We still have significant Covid infections within the school community and a 10 per cent rise of Covid cases in this local area.  ‘It is not sensible to relax this measure yet. However, we do appreciate that each school needs to be able to make their own decision based on their school context and it needs to be reviewed regularly.’  Children at Hanley Castle High School, Worcestershire, have also been told to keep wearing face coverings.  Lindsey Cooke, the head teacher, said: ‘I do think this was a very rushed announcement.  ‘Our year 11 and year 13 exam groups have missed so much school already; what we do not want to do is to rush into taking masks off and then get another outbreak in those year groups.’  But other teachers welcomed the end of masks in schools. Joseph Sparks, an assistant principal at Stationers’ Crown Woods Academy in Greenwich, London, today called face coverings a ‘barrier to learning’.  Has your child been sent home for refusing to wear a mask? Email: jack.wright@mailonline.co.uk Advertisement  He told Sky News: ‘We welcome the change here at the academy and ultimately we will follow the advice and guidance given to us by the DfE. And as you can see from the students in this particular class, they’ve opted not to wear one this morning.  ‘But we’ll leave that choice to them, and for us at the academy, it’s about making them safe and making sure their learning experience is a seamless one and can continue as normal as possible.’  Pressed on why masks can be a ‘barrier to learning’, he explained: ‘I had an example yesterday where I was teaching a class, and I didn’t know who had answered the question.  ‘Sometimes it can be a bit of a barrier like that to that social interaction that takes place, and knowing which students might need help. Ultimately we’ve left that choice to the students from this point.’  Mr Sparks added: ‘Our job is to keep the students as safe as possible. We’ve taken lots of measures over the course of the various lockdowns to ensure that our students remain safe.  ‘We’ve been really fortunate… our students have continued to come to the academy every day, we’ve had really had attendance.’  It comes as business chiefs hailed yesterday’s WFH announcement, calling it ‘great news for small businesses and city centres that rely on office workers’.  And nightclub bosses indicated that they won’t continue enforcing Covid passes after next Thursday, telling Radio 4’s Today programme that there is ‘no proof anywhere in the world that nightclubs are any worse than any indoor setting’ for virus transmission.  However, London Mayor Sadiq Khan put himself at odds with the PM by ordering TfL customers to continue wearing masks on TfL Tube and bus services.  Britain’s top medics also insisted that scrapping Covid curbs at such pace ‘risks creating a false sense of security’ with the NHS still under pressure.  Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chair of the British Medical Association council, said: ‘This decision clearly is not guided by the data. When Plan B was introduced in December, there were 7,373 patients in hospital in the UK. The latest data this week shows there are 18,9791.’  He warned that ending mandates on mask-wearing would ‘inevitably increase transmission’ and place the most vulnerable at a higher risk.  And Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation representing health bodies, said now ‘is not the time for complacency about this virus’.  Let the mask madness begin: Confusion as commuters are told to wear and not wear coverings at the SAME station after TfL and rail firms issued conflicting orders - as some shoppers ditch them ALREADY Boris Johnson’s mask U-turn descended into chaos today after TfL and rail firms issued conflicting orders and shoppers ditched them early. The Prime Minister is scrapping all Covid curbs in England, including compulsory masks on public transport from next Thursday. Already this morning, in an Asda supermarket in south London binned their masks and went without in a show of brazen non-compliance. John Lewis and Waitrose became the first major stores to confirm that masks are no longer necessary. A spokesman told MailOnline that it will ‘suggest’ masks are worn, but stressed ‘it will be down to individuals to make a personal choice’. However, London Mayor Sadiq Khan has warned that face coverings will remain a ‘condition of carriage’ on all TfL services including Tubes, buses, Overground trains, trams or river boats – meaning people without masks may be denied travel unless exempt. TfL said that 500 officers and ‘police partners’ will be out across the network in the coming days to ensure that customers continue to comply with the Government’s restrictions until the law expires next week. The service warned that ‘those who do not wear face coverings may be prevented from using our services or asked to leave the network’. Messaging on masks threatened to collapse further into farce after the Rail Delivery Group said National Rail would only ask people to wear masks in busy indoor settings. This creates the bizarre situation in London where masks will be required on some services but not others travelling on the same tracks between the same stations – because one is operated by Transport for London and the other is not. For example, commuters travelling from Kensington Olympia to Shepherd's Bush will need to wear masks on Overground trains but not on Southern services. Advertisement  Deputy chief executive of NHS Providers Saffron Cordery said that some trusts had reported they were expecting their peak later this week despite a fall in case numbers nationally due to regional variations in the number of hospital admissions.  ‘That's why it's important that there is recognition that this surge isn't over, and that the health service is still operating under extremely challenging circumstances,’ she added.  However, business chiefs cheered the latest easing. Kevin Ellis, chairman of PwC UK, told the Times: ‘The No1 question I’m being asked from our people is when can we get back to the office – they value time with colleagues, alongside the flexibility to work from home.  ‘After the last lockdown restrictions were lifted, it took us two months to get back to 80 per cent capacity. We’re expecting a faster bounce-back now – people know the drill’.  Shevaun Haviland, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said the easing of Plan B would be applauded by her members, ‘particularly those based in city and town centres which rely on footfall from office workers’.  Chris Hirst, global CEO of Havas Creative, told Radio 4’s Today programme that ‘many of our employees really do want to come back’ and predicted most of the UK workforce would be back in the office from Monday. He added that he would be talking to individual staff nervous about the WFH relaxation.  Matthew Fell, the CBI's chief policy director, said: ‘It's great news that Plan B is coming to an end and businesses will be hopeful that we are finally starting to turn the corner on Covid-19.  ‘There's a vital need now for greater consistency in how we live with the virus in the longer term. Swinging back and forth between restrictions and normality has been damaging.’  Mr Fell said hybrid working would remain, as firms sought a balanced approach to home and office working.  He added: ‘There are clear benefits to being in the office, such as collaboration and on-the-job learning, and blanket work-from-home guidance has had significant downsides for city centre trade in sectors such as hospitality and retail.’  Jace Tyrrell, Chief Executive of the New West End Company said: ‘With office employees set to return to London's West End, retailers, bars and restaurants will be looking ahead to a promising year.  ‘With the support of returning shoppers and Government alike, we are confident that the West End can achieve £7.5billion of turnover this year as it continues on the long road to recovery.’  The Federation of Small Business also welcomed the move, though bosses warned it was not all good news, against a backdrop of higher taxes and business rates.  Its chairman Mike Cherry said: ‘We would now urge everyone to get behind small firms – be that on a commute, whilst working from home, online, or in-person – as they work night and day to recover from another incredibly stressful festive season.  ‘Equally, it’s important to respect the house rules that each individual small firm has implemented to keep its customers and staff safe – many have invested thousands in making premises more secure.  ‘Small firms and sole traders stand ready to spur our economic recovery from this recession as they did the last. After new import checks took effect this month, however, they are now staring down the barrel of a jobs tax hike, a dividend taxation increase and business rates bills landing in April.  ‘The Government should be looking at policies that will empower small businesses and start-ups to get our economy firing on all cylinders again.’  It comes after Covid cases fell in most parts of the UK for the first time since early December, according to the Office for National Statistics.  Mr Johnson said that while there are some places where cases are likely to continue rising, including in primary schools, scientists believed ‘it is likely that the Omicron wave has now peaked nationally’.

Ministers draw up plans to require passengers to show proof of booster jab to enter UK with all testing rules set to be dropped for the fully-vaccinated  Ministers are set to ditch the Covid testing system for fully vaccinated holidaymakers within days.  The move will give the hard-hit travel industry another boost after the Government scrapped pre-return tests and costly post-arrival PCR swabs earlier this month.  It will save a family of four around £80 to £100 on testing costs. As it stands, returning double-jabbed Britons must take one rapid lateral flow test by day two. If positive, they must take a confirmatory PCR test.  But ministers are preparing to scrap this requirement, with an announcement by next Wednesday. It will be the first time fully-vaccinated Britons can go abroad without having to test on return since travel swabs were introduced in January last year.  Ministers are set to ditch the Covid testing system for fully vaccinated holidaymakers within days  Prime Minister Boris Johnson speaking during Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday  It is understood the definition of ‘fully vaccinated’ could remain two jabs rather than three until spring. After that, travellers who have not received a booster jab could face testing restrictions.  Unvaccinated travellers will remain subject to multiple tests and self-isolation.  Transport Secretary Grant Shapps is said to have been leading the charge for scrapping the remaining testing restrictions.  However, all arrivals will still need to fill out a passenger locator form within 48 hours of arrival in England.  Boris Johnson came under pressure in the Commons over the issue from his predecessor yesterday after announcing Plan B curbs would be lifted.  The move will give the hard-hit travel industry another boost after the Government scrapped pre-return tests and costly post-arrival PCR swabs earlier this month  Former PM Theresa May said: ‘If we’re going to learn to live with Covid, we need to facilitate travel.  'So will [Mr Johnson] take this opportunity to announce that when Plan B restrictions are removed next week, the Government will also make it clear that there will be no testing requirements for anybody entering England who is fully-vaccinated?’  He replied: ‘We’re certainly reviewing the testing arrangements for travel and [Health Secretary Sajid Javid] will be making a statement in the next few days.’  Alluding to the fact many countries will likely require three jabs as a condition of entry, he added: ‘But I think it’s very important everybody in the country understands that getting your booster, wherever you want to go in the world, is going to be a pretty crucial thing to do.’  Tim Alderslade, chief executive of Airlines UK, said: ‘Ministers have been saying all the right things about needing to get on with our lives – this feels like the last hurdle to achieving that.’  So what is changing... and when will it happen? Your guide to the post-curb rules as Boris Johnson announces the end of Covid Plan B restrictions  IMMEDIATELY  WORKING FROM HOME  The Prime Minister said the Government is no longer asking people to work from home. He called on people to speak to their employers about arrangements for returning to the office.  FROM TODAY  MASKS IN SCHOOLS  From today, secondary school pupils will not have to wear face coverings in classrooms.  The requirement to wear masks in corridors and other communal areas will end next Thursday, January 27.  Face masks in schools will no longer be required from next Thursday  FROM NEXT THURSDAY  MASKS IN PUBLIC PLACES  From next Thursday, the Government will no longer legally mandate the wearing of face coverings in shops and on public transport.  But they will continue to suggest masks should be worn in enclosed and crowded places where people could come into contact with those they do not normally meet.  The Prime Minister said this meant the Government will 'trust the judgment of the British people and no longer criminalise anyone who chooses not to wear one'.  COVID PASSPORTS  Proof of vaccination or a recent negative test will no longer be needed to enter nightclubs and large venues from next Thursday.  But businesses will still be free to use the NHS Covid Pass if they want.  BY THE END OF THE MONTH  TRAVEL  An announcement is expected soon on scrapping the requirement for fully vaccinated travellers to take a Covid test on returning to England.  No 10 said the rules will be reviewed by the end of January.  CARE HOMES  Plans to ease restrictions on care home visits will be announced in the next few days. At present, care homes must impose severe restrictions on visitors for up to 28 days if there has been a Covid outbreak affecting two or more residents.  BY MARCH AT THE LATEST  SELF-ISOLATION  Boris Johnson said he 'very much expects' not to renew the legal requirement to self-isolate with Covid when the rules lapse on March 24.  He said this could happen even earlier, if the data allows.  The legal requirement will be replaced with guidance that urges people with the virus to be careful and considerate of others.  BY JULY  FREE TESTS  Free Covid lateral flow tests look set to be scrapped by July.  People will be pointed towards an online ordering system to purchase the tests, which cost £30 for a pack of seven.",Parents fight back after schools vowed to defy end of Plan B and force pupils to wear masks,mixture

Liz Truss erupts at EU  Joining one of the world’s largest free trade areas would ultimately trigger major tariff cuts in industries such as food, drink, cars and tech.  Additionally, the UK would form closer alliances with 11 current members including Australia, Canada, Japan, Malaysia and Singapore.  In a report for the Centre for Policy Studies (CPS), Conservative MP Anthony Mangnall points out that membership could see the proportion of UK exports eligible for tariff-free access rising from 85.4% to 99.9%, with the potential to boost GDP by up to £20billion a year if the US joined the CPTPP before the UK managed to agree a bilateral FTA with Washington.  “CPTPP offers a huge opportunity for Britain,” he writes. “The benefits of joining are clear – an economic boost to the whole of the UK, geo-political support to our allies and the development and standardisation of global trade rules.  “Our membership to CPTPP does not reduce our high standards or strip away our sovereignty [but] seeks to raise standards and provides a platform for the UK to play a leading role in shaping the future of trade.”  Foreign Secretary Liz Truss made becoming a member of the CPTPP a key priority for the UK in her previous role as International Trade Secretary.

43,244835145053545660365643759223246279254,"UPDATE, 21 February 2022: Following the publication of this article we were made aware of subsequent research that raised issues with the 2014 academic study referenced in this piece. The 2016 paper, published in journal Weather and Climate Extremes, found there was no difference in the death tolls between male- and female-named storms.  Storm Eunice is poised to descend upon us, bringing with it a rare Met Office “red” alert in south Wales and southwest England – but you may not have noticed.  For even though the government is poised to hold an emergency Cobra meeting to discuss the potential impact and risk to life of 100mph winds, and warnings that Storm Eunice could be among the UK’s worst in 30 years, over on social media it’s memes and jokes about its name that are being blown around.  “I'm sorry but calling a storm Eunice does not make me fearful or aware,” said one tweet. “It makes me think of a kindly old lady offering me a slice of Battenburg and a cup of tea.”  David Baddiel also said: “I'm not convinced that a storm called Dudley, or indeed one called Eunice, presage a sense of devastation. I think they presage a sense that these storms might offer you a nice cup of tea.”  And others agreed: “My mum’s name is Eunice so I just can’t take this storm seriously!”; “Storm Eunice has toilet seat covers and toilet roll covers in her bathroom”; “They should have more fearsome names like ‘Storm Insanity’ or ‘Storm This May Rip Your Roof Off’, I’d take notice then”. Other responses were more questionable, suggesting that we should be scared of Eunice, but not for the right reasons: “She is 56 and been menopausal once!” one person quipped.  And while some people rightly pointed out that there really isn’t much to be intimidated about by the naming of Storm Dudley, either (which has already seen winds and rain sweep Scotland, northern England and Northern Ireland, bringing down power lines, trees and railway cables, causing widespread travel disruption), there’s a bank of fascinating psychological research to back up the fact that overall, female-titled storms and hurricanes are in fact far more deadly.  Why? Because people don’t take them as seriously; so don’t take as many precautions to protect themselves, and there are consequently more deaths. That’s right: storms are sexist.  If you don’t believe me, believe the research: scientists used more than six decades of death rates from US-based hurricanes to show that feminine-named hurricanes cause significantly more deaths than masculine-named hurricanes. They put this down to a key element – gender-based expectations.  To keep up to speed with all the latest opinions and comment sign up to our free weekly Voices Dispatches newsletter by clicking here  “Feminine-named hurricanes (vs masculine-named hurricanes) cause significantly more deaths, apparently because they lead to lower perceived risk and consequently less preparedness,” the study authors state. “Using names such as Eloise or Charlie for referencing hurricanes has been thought by meteorologists to enhance the clarity and recall of storm information. We show that this practice also taps into well-developed and widely-held gender stereotypes, with potentially deadly consequences.”  Kiju Jung, lead author on the study, which was published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 2014, said: “The problem is that a hurricane’s name has nothing to do with its severity. Names are assigned arbitrarily, based on a predetermined list of alternating male and female names. If people in the path of a severe storm are judging the risk based on the storm’s name, then this is potentially very dangerous.”  It’s clear that Storm Eunice certainly has the potential to be deadly: forecasters fear 100mph winds in some parts of the country may endanger lives, tear roofs from houses and bring down power lines. When it hits on Friday, it is also expected to bring snow and rain, with some meteorologists likening the anticipated wind spread and power to what was seen during the infamous Burns Day Storm in 1990.  It’s fascinating to see how we translate our own implicit biases into wider weather events, and Storm Eunice offers an opportunity: both to look at ourselves, to do some rigorous self-analysis – and, most importantly, to stay indoors.",The sexist reason you’re not as scared of Storm Eunice as you should be,false

Data from the Office for National Statistics also said the proportion of over-65s in debt rose from 12 to 16 percent from 2012 to 2016. The Labour Party research is likely to raise concern that many pensioners had been struggling financially before this year’s cost-of-living squeeze struck.  Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said PM Boris Johnson had “no credible plan to help retired people with rocketing heating bills and price rises”.  Mr Ashworth said it would be a “bleak, tough year for retired people”. He said Labour would save OAPs up to £600 a year by scrapping winter energy bill VAT and offering targeted extra help.  The research follows separate data earlier this year, showing pensioners already pay twice as much for energy as those under 30.  It means older households face being hardest hit by the 54 percent rise in the Ofgem energy bills cap due in April.  Under the change, a typical household including at least one person over 65 will face an increase of around £700 a year.

The Expos é is now heavily censored by Google, Facebook, Twitter and PayPal. Let’s not lose touch, subscribe today to receive the latest news from The Exposé in your inbox…  The Covid-19 figures for England are produced by the UK Health Security Agency (see here).    Their latest data is available as a downloadable pdf here.  Page 43 contains data on Covid-19 cases in England by vaccination status from 3rd Jan 22 to 30th Jan 22 –  The following chart shows the total number of cases in England by vaccination status between 3rd Jan and 30th Jan 22 by vaccination status –  The following chart shows the total number of cases among people aged over 18 in England by vaccination status between 3rd Jan and 30th Jan 22 by vaccination status –  As you can clearly see, despite the not-vaccinated population being forced to suffer more restrictions than the fully vaccinated population, England is very much experiencing a pandemic of the fully vaccinated, with the vaccinated over 18 population as a whole recording a shocking 1.67 million cases in January 2022, compared to just 228,750 cases among unvaccinated people over the age of 18.  The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) kindly provide us with the case-rates per 100k population by vaccination status. However, their Week 2 – 2022 – Vaccine Surveillance Report was the last time they published the case-rates per 100k among the double vaccinated, instead choosing to only publish the case-rates per 100k among the triple vaccinated since.  But thankfully we can work out what these case rates among the double vaccinated ourselves.  Method  To calculate the case-rate per 100k among the double vaccinated we first have to work out the overall population size of the double vaccinated, and to do this we need to look at the numbers in the Week 2 – 2022 Vaccine Surveillance Report from the UKHSA.  In the week 2 report they provide combined figures for the double and triple vaccinated. So we need to work out the total population size for each age group provided by using the provided case-rate figure for the double/triple vaccinated and the provided total number of cases for the double/triple vaccinated.  Then we just divide the number of cases by the case rate, and then multiply the answer by 100,000 to work out the total population size of the double and triple vaccinated in the Week 2 -2022 Vaccine Surveillance Report.  Next we need to calculate the population size of each age group in the triple vaccinated demographic in the Week 5 -2022 Vaccine Surveillance Report using the same method.  Then we just subtract the triple vaccinated under 18’s in week 5 from the double and triple vaccinated in week 2, to work out the total population size of the double vaccinated in week 5.  Finally, to work out the case rate per 100k among double vaccinated in the week 5 report all we have to do is divide the total population size by 100,000 , and then divide the number of cases among the double vaccinated under 18’s by the answer to the previous equation.  Here are the calculated population sizes for all over 18’s in England who have been double vaccinated and triple vaccinated according to the UKHSA Vaccine Surveillance Report – Week 5 – 2022 –  Here are the Covid-19 case-rates per 100,000 by vaccination status for each age group over the age of 18 in England, plus the average case rate per 100,000 for all adults in England –  Now that we know the case-rates, we can use Pfizer’s vaccine effectiveness formula to work out the real-world vaccine effectiveness.  Unvaccinated case rate – Vaccinated case rate / Unvaccinated case rate = Vaccine Effectiveness  e.g. Double Vaccinated 18-80+: 1,846.38 – 5,226.1 / 1,846.38 = minus-183%  Therefore, the average real-world Covid-19 vaccine effectiveness in England for all adults as a whole is MINUS-183%. This means fully vaccinated adults are more likely to catch Covid-19 than unvaccinated adults. This is what vaccination has done to the people of England.  But vaccine effectiveness isn’t really a measure of a vaccine, it is a measure of a vaccine recipients immune system performance compared to the immune system performance of an unvaccinated person.  The Covid-19 vaccine is supposed to train your immune system to recognise the spike protein of the original strain of the Covid-19 virus. It does this by instructing your cells to produce the spike protein, then your immune system produces antibodies and remembers to use them later if you encounter the spike part of the Covid-19 virus again.  But the vaccine doesn’t hang around after it’s done the initial training, it leaves your immune system to take care of the rest. So when the authorities state that the effectiveness of the vaccines weaken over time, what they really mean is that the performance of your immune system weakens over time.  The problem we’re seeing here is that the immune system isn’t returning to its original and natural state. If it was then the outcomes of infection with Covid-19 would be similar to the outcomes among the not-vaccinated population.  Instead, it continues to decline at a rate that means the not-vaccinated population have a better performing immune system, so this means the Covid-19 injections are decimating the immune systems of the fully vaccinated.  But to work out immune system performance we have to alter the calculation used to work out vaccine effectiveness slightly and divide our answer by either the largest of the vaccinated or unvaccinated case rate.  Unvaccinated case rate – Vaccinated case rate / largest of the unvaccinated / vaccinated case rate = Immune System Performancee.g. Double Vaccinated 18-80+: 1,846.38 – 5,226.1 / 5,226.1 = minus-65%  This means on average, fully vaccinated Brits currently have a 65% lower immune response than the unvaccinated have to Covid-19, but the following chart shows the true extent of the damage by age group as well –  Therefore, the average fully vaccinated person in England is down to the last 35% of their immune system for fighting certain classes of viruses and certain cancers etc. The question is, when will the remaining 35% of their immune system be depleted?  Unfortunately, further data on hospitalisations and deaths in England as well as Scotland suggests that for some of the fully vaccinated it may already be completely depleted.  Because the Covid-19 vaccines are now also showing a negative effectiveness against hospitalisation and death, which means the fully vaccinated are more likely to be hospitalised and die of Covid-19 than the unvaccinated, suggesting Covid-19 vaccine induced acquired immunodeficiency syndrome has taken hold.  Public Health Scotland publish a weekly Covid-19 Statistical Report containing data on Covid-19 cases, hospitalisations and deaths by vaccination status.  The following chart shows the percentage of Covid-19 deaths by vaccination status in Scotland between 25th Dec 21 and 21st Jan 22, according to the report they published Wednesday 2nd February –  The following graph shows the age standardised Covid-19 death rates per 100,000 individuals by vaccination status in Scotland. The data has been extracted from table 16, found on page 54 of the PHS Covid-19 Statistical report published Wednesday 2nd Feb 22.  In the most recent week ending 21st Jan the fully vaccinated were statistically over twice as likely to die of Covid-19 than the unvaccinated.  The highest death-rate in the past month among the fully vaccinated was recorded as 15.49 per 100,000 individuals in the week beginning 15th Jan. But the highest death rate among the unvaccinated came in the week beginning 8th Jan at 10..93 per 100,000.  This means deaths are falling in the unvaccinated but increasing at a steady rate among the fully vaccinated. This shouldn’t be happening if the vaccines are effective and do not damage the innate immune system.  The following chart shows the real-world vaccine effectiveness against death over the past four weeks according to figures supplied by Public Health Scotland –  Vaccine effectiveness against death has been negative since at least Dec 25th, and has dropped to a staggering minus-112% as of the 21st Jan 22.  This doesn’t just mean that the vaccines do not work. It means they are damaging the innate immune system, and here’s how much damage they have done on average –  The problem with the data from Scotland though is that they only supply an age-standardised rate per 100,000 individuals, therefore we’re only able to see the average extent of the damage.  But based on the theory that the Covid-19 injections are causing damage to the innate immune system that worsens by the week, we should expect to see things are much worse among the elderly because they were first to be vaccinated, and unfortunately data from England confirms this is the case.  Real world Covid-19 vaccine effectiveness against death in England between 3rd Jan and 30th Jan 22 was as low as -110.24% in the over 80’s, -97% in people aged 70-79, and -98.14% on average in all adults over age 18.  Here’s what that means in terms of the fully vaccinated populations immune system performance against death –  Keeping in line with the theory that the vaccines have caused damage to the immune system that worsens by the week we can see that the lowest immune system performance is among those who were vaccinated first, with the over 80’s recording an immune system performance of -52.4%, and then the 70-79 age group recording an immune system performance of -49.2%.  There is however a concerning anomaly in this data in that we should expect to see a positive immune system performance among the 30-39 age group of around 29%, but instead it is currently at -15.4%. There could be several explanations for this but none of them are good.  Either the 30-39 year-olds are genuinely doing worse, or all other age groups are doing much worse than what we are being told.  The average immune system performance against death among all adults equates to -50% in England, which is not far behind the average -53% seen in Scotland. Because vaccination began at the same time we would expect these to be around the same.  This therefore means that we can be assured the data is reliably telling us the Covid-19 injections are not just ineffective, but damage the immune system to the point that the recipients are developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and are much more likely to die than the unvaccinated population.  These truly astonishing figures show that we are at least 2x safer from Covid-19 than the vaccinated in a room, a restaurant, a bar, a night club, a train, a boat, or a plane full of unvaccinated people than we are with “fully vaccinated” people.    It also looks like the unvaccinated are reaching herd immunity against Covid-19 whereas the fully vaccinated are being prevented from reaching it by the vaccines.  The fully vaccinated fare so badly against Covid-19 now because vaccine induced antibodies against the Alpha spike protein are next to useless against Omicron. So the underlying progressive immune system damage wrought by incessant spike protein production has almost nothing to hide behind, nothing to offset itself against.    We therefore see in these figures a much closer estimate of how much damage has been done to vaccinated people than we were able to see with delta figures for cases in the vaccinated and unvaccinated..  Official UK Government Covid-19 data now not only shows that every fully vaccinated person will have full blown vaccine mediated AIDS in a very short amount of time unless something drastically changes, it suggests the elderly have already hit the point of no return.  This will cause a massive burden on the health service, and massive pain suffering and death. All of which has been inflicted upon us by a corrupted healthcare system. This must be the biggest own goal in medical history.

The sudden scramble two years later by Democratic governors to lift mask mandates ""is a clear pivot consequent to their horrible polling numbers,"" Malone said. ""It's exactly what I predicted when people were asking me, 'How will we know when this thing is over?' I've said, 'Well, you'll know it because they'll all start giving awards to each other and claiming that they're the ones that are responsible for curing it.'""  Malone also discussed explosive new data from the Defense Medical Epidemiology Database (DMED) regarding possible COVID vaccine side effects, which three military medical whistleblowers recently came forward with when they saw a significant increase in common vaccine injuries during 2021.  ""DMED was something that Lt. Col. Theresa Long and some of her colleagues queried when they were busy doing diligence to try to understand what they were seeing with their own warfighter communities that they were sworn to protect as physicians,"" Malone explained.  ""And they were seeing signals that were unusual, and so they consulted the DMED database and were shocked to find enormous increases in 2021, when the vaccine mandates were implemented to the military, compared to 2020 in a wide variety of diseases, including cancers, things related to reproduction and female reproductive health.""  Malone was asked about recently released emails exposing a plan by three top federal public health officials to discredit the anti-lockdown epidemiologists behind the Great Barrington Declaration. The exchange showed the three — then-National Institutes of Health (NIH) Director Francis Collins, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Director Dr. Anthony Fauci, and NIAID Deputy Director for Clinical Research and Special Projects Dr. Clifford Lane — coordinating ""a quick and devastating takedown"" of the premises of the declaration, which espouses ""focused protection,"" a mitigation strategy prioritizing the most vulnerable populations.  ""[T]hey slandered and defamed those three as 'fringe' epidemiologists, but they happen to be full professors at the obscure universities Oxford, Stanford and Harvard, I believe,"" Malone said sarcastically, referring to Sunetra Gupta, Ph.D., Jay Bhattacharya, MD, Ph.D., and Martin Kulldorff, Ph.D., respectively.  ""And please note that neither Dr. Fauci nor Dr. Collins nor Dr. Lane have any formal training in epidemiology,"" Malone added.  Malone also reacted to the news that the South African doctor who discovered the Omicron variant said she was pressured not to call the new COVID variant a ""mild"" illness in public.  ""So what we're looking at,"" he said, ""is really quite shocking: It runs across all of health care, it runs all the way through Health and Human Services, it runs across all the Western nations — there seems to be some odd collusion, and that has been focused on amplifying the fear and suppressing any counter-narrative.""",'We've known how to cure COVID since about March of 2020': Dr. Robert Malone,false

Just 22 Conservatives rebelled against the Government last week by voting for an amendment to the Environment Bill which sought to place a legal duty on water companies not to pump sewage into rivers.  Sewage pollution is a key component of what MPs have heard is a chemical cocktail of pollutants going into rivers, with raw sewage being discharged into waters more than 400,000 times last year.  It comes seven weeks after wastewater plants were told by the government they may dispose of sewage not fully treated due to a shortage of chemicals caused by the lorry driver crisis.  The amendment, introduced in the House of Lords by the Duke of Wellington, would have also forced water companies and the Government to 'take all reasonable steps' to avoid using the combined sewer overflows, which regularly release untreated waste into rivers and seas.  Campaign groups including Surfers Against Sewage said it was crucial to ensure action to tackle sewage pollution started now.  But Environment Secretary George Eustice recommended MPs reject amendments to the bill, just days before Boris Johnson hosts world leaders at the Cop26 climate change summit in Glasgow.  The vote caused a huge backlash on social media, with Twitter users posting images of the MPs who shot down the amendment.

Supply chain issues affect levels of sewage treatment chemicals Wastewater plants were told by the government last month that they may dispose of sewage not fully treated due to a shortage of chemicals caused by the lorry driver crisis. Some of the chemicals used in the sewage treatment process became one of the products left in short supply by the driver shortage, caused by a combination of Brexit and the Covid pandemic. Plants were told they may dispose of effluent not fully treated because of disruption caused by 'supply chain failure' in a regulatory position statement issued at the start of September. The statement came from the Environment Agency, which introduced a waiver that would allow some companies to bypass the third stage in the treatment process if they are not in possession of the right chemicals. Defra (the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs) said the waiver specifically related to a shortage of ferric sulphate, an acidic solution used to suppress the growth of algae. The government agency said the regulatory position statement (RPS) would apply until the end of the year, after which companies would required a permit in order to continue the practice.

A government source told MailOnline: 'Tory MPs have categorically not voted to allow water companies to dump raw sewage into our rivers and seas. The provisions in the Environment Bill will deliver progressive reductions in the harm caused by storm overflows. The Environment Bill requires us to set a target to drive progress on water quality, and we are already taking significant action to address water quality more widely. Claims to the contrary are simply wrong.'  The measure is now set to return to the Lords on Tuesday, where peers are expected to send it back to the Commons later next week - possibly on Thursday - and force another vote among MPs.  The Duke of Wellington, a crossbench peer, said he believed the amendment would stimulate investment in improving the systems, which date back decades and are in severe need of upgrades.  It comes as figures collected by charity the Rivers Trust show that all of England's rivers are currently failing to pass cleanliness tests, with 53 per cent of them in a poor state at least partly because of water companies releasing raw and partially-treated sewage.  In England, just 14 per cent of rivers have good ecological status and none have good chemical status because water companies are currently allowed to release raw sewage into rivers and seas as part of a 'combined sewer overflow', a legacy of Britain's Victorian drainage system, The Telegraph reported.  This means rainwater and liquid waste are combined in the same tanks and overflows into waterways as an escape valve, rather than backing up into homes and streets.  Among those campaigning to clean up British waterways is former Undertones singer Feargal Sharkey, who last year announced plans to start legal action over the Environment Agency's management of England's rivers.  Last year, raw sewage was discharged into waters more than 400,000 times. Pictured: Pollution in the Jubilee River at Eton Wick, Berkshire last year  He previously said: 'As a nation, we're going to have to face a very simple situation. Do we want our rivers full of our own human waste?  Hertfordshire's River Mimram turns PURPLE with pollution, just hours after environment ministers posed in front of it to announce plans to protect and restore England's rare chalk streams River Mimram in Hertfordshire turned purple with pollution, just hours after environment ministers posed in front of it over plans to restore rare chalk streams. When environment Minister, Rebecca Pow and members of the Chalk Stream Restoration Group visited the river, it was a clear looking stream. Not long after they left, the chalk stream, that runs through North Hertfordshire from Hertford, turned a shade of purple, according to pop star and clean river campaigner Feargal Sharkey, who shared an image of the stream on Twitter. Campaigners said this highlights the dire state of Britain's rivers, where 53 per cent are in a poor state, and only 14 per cent are in 'good ecological condition.' The Environment Agency said the river had already returned to normal when it returned to investigate, and found no evidence of any harm to fish from the incident. They can't say what caused it to turn purple, but campaigners speculate it could be anything from an algae bloom to dyes seeping into water from industry. Advertisement  'The truth is, unfortunately, there's been a long term issue about failure of regulatory oversight, lack of political leadership, most of that, driven by concerns about the price of water, and now we've reached the situation through incompetence that every river is now basically full of sewage.'  In April this year, MPs were told that water companies poured raw sewage into rivers for three million hours last year, while paying shareholders billions in dividend payments.  The environmental audit committee heard that the huge Mogden treatment plant sent the equivalent of 400 Olympic swimming pools worth of raw effluent into the Thames over two days last autumn.  Sewage is allowed to be discharged only during periods of heavy rain, but Mr Sharkey told MPs the River Chess and Chesham plant in Buckinghamshire 'was discharging sewage for 35 days, one continuous discharge'.  Peter Hammond, retired former professor of computational biology at University College London, said his analysis of sewage treatment works had found 160 breaches of permits granted by the EA to allow sewage discharges.  He said the watchdog has only prosecuted 174 cases of illegal discharges in the last decade.  'My research has found that many of the treatment works do not continue to treat a minimum rate of sewage when they are spilling and many of these illegal spills are not identified by the EA,' Hammond told MPs on the environmental audit committee.  'My research found 160 breaches of permits in 2020. I believe they are in order of magnitude that I think is 10 times more … than the agency have identified.'  The EA revealed there were 403,171 spills of sewage leaked into England's rivers and seas in 2020 due to 'storm overflows'. It also said that there were more than 3.1 million hours of spillages in 2020.  The data was published 'proactively' for the first time as part of a pledge to increase transparency around the issue.",Fury as Tory MPs vote to allow water companies to dump raw sewage into Britain's rivers and seas,false

Firstly, let’s look at why this is happening.  2 I know how anxious families across the country will be feeling about the news energy prices are going up, says Rishi Sunak  There are a few factors causing energy prices to rise so dramatically, and unfortunately they are mostly out of the Government’s control.  One is the steep rise in demand for gas in places such as China, which has pushed up global prices.  Another is the fact that we have had a colder than usual winter so we have used up more of our own stores of gas here at home.  All this means that, on average, people will be seeing their energy bills rise by £693.  There are no two ways about it: That is a big hit for people to take and I don’t underestimate it one bit.  That is why, to cushion the blow, I have taken some steps that will provide families with £350, which will cover more than half the cost of the rise.  People will get that £350 in two different ways.  Four out of five households will get £150 in April as a discount to their council tax bills — so cash is there in your bank account straight away to help with the rise in cost.  Then, in the autumn, everyone will get £200 off their energy bills that will be repayable over the course of five years.  We have done it in this way to ensure that help is targeted at those who need it most, while also providing some support for those in the squeezed middle — the local schoolteacher, hospital nurse or police officer — who will be feeling the pinch too.  Heating help  This is also the responsible way to respond to what is a significant shock.  Throughout my time as Chancellor I have always tried to come at problems in a fair way and with the humility that I can’t always do everything for everyone.  It would be very easy for me to stand up — as the Labour Party has done time and time again — and announce unfunded packages worth tens of billions of pounds of your money without being honest about how it will be paid for or the impact it will have on our public finances.  It is not right and it is not credible.  I wouldn’t be doing my job properly if I shirked tough decisions today for them only to come round again tomorrow.  Take the NHS and our social care reform, for example.  We made a difficult decision last year that in order to tackle the unacceptable backlogs caused by the pandemic, as well as to pay for vaccines and integrate our health and social care system, we would have to raise the money to do so.  We can’t borrow for wholesale reform and we were upfront about that from the beginning.  It would be very easy for me to stand up — as the Labour Party has done time and time again — and announce unfunded packages worth tens of billions of pounds of your money without being honest about how it will be paid for or the impact it will have on our public finances.  It is a long-term plan that needs long-term funding, and while we don’t want to burden people, we need to ensure they get the quality of healthcare they expect and deserve.  And that’s not just for this year, it’s for next year, the year after and beyond. And it wouldn’t be right to ditch that now.  We have made a plan and we are going to stick to it.  But that doesn’t stop us from helping where we can, with what we hope are short-term, temporary shocks, as we have done with our Energy Bill Rebate, which will help people to heat their homes now.  Sadly, I don’t have a crystal ball, so I can’t predict or control when energy prices will come down or when inflation will stop rising.  But I can help absorb the shock for people in the short term, while remaining on course to get our borrowing and debt down.  Economic recovery  We have always been the party of sound money — we will always continue to be on my watch — and that is the only kind of party I am interested in.  Our economic recovery has been one of the strongest in Europe, but there are still challenges we face and the toll Covid has taken on the public coffers has been great.  I’m not afraid to make the tough but right decisions to ensure I — and future Chancellors after me — can respond in emergency situations and in the best interests of the country.  2 We have always been the party of sound money","Cost of living crunch is a big hit but we have to fix the NHS, says Rishi Sunak",false

The colossal rock mass named by NASA as the Asteroid 2013 YD48 is said to be a 'potentially hazardous object'.  The asteroid measures around 104 metres wide and will pass within 3.38 million miles of Earth on January 11th.  Although the distance the asteroid will pass seems enormous, it is not actually that much in terms of distance in space, as it has been reported that NASA classifies anything passing within 120 million miles of Earth as a Near-Earth Object (NEO).  As the asteroid will be travelling a considerable distance, even a small change in its trajectory could have catastrophic consequences for Earth.  Scientists are tasked with tracking thousands of asteroids to calculate whether or not they could be heading towards Earth.  (Image: gettyimages.ie)  However, Asteroid 2013 YD48 is not the only asteroid that will be coming close to Earth in the coming weeks, as three more are set to pass by the Earth before it does so.

Speaking to reporters in the US, the Prime Minister said in-person appointments were vital in ensuring life-threatening conditions were picked up early. And he firmly rejected a warning from the head of the Royal College of GPs that face-to-face appointments may never return to pre-pandemic level. Before the pandemic, about 80 per cent of consultations took place in a doctor’s surgery – but as of July, the figure stood at just 57 per cent. Advertisement  It comes a day after Martin Marshall, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, told MPs that the 'reality' is full-time GPs will soon be extinct.  GPs conducted an average of 1.29million consultations each Monday in July but just 1.09million on Fridays – a fall of 16 per cent.  And, over the past year, there were around 10million fewer appointments in total on Fridays than there were on Mondays, according to the latest data from NHS Digital.  Separate figures show three in four GPs work less than full-time, meaning fewer than 37.5 hours a week. And a more granular analysis reveals one in 12 GPs work only 15 hours a week or less.  Dennis Reed from Silver Voices, a campaign group for the over-60s, said: 'Doctors should be offering a full service and it is simply not good enough to be tapering off care at the end of the week.  'Patients don't stop getting sick just because it's Friday. This risks leaving people sick or in pain over the weekend or pushing them to A&E.'  Responding to the figures, Professor Marshall said that flexible working – which allows GPs to work less than full time – 'enables highly-trained family doctors to remain in the workforce, delivering the care that our patients need and deserve'.  He added: 'It is down to individual practices to allocate their services in line with their team's capacity and their understanding of [patients'] needs.'  Some 85 per cent of Britons think they should be entitled to an 'in-person' GP appointment – and not be fobbed off with a remote consultation by phone or video  The Daily Mail's campaign to win the right for all patients to have face-to-face care from their family doctor has received a tidal wave of public support.  Some 85 per cent of Britons believe they should be entitled to an 'in-person' appointment with their GP – and not be fobbed off with a remote consultation by phone or video.  More than half (53 per cent) say they struggle to obtain a face-to-face appointment, with nearly three in ten (27 per cent) who have asked to see their GP in person in the past year saying they have been told no.  More than four out of five (83 per cent) say they prefer traditional in-person consultations, and nearly two thirds (65 per cent) say illnesses are likely to get worse if they are treated remotely.  The findings of the J L Partners survey for this newspaper come after Britain's top GP sparked controversy by defending the huge rise in online consultations by GPs since the pandemic outbreak.  Some 85 per cent of Britons believe they should be entitled to an 'in-person' appointment with their GP – and not be fobbed off with a remote consultation by phone or video  Before the pandemic, four in five GP consultations were in person, but the latest figure for July is under six in ten.  Martin Marshall, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, said Covid safety curbs and high demand meant it was impossible for family doctors to offer all patients an in-person appointment just because they would 'like' one.  But the Mail survey reveals the public overwhelmingly rejects his argument. A massive 95 per cent say 'face-to-face' consultations result in a more accurate diagnosis – and 75 per cent say the success of the vaccine rollout means Covid is no longer a valid reason for GPs to decline to see people at local surgeries.  Former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith said: 'I hope everyone from GPs to government will listen to this poll, as it shows what the public really want. They must act on it. There is no way that Covid can any longer be seen as an excuse to stop holding as many in-person appointments.'  The findings of the survey come after Britain's top GP Martin Marshall sparked controversy by defending the huge rise in online consultations by GPs since the pandemic outbreak.  Professor Marshall said about 80 per cent of GP appointments were conducted face to face prior to the pandemic, dropping to 10 per cent in the first wave. Now this figure is around 56 per cent  Professor Marshall added that remote consultations continue to play a role in reducing the spread of coronavirus  Phone chats failed to pick up hospice carer's cancer A hospice carer who died from cancer after struggling to arrange a face-to-face GP appointment was ‘failed by the system’, say her grieving daughters. Gill Dutton, 65, devoted ten years of her life providing end-of-life care to cancer patients at St Giles Hospice in Tamworth, Staffordshire. But when she developed a persistent cough at the start of the pandemic, the grandmother of three was only offered brief telephone consultations. Gill Dutton with her daughter Lisa McBlane, 33 Her GP dismissed her cough in her first appointment in April last year, saying that it was probably caused by having had Covid and that it would pass on its own. Six months later, a severely delayed CT scan revealed that she had developed stage four lung cancer and doctors gave her just three years to live. Although she responded well to her first two rounds of chemotherapy, she picked up a chest infection in July. The former caregiver died at home in Tamworth last month, leaving behind her husband, two daughters and a son. Both of Mrs Dutton’s grief-stricken daughters are today backing the Daily Mail’s campaign, saying they hope to prevent future heartbreak for others. Her eldest daughter Liz Parker, 35, said: ‘Nothing we can do will bring Mum back but if this campaign helps stop another person going through the same thing, it’s worth it. 'Mum would do anything for anybody. She really did devote her life to looking after others. So it makes it more painful that she was not looked after as she should have been.’ Mrs Dutton’s youngest daughter, Lisa McBlane, 33, also believes her mother might have survived if she had been treated sooner. The NHS midwife asked: ‘Why weren’t the signs spotted earlier? I can only think that their [the doctors’] judgment was clouded by the pandemic.’ Both daughters are now planning to write to their GP to demand answers surrounding their mother’s care. Mrs Parker added: ‘It is fair to say that the system failed her. Had my mum been seen earlier, she might still be here.’ Advertisement  Oncologist Professor Karol Sikora, former director of the World Health Organisation's cancer programme, also called on ministers to take action on the basis of the Mail's poll.  He said cancers will be missed if GPs did not get back to seeing more patients face to face, adding that doctors were using Covid was an 'excuse' not to go back to pre-pandemic levels of in- person appointments.  Professor Sikora said: 'The Government have got to listen to this poll and get GPs back to normal. They must insist that all patients with new symptoms must be seen in person. Remote appointments are okay for follow-ups but not for new patients.  'It's very difficult to assess people over Zoom and the telephone, and you will miss cancer diagnoses. If symptoms persist, the cancer will eventually be diagnosed – but it could happen after a delay of several months.  'Face-to-face appointments really do make a difference. If you can't see a patient properly, you can't see how ill they really are. You can't examine them, you can't feel their lymph nodes, you can't feel their tummy, you can't listen to their chest.'  In one of the survey's most damning findings, 40 per cent say the reduction in traditional face-to-face care by GPs is designed to 'make the lives of GPs easier' – only 11 per cent say it is designed to improve the health of patients.  The poll shows enormous support for every aspect of the Mail's five-point campaign to revive in-person care.  Our manifesto includes making face-to-face appointments the default and that anyone who wants to see their family doctor in person should be able to do so, with incentives for surgeries if necessary.  There is huge backing for this newspaper's call for Boris Johnson to deliver on his election vow to recruit 6,000 more GPs and provide 50 million more appointments a year.  And the survey indicates it is not just GPs in the public's firing line: a total of 43 per cent say fewer face-to-face appointments are the result of the Government's failure to recruit enough doctors; 29 per cent blame doctors themselves.  In addition to the difficulties in getting to see a GP in person, the poll underlines how hard it is for patients to get through to their local surgery in the first place.  Barely one in four (28 per cent) got through the first time when they last called their surgery; 15 per cent said it took between six and 15 calls, and 8 per cent had to make more than 15 calls.  Twelve per cent said they had to wait two weeks for their appointment – or did not get one at all.  Alarmingly, 26 per cent said they had given up seeking treatment after trying – and failing – to get help from their GP in the past year. More than one in ten (11 per cent) turned to private health care instead.  The public is sceptical about the growing practice of GPs asking patients to send a photograph showing any sign of illness. A total of 50 per cent say this is unacceptable; 37 per cent have no objection.  The elderly are at most risk from the move towards more consultations conducted by phone or video, according to the survey. A total of 59 per cent say they fear the health of older people will be damaged.  More than half (52 per cent) say cancer is the condition most likely to go undiagnosed as a result of a remote consultation; 15 per cent say they fear those with dementia or other mental health problems are most vulnerable.  According to the survey, there is one popular, albeit controversial, way for the Government to reduce the strain on GPs: slap tough penalties on those who repeatedly fail to turn up for GP appointments for no good reason.  A total of 73 per cent say such people should be fined; astonishingly, a total of 44 per cent would fine them as much as £50; 15 per cent would ban them altogether from the local surgery – and 4 per cent would force them to carry out community service such as sweeping the streets.  Only 8 per cent of those surveyed opposed any sanction. J L Partners interviewed 1,060 adults online yesterday.","Family doctors now treat 200,000 fewer patients on Fridays",mixture

More info  Last week, European Commission vice president Maros Sefcovic outlined a set of measures to the UK aimed at resolving post-Brexit trade issues in Northern Ireland. These included eliminating 80 percent of regulatory checks and cutting customs processes on the movement of goods between Britain and the island of Ireland. But the European Union proposals have fallen a long way short of what the UK is demanding, which includes the removal of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) as the final arbitrator in any future trade dispute between the two sides.  Brussels officials are becoming increasingly impatient, and have implied there could be a trade war if the UK does not cave to some of the key problems Lord Frost has raised. However, a shocking report from Facts4EU.Org suggests the EU's ‘UK Treasure Island’ delivers a staggering 69 percent of the bloc's entire world trade surplus. In the 12 months to the end of August, the report revealed EU goods sales to the UK totalled a huge £252.2billion. EU purchases from the UK were just under half of that at £131.7billion, meaning the EU's trade surplus - the difference between exports and imports - stood at £120.5billion.  Brexit news: A potential trade war could have a huge impact on the EU  Brexit news: The EU's trade with the UK totalled £252.2billion  As a result, trade with the UK delivers 69 percent of EU’s entire trade surplus with the rest of the world, which totals £175.4billion, Facts4EU.org suggests. The group explained in its report: ""In the case of the United Kingdom’s relationship with the EU over the last 12 months, this difference is stark. ""The balance in favour of the EU is now over £120 billion pounds per annum. ""This is approximately 10 times the UK’s gross contribution to the EU when it was still a member state.

""The UK accounted for an astonishing 68.7 percent of this, or £120.5billion (€137.4biliion)."" The analysis also suggests, for the 12-month period, trade data shows the EU has been selling an average of £691million worth of goods to the UK every day. There is also a massive gap between what the EU27 sells to the UK - and what the UK sells to the EU27 - with the bloc's sales to Britain now 91 percent higher than the UK’s sales to the EU.

Facts4EU explained: ""Our research show that one in seven of all purchases of EU goods (by value) which are made outside the EU come from Brexit Britain.

Putting this at risk will certainly get the attention of most boardrooms around the EU."" Reacting to the report, European Research Group vice chairman David Jones said: “If the Commission truly care about the interests of the EU businesses that ultimately pay their handsome wages, they will swiftly agree to sensible terms with the UK. ""Otherwise, they will be the losers.” Conservative Party MP Sir John Redwood also said: ""UK consumers will buy more local items, the more the EU threatens us.”",‘Treasure island’ Trade war would blow huge hole in EU as £250BN in UK sales at risk,mixture
55,328343318343078310545820219316669118135,"Madam Deputy Speaker,  Employment is up.  Investment is growing.  Public services are improving.  The public finances are stabilising.  And wages are rising.  Today’s Budget delivers a stronger economy for the British people:  Stronger growth, with the UK recovering faster than our major competitors.  Stronger public finances, with our debt under control.  Stronger employment, with fewer people out of work and more people in work.  Growth up, jobs up, and debt down:  Let there be no doubt – our plan is working.  Madam Deputy Speaker,  This Budget is about what this Government is about.  Investment in a more innovative, high-skilled economy.  Because that is the only sustainable path to individual prosperity.  World class public services.  Because these are the common goods from which we all benefit.  Backing business.  Because our future cannot be built by government alone but must come from the imagination and drive of our entrepreneurs.  Help for working families with the cost of living.  Because we will always give people the support they need and the tools to build a better life for themselves. And levelling up.  Because for too long, far too long, the location of your birth has determined too much of your future.  Because the awesome power of opportunity shouldn’t be available only to a wealthy few…  …but be the birth right of every child in an independent and prosperous United Kingdom.  Madam Deputy Speaker,  Today’s Budget does not draw a line under Covid; we have challenging months ahead.  And let me encourage everyone eligible to get their booster jabs as soon as possible.  But today’s Budget does begin the work of preparing for a new economy post Covid.  The Prime Minister’s economy of higher wages, higher skills, and rising productivity.  Of strong public services, vibrant communities and safer streets.  An economy fit for a new age of optimism.  Where the only limit to our potential is the effort we are prepared to put in and the sacrifices we are prepared to make.  That is the stronger economy of the future.  And this Budget is the foundation.  Inflation  Madam Deputy Speaker,  The House will recognise the challenging backdrop of rising inflation.  Let me begin by carefully explaining what is happening in our economy and why.  Inflation in September was 3.1% and is likely to rise further – with the OBR expecting CPI to average 4% over next year.  The majority of this rise in inflation can be explained by two global forces.  First, as economies around the world reopen, demand for goods has increased more quickly than supply chains can meet.  Having been shut down for almost a year, it takes time for factories to scale up production…  …for container ships to move goods to where demand is, for businesses to hire the people they need.  And second, global demand for energy has surged…  …at a time when supplies have already been disrupted, putting strain on prices:  In the year to September, the global wholesale price of oil, coal and gas combined, has more than doubled.  The pressures caused by supply chains and energy prices will take months to ease.  It would be irresponsible for anyone to pretend that we can solve this overnight.  I am in regular communication with finance ministers around the world…  …and it’s clear these are shared global problems…  …neither unique to the UK, nor possible for us to address on our own.  But where the Government can ease these pressures, we will act:  To address the driver shortage, the Transport Secretary is introducing temporary visas…  …tackling testing backlogs, changing cabotage requirements…  …and is today announcing new funding to improve lorry park facilities.  We’ve already suspended the HGV levy until August and I can do more today…  …extending it for a further year until 2023, and freezing Vehicle Excise Duty for heavy goods vehicles.  To help with the cost of living, we’ve introduced a new £500m Household Support Fund…  …and today’s Budget will further support working families.  And in terms of our fiscal policy, we are going to meet our commitments on public services and capital investment…  …but we are going to do so, keeping in mind the need to control inflation.  And, finally, I have written to the Governor of the Bank of England today to reaffirm their remit to achieve low and stable inflation.  And people should be reassured: they have a strong track record in doing so.  I understand people are concerned about global inflation – but they have a Government here at home ready and willing to act.  Growth and Labour Markets  And, Madam Deputy Speaker,  In a period of global uncertainty, you need to work hard to maintain a strong economy and be responsible with the public finances – and that is what we’re doing.  I’m grateful to the OBR for their work, and I’m pleased to say they now expect our recovery to be quicker.  Thanks to this Government’s actions, they forecast the economy to return to its pre-covid level at the turn of the year – earlier than they thought in March.  Growth this year is revised up from 4% to 6.5%. The OBR then expect the economy to grow by 6% in 2022, and 2.1%, 1.3% and 1.6% over the next three years.  In July last year, at the height of the pandemic, unemployment was expected to peak at 12%.  Today, the OBR expect unemployment to peak at 5.2%.  That means over 2 million fewer people out of work than previously feared.  And wages are rising: Compared to February 2020, they have grown in real terms by almost three and a half per cent.  I can confirm for the House that the OBR’s forecast for business investment has been revised up over the next five years.  And because of the actions we took to support our economy…  …we have been more successful than previously feared in preventing the long-term economic damage of covid.  The OBR have today revised down their scarring assumption from 3% to 2%.  In the depths of the worst economic crisis on record we set out a Plan for Jobs.  A plan that was backed by business groups and trade bodies.  A plan that has helped millions of people and saved millions of jobs.  A plan that the OBR have today described as: “remarkably successful”.  Madam Deputy Speaker,  Today’s forecasts confirm beyond doubt…our Plan for Jobs is working.  Public Finances  And, Madam Deputy Speaker,  Disruption in the global economy highlights the importance of strong public finances.  Coronavirus left us with borrowing higher than at any time since the Second World War.  As the Prime Minister reminded us in his conference speech:  Higher borrowing today is just higher interest rates and even higher taxes tomorrow.  So we need to strengthen our public finances so that when the next crisis comes, we have the fiscal space to act. Today I am publishing a new Charter for Budget Responsibility.  The Charter sets out two fiscal rules which will keep this government on the path of discipline and responsibility. First, underlying public sector net debt…  …excluding the impact of the Bank of England…  …must, as a percentage of GDP, be falling.  Second, in normal times the state should only borrow to invest in our future growth and prosperity.  Everyday spending must be paid for through taxation.  Both rules must be met by the third year of every forecast period…  …giving us the flexibility to respond to crises while credibly keeping our public finances under control.  These rules are supplemented by targets to spend up to 3% of GDP on capital investment…  …and keep welfare spending on a sustainable path.  Madam Deputy Speaker,  The House will be asked to vote on our Charter, giving Members a simple choice.  To abandon our fiscal anchor and leave our economy adrift with reckless unfunded pledges.  Or to vote for what we on this side of the House know is the right course:  Sound public finances and a stronger economy for the British people.  Madam Deputy Speaker,  Important as the Charter is, our credibility comes as much from what we do as what we say.  So I’m pleased to tell the House that because our plan is delivering a stronger economy…  …and because we’ve taken tough but responsible decisions on public finances…  …the OBR report today that all our fiscal rules have been met.  Underlying debt is forecast to be 85.2% of GDP this year, then 85.4% in 2022-23, before peaking at 85.7% in 2023-24.  It then falls in the final three years of the forecast from 85.1% to 83.3%.  Borrowing as a percentage of GDP is forecast to fall in every single year.  From 7.9% this year to 3.3% next, then 2.4%, 1.7%, 1.7% and 1.5% in the following years.  Borrowing down, debt down; proving once again it is the Conservatives – and only the Conservatives - who can be trusted with taxpayers’ money.  Fiscal Strategy  Madam Deputy Speaker,  I have made four fiscal judgements in this Budget.  First, we will meet our fiscal rules with a margin to protect ourselves against economic risks.  That is the responsible decision at a time of increasing global economic uncertainty…  …when our public finances are twice as sensitive to changes in interest rates as they were before the pandemic….  …and six times as sensitive as they were before the financial crisis.  Just a one percentage point increase in inflation and interest rates would cost us around £23bn.  My second judgement today is to continue supporting working families…  Third, as well as helping people at home, our improving fiscal position means we will meet our obligations to the world’s poorest.  I told the House that when we met our fiscal tests, we would return to spending 0.7 per cent of our national income on overseas aid.  Some people said this was a trick or a device.  I told this House – it was no such thing.  And based on the tests I set out, today’s forecasts show that we are, in fact…  …scheduled to return to 0.7 in 2024-25 – before the end of the Parliament.  And Madam Deputy Speaker, my fourth fiscal judgement is this:  Today’s Budget increases total departmental spending over this Parliament by £150bn.  That’s the largest increase this century, with spending growing by 3.8% a year in real terms.  As a result of this Spending Review, and contrary to speculation…  …there will be a real terms rise in overall spending for every single department.  And public sector net investment as a share of GDP will be at the highest sustained level for nearly half a century. If anyone still doubts it, today’s Budget confirms:  The Conservatives are the real party of public services.  Public Services  Madam Deputy Speaker,  Our stronger economy lays the foundation for everything we want to achieve in today’s Budget:  World-class public services and more investment in our future growth.  Before I turn to the details, I’d like to thank My RHF the Chief Secretary.  Completing the Spending Review in such challenging circumstances was a tall order – and thankfully we had just the man for the job.  Madam Deputy Speaker,  At the start of this Parliament, resource spending on healthcare was £133bn.  Today’s Spending Review confirms that by the end of this Parliament, it will increase by £44bn to over £177bn.  And the extra revenue we’re now forecast to raise from the Health and Social Care Levy is going direct to the NHS and social care as promised.  The health capital budget will be the largest since 2010.  Record investment in health R&D, including better new-born screening…  …as campaigned for by the Member for the Cities of London and Westminster.  40 new hospitals.  70 hospital upgrades.  More operating theatres to tackle the backlog.  And 100 community diagnostic centres.  All staffed by a bigger, better-trained workforce, with 50,000 more nurses and 50 million more primary care appointments.  As well as funding to deliver the Prime Minister’s historic reforms to social care…  …we’re providing local government with new grant funding over the next three years of £4.8bn…  …the largest increase in core funding for over a decade.  And we’re investing more in housing and home ownership, too.  With a multi-year housing settlement totalling nearly £24bn.  £11.5bn to build up to 180,000 new affordable homes – the largest cash investment in a decade, 20% larger than the previous programme.  And we’re investing an extra £1.8 billion:  Enough to bring 1,500 hectares of Brownfield land into use…  …meet our commitment to invest £10bn in new housing…  …and unlock 1 million new homes…  We’re also confirming £5bn to remove unsafe cladding from the highest risk buildings…  …partly funded by the Residential Property Developers Tax, which I can confirm will be levied on developers with profits over £25m at a rate of 4%.  And we’ve also already reduced rough sleeping by over a third, but we will go further…  …with £640m a year for rough sleeping and homelessness…  …an 85% increase in funding compared to 2019.  Madam Deputy Speaker,  Today’s Budget funds our ambition to recruit 20,000 new police officers;  Provides an extra £2.2bn for courts, prisons and probation services, including £0.5bn to reduce the courts backlogs…  Pays for programmes to tackle neighbourhood crime, reoffending, County Lines…  …violence against women and girls, victims’ services, and improved responses to rape cases.  And over the next three years, commits £3.8bn to the largest prison-building programme in a generation.  Madam Deputy Speaker,  All governments should aspire to provide greater life chances for future generations.  But few governments can match our ambition.  So let me now turn to what this Budget does to support children.  The evidence is compelling that the first 1,001 days of a child’s life are the most important.  My Right Honourable Friend, the Member for South Northamptonshire has recognised this with her inspirational report.  And we are responding today with £300m for:  A Start for Life offer for families;  High-quality parenting programmes;  Tailored services to help with perinatal mental health;  And, I’m pleased to tell the Member for Congleton, funding to create a network of Family Hubs around the country too.  To improve the quality of childcare, we’re going to pay providers more – with today’s Spending Review providing an extra £170m by 2024-25.  We’re confirming £150m to support training and development for the entire early years workforce.  To help up to 300,000 more families facing multiple needs, we’re investing an extra £200m in the Supporting Families programme.  And we will provide over £200m a year to continue the holiday activity and food programme.  Today’s Spending Review also delivers our commitment to schools, with an extra £4.7bn by 2024-25.  Which combined with the ambitious plans we announced at Spending Review 2019…  …will restore per pupil funding to 2010 levels in real terms…  …equivalent to a cash increase for every pupil of more than £1,500.  And for children with special educational needs and disabilities…  …we are more than tripling the amount we invest to create 30,000 new school places.  And we know that the pandemic caused significant disruption to children’s learning.  We’ve already announced £3.1bn to help education recovery.  Today, as promised by the Prime Minister and Education Secretary, we will go further – with just under £2bn of new funding to help schools and colleges.  Bringing this Government’s total support for education recovery to almost £5bn.  Levelling Up  Madam Deputy Speaker,  As we level up public services, we’re also levelling up communities - restoring the pride people feel in the places they call home.  To do that, we’re providing £560m for youth services, enough to fund up to 300 youth clubs across the country.  Over £200m to build or transform up to 8,000 state-of-the-art community football pitches across the UK.  Funding to turn over 100 areas of derelict land into new ‘pocket parks’.  And I’m allocating the first round of bids from the Levelling Up Fund…  …£1.7bn to invest in the infrastructure of everyday life in over 100 local areas.  With £170m in Scotland, £120m in Wales, and £50m in Northern Ireland…  …more than their Barnett shares…  …this will benefit the whole United Kingdom.  We’re backing projects in:  Aberdeen.  Bury.  Burnley.  Lewes. Clwyd South.  And not one, not two, but three successful projects for the great city of Stoke-on-Trent.  But that’s not all.  We’re also going to fund projects in Ashton under Lyne, South Leicester, Sunderland, Doncaster, and West Leeds. Madam Deputy Speaker,  We’re so committed to levelling up – we’re even levelling up the Opposition front bench.  Creative Industries  Madam Deputy Speaker,  Levelling up is also about protecting our unique culture and heritage.  The British Museum; Tate Liverpool; the York Railway Museum…  …we’re investing £850m to protect museums, galleries, libraries, and local culture.  And thanks to the Culture Secretary, over 100 regional museums and libraries will be renovated, restored and revived.  And she’s secured up to £2m to start work on a new Beatles attraction on the Liverpool waterfront.  We’re also going to review our museum freedoms.  And make our creative tax reliefs more generous.  On current plans, the tax relief for museums and galleries is due to end in March next year…  …just as exhibitions are starting to tour again – so I’ve decided to extend it, for two years, to March 2024.  And to support theatres, orchestras, museums and galleries to recover from covid…  …the tax reliefs for all those sectors – from today until April 2023 – will be doubled.  And they won’t return to the normal rate until April 2024.  That’s a tax relief for culture worth almost quarter of a billion pounds.  Union  And Madam Deputy Speaker, this is a Budget for the whole United Kingdom.  Through the Barnett formula, today’s decisions increase Scottish Government funding, in each year…  …by an average of £4.6bn, Welsh Government funding by £2.5bn, and £1.6bn for the Northern Ireland Executive.  This delivers, in real terms, the largest block grants for the devolved administrations since the devolution settlements of 1998.  The whole of the United Kingdom will benefit from the UK Shared Prosperity Fund, and over time we will ramp up funding…  …so that total domestic UK-wide funding will match EU receipts, averaging around £1.5bn a year.  And we will fund projects across the UK, including:  Funding for the Extreme E race in Scotland – the 2022 Hebrides X-Prix.  Accelerating funding for the Cardiff City Region Deal in Wales.  And funding in Northern Ireland for community cohesion.  And whilst today demonstrates the indisputable fiscal benefit of being part of the United Kingdom.  This is and always will be secondary to the simple truth that we are bound together by more than transactional benefit.  It is our collective history, our culture and our security.  We are, and always will be, one family.  One United Kingdom.  Outcomes/ Value for Money  Madam Deputy Speaker,  Whilst today’s Budget delivers historically high levels of public spending.  Its success will be measured not by the billions we spend but by the outcomes we achieve and the difference we make to people’s lives.  The budgets are set; the plans are in place; the task is clear.  Now we must deliver – because this isn’t the government’s money, it’s taxpayers’ money.  Investment in Growth and Productivity  Madam Deputy Speaker,  Our stronger economy allows us to fund world class public services - the people’s priority.  But over the long-term the only way to pay for higher spending is economic growth.  And if we want to see higher growth, we’ve got to tackle the problem that’s been holding this country back for far too long:  Our uneven economic geography.  As we come out of the worst economic shock we’ve ever seen, we’ve got a choice.  To retrench - or to invest.  This Government chooses to invest:  To invest in our economic infrastructure.  To invest in innovation.  To invest in skills.  To invest in a Plan for Growth that builds a stronger economy for the future.  That’s what this Budget is about and that’s what this Government is about.  Infrastructure  Madam Deputy Speaker,  Infrastructure connects our country, drives productivity and levels up.  That’s why our National Infrastructure Strategy invests, in economic infrastructure like roads, railways, broadband and mobile, over £130bn.  To connect our towns and cities, we’re investing £21bn on roads and £46bn on railways.  Our Integrated Rail Plan will be published soon, dramatically improving journey times between our towns and cities.  But today, we’re providing £5.7bn for London-style transport settlements in:  Greater Manchester. Liverpool City Region. The Tees Valley. South Yorkshire. West Yorkshire. West Midlands. And the West of England.  And we’re helping local transport, everywhere:  With £2.6bn for a long-term pipeline of over 50 local roads upgrades…  Over £5bn for local roads maintenance, enough to fill 1 million more potholes a year…  And funding for buses, cycling and walking totalling more than £5bn.  The Prime Minister promised an infrastructure revolution – this Budget delivers an infrastructure revolution.  Innovation and Ideas  Madam Deputy Speaker,  Investment in our infrastructure is just the first step.  We need to do what the people of this country have always done…  …invent, discover, and create the ideas and technologies that will change the world.  So we will also invest more in innovation.  The UK is already a world-leader.  With less than 1% of the world’s population, we have 4 of the world’s top 20 universities;  14% of the world’s most impactful research;  And the second most Nobel Laureates.  We want to go further.  I can confirm we will maintain our target to increase R&D investment to £22bn.  But in order to get there, and deliver on our other priorities, we’ll reach the target in 2026-27…  …spending, by the end of this Parliament, £20bn a year on R&D.  That’s a cash increase of 50%.  The fastest increase ever.  And I can confirm for the House that this £20bn is in addition to the cost of our R&D tax reliefs.  Combined with those tax reliefs, total public investment in R&D is increasing…  …from 0.7% of GDP in 2018 to 1.1% of GDP by the end of the Parliament.  How does 1.1% compare internationally?  Well, the latest available data shows an OECD average of just 0.7%.  Germany, investing 0.9%.  France, 1%.  And the United States, just 0.7%.  This unprecedented funding will:  Increase core science funding to £5.9bn per year by 2024-25, a cash increase of 37%.  Meet the full costs of associating with Horizon Europe;  Establish the new Advanced Research and Invention Agency with £800m by 2025-26.  And strengthen our focus on late-stage innovation, increasing Innovate UK’s annual core budget to £1bn…  …double what it was at the start of the Parliament.  Net Zero  Madam Deputy Speaker,  There’s more to becoming a science superpower than just what the Government spends on R&D.  Our ambitious Net Zero strategy is also an innovation strategy, investing £30bn to create the new, green industries of the future.  We’ve just issued our second Green Bond, making us the third-largest issuer of sovereign green bonds anywhere in the world.  London last week was named the best place in the world for green finance.  And on Monday, the new UK Infrastructure Bank announced its first ever investment:  £107m to support offshore wind in Teesside.  And to build on this work, one week today I’ll be hosting global finance ministers and businesses at COP26.  Enterprise  And, Madam Deputy Speaker,  Innovation comes from the imagination, drive and risk-taking of business.  That’s why we’ve launched Help to Grow, to turbocharge SME productivity.  Started a new co-investment venture capital fund - Future Fund: Breakthrough.  It’s why I’m announcing today that we will consult on further changes to the regulatory charge cap for pensions schemes…  …unlocking institutional investment while protecting savers.  Its why we’re introducing a new £1.4bn Global Britain Investment Fund…  …supporting transformative economic activity, in our world-leading sectors like Life Sciences.  And it’s why today’s Budget increases the British Business Banks regional financing programmes to £1.6bn…  …expanding their coverage and helping innovative businesses get access to the finance they need, across the whole United Kingdom.  Migration  Madam Deputy Speaker,  A third of our science Nobel Laureates have been immigrants.  Half of our fastest growing companies have a foreign-born founder.  So, an economy built on innovation must be open and attractive to the best and brightest minds.  Thanks to our brilliant Home Secretary, today’s Budget confirms the eligibility criteria for our new Scale-Up Visa…  …making it quicker and easier for fast-growing businesses to bring in highly skilled individuals.  And the Trade Secretary’s new Global Talent Network, launching initially in the Bay Area, Boston and Bangalore…  …will identify, attract and relocate the best global talent in key science and tech sectors.  All part of our plan to make our visa system for international talent the most competitive in the world.  R&D Tax Credits  Madam Deputy Speaker,  If we want greater private sector innovation, we need to make our research and development tax reliefs fit for purpose.  The latest figures show the UK has the second highest spending on R&D tax reliefs in the OECD.  Yet it’s not working as well as it should: UK business investment in R&D is less than half the OECD average.  We’ve reviewed the reliefs and identified two issues we’re solving today.  First, the reliefs need to reflect how businesses conduct research in the modern world.  So, as many businesses have called for, I’m expanding the scope of the reliefs to include cloud computing and data costs.  The second problem is this:  Companies claimed UK tax relief on £48bn of R&D spending.  Yet UK business investment was around half of that, at just £26bn.  We’re subsidising billions of pounds of R&D that isn’t even happening here in the United Kingdom.  That’s unfair on British taxpayers.  And it puts us out of step with places like Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Singapore, Switzerland and the USA…  …who have all focused their R&D tax reliefs on domestic activity.  So from April 2023, we’re going to do the same, and incentivise greater investment here at home.  So, Madam Deputy Speaker:  £22bn investment in R&D.  The Net Zero strategy.  The Future Fund.  Help to Grow.  More regional finance.  Unlocking institutional capital.  A more competitive visa system.  And a modernised R&D tax credits regime . Enough action to prove the hypothesis:  We are making this country a science and technology superpower.  Skills  And, Madam Deputy Speaker,  As well as investing in infrastructure and innovation, there is one further part of our plan for growth that is crucial:  Providing a world-class education to all our people.  Higher skills lead to higher regional productivity.  And higher productivity leads to higher wages.  With 80% of the UK’s 2030 workforce already in work, our future success depends not just on the schooling we give our children but the lifelong learning we offer to adults.  We’ve already done a lot.  Our Plan for Jobs invested in apprenticeships, traineeships, and the Kickstart scheme.  But we need to go further.  Today’s Budget invests in the most wide-ranging skills agenda this country has seen in decades.  We’re increasing skills spending, over the Parliament by £3.8bn - an increase of 42%.  We’re expanding T Levels.  Building Institutes of Technology.  Rolling out the Prime Minister’s lifetime skills guarantee.  Upgrading our FE college estate.  Quadrupling the number of places on our skills bootcamps.  And significantly increasing funding for apprenticeships.  We’re also going to tackle a tragic fact:  Millions of adults in England have numeracy skills lower than those expected of a nine-year-old.  According to the leading charity National Numeracy…  …this costs individuals with poor numeracy up to £1,600 a year in lost earnings.  People with poor numeracy skills are more than twice as likely to be unemployed as their peers.  So, today I can announce a new, UK-wide numeracy programme: Multiply.  With £560m, Multiply will improve basic maths skills…  …and help to change people’s lives across the whole United Kingdom.  So, Madam Deputy Speaker,  We’re building our infrastructure with new roads, railways and broadband…  Cementing our status as a science and technology superpower…  And strengthening the skills of our people, the country’s greatest asset.  That’s a real plan for growth;  That’s how this Government is building a stronger economy for the British people.  Tax reforms for investment  Madam Deputy Speaker,  World class public services are the people’s priority.  Investment in infrastructure, innovation and skills will create the growth we need to pay for them.  But as Conservatives, we know that Government action alone won’t be enough to create a stronger economy.  We want this country to be the most exciting and dynamic place in the world for business.  And now that we’re left the EU, we have the freedom to do things differently and deliver a simpler, fairer tax system.  Tonnage Tax  I want to begin with one of our smallest taxes – but a tax which plays an important role in one of our pre-eminent industries: shipping.  Now that we’ve left the EU, today we start reforming our Tonnage Tax regime to make it simpler and more competitive.  And we’re also making it fairer for UK taxpayers.  When we were in the old EU system, ships in Tonnage Tax regime were required to fly the flag of an EU state. But that doesn’t make sense for an independent nation.  So I can announce today that our Tonnage Tax will – for the first time ever…  …reward companies for adopting the UK’s merchant shipping flag, the Red Ensign.  That is entirely fitting for a country with such a proud maritime history as ours.  Air Passenger Duty  Let me turn now to Air Passenger Duty.  Right now, people pay more for return flights within and between the four nations of the United Kingdom than they do when flying home from abroad.  We used to have a return-leg exemption for domestic flights but were required to remove it in 2001.  But today I can announce that flights between airports in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will…  …from April 2023, be subject to a new lower rate of Air Passenger Duty.  This will help cut the cost of living, with 9 million passengers seeing their duty cut by half.  It will bring people together across the UK.  And because they tend to have a greater proportion of domestic passengers…  …it is a boost to regional airports like Aberdeen, Belfast, Inverness and Southampton.  Airports are major regional employers – so to help them get through the winter…  …I’m also extending our support for English airports for a further six months.  We’re also making changes to reduce carbon emissions from aviation.  Most emissions come from international rather than domestic aviation.  So I’m introducing, from April 2023, a new ultra long haul band in Air Passenger Duty…  …covering flights of over 5,500 miles, with an economy rate of £91.  Less than 5% of passengers will pay more; but those who fly furthest will pay the most.  Corporation Tax  Madam Deputy Speaker,  Our approach to corporate taxation strikes a responsible balance between funding public services and encouraging the investment we need for a stronger economy.  At the March Budget, we took the difficult but necessary decision to increase the rate of Corporation Tax to 25% from 2023…  …still the lowest rate in the G7 and the fifth lowest rate in the G20.  Alongside, I introduced the new Super Deduction - the biggest business tax cut in modern British history.  And extended, to the end of this year, the Annual Investment Allowance at its higher level of £1m.  Now is not the time to remove tax breaks on investment.  So I can confirm today that the £1m Annual Investment Allowance will not end in December as planned… …it will be extended all the way to March 2023.  I also said in March that I would review the Bank Surcharge within Corporation Tax, to maintain the competitiveness of our financial services.  We will retain a surcharge of 3%.  The overall for corporation tax rate on banks will, in 2023, increase from 27% to 28%.  And will remain higher than the rate paid by other companies.  Small challenger banks are improving banking competition, which is good for the sector and good for consumers. So to help them, I will also raise the annual allowance to £100m.  Business Rates  Madam Deputy Speaker,  Our manifesto promised to review business rates.  We’re publishing our conclusions today.  Before I set out our plans, let me say this:  We on this side of the House are clear that reckless, unfunded promises to abolish a tax which raises £25bn every year are completely irresponsible.  It would be wrong to find £25bn in extra borrowing, cuts to public services, or tax rises elsewhere, so we will retain business rates.  But with key reforms to ease the burden and create stronger high streets.  First, we will make the business rates system fairer and timelier with more frequent revaluations every three years. The new revaluation cycle will be delivered from 2023.  Second, as called for by the Federation of Small Businesses and the British Property Federation…  …we’re introducing a new investment relief to encourage businesses to adopt green technologies like solar panels.  And I’m announcing today that we’ll accept the CBI and the British Retail Consortium’s recommendation… …to introduce a new ‘business rates improvement relief’.  From 2023, every single business will be able to make property improvements – and, for 12 months, pay no extra business rates.  That means a hotel adding extra rooms;  A manufacturer expanding their factory;  An office adding new air conditioning, CCTV or bike shelters;  Will all pay no extra rates.  Together with the new green investment relief, we’re introducing investment incentives totalling £750m.  This will make a difference, but without action millions of businesses would see their tax bills going up next year because of inflation.  I want to help those business right now, so our third step, is that next year’s planned increase in the multiplier will be cancelled.  That’s a tax cut for business worth, over the next five years, £4.6bn.  And I have one final measure to help those businesses hardest hit by the pandemic.  I’m announcing today, for one year, a new 50% business rates discount for businesses in the retail, hospitality, and leisure sectors.  Pubs, music venues, cinemas, restaurants, hotels, theatres, and gyms.  Any eligible business can claim a discount on their bills of 50%, up to a maximum of £110,000.  That is a business tax cut worth almost £1.7bn.  Together with Small Business Rates Relief, this means that over 90% of all retail, hospitality and leisure businesses will see a discount of at least 50%.  Apart from the Covid reliefs, this is the biggest single-year tax cut to business rates in 30 years.  Madam Deputy Speaker, taken together, today’s Budget cuts business rates by £7bn.  Madam Deputy Speaker,  We’re unleashing the dynamism and creativity of British businesses with a simpler, fairer, more competitive tax system.  The biggest business tax cut in modern British history.  The biggest single-year cut to business rates for 30 years.  A £1m investment allowance.  Tonnage tax – reformed. Air passenger duty – cut.  That is the way to back business and build a stronger economy.  Alcohol Duties  Madam Deputy Speaker,  Let me turn now to alcohol duties.  First introduced in 1643 to help pay for the Civil War, our alcohol duty system is outdated, complex and full of historical anomalies.  The Institute of Fiscal Studies have called it, in their words: “a mess”.  The Institute of Economic Affairs said it: “defies common sense”.  And the World Health Organisation have warned that countries like the UK which follow the EU rules are, and I quote:  “Unable to implement tax systems that are optimal from the perspective of public health”.  So, Madam Deputy Speaker,  Today, we are taking advantage of leaving the EU to announce the most radical simplification of alcohol duties for over 140 years.  We’re taking five steps today to create a system that is simpler, fairer, and healthier.  First, to radically simplify the system, we are slashing the number of main duty rates from fifteen to just six.  Our new system will be designed around a common-sense principle: the stronger the drink, the higher the rate.  This means that some drinks, like stronger red wines, fortified wines, or high-strength ‘white ciders’…  …will see a small increase in their rates because they are currently undertaxed given their strength.  That’s the right thing to do, and it will help end the era of cheap, high-strength drinks which can harm public health and enable problem drinking.  And because this is a more rational system, the converse is also true:  Many lower alcohol drinks are currently overtaxed - and have been for many decades.  Rosé, fruit ciders, liqueurs, lower strength beers and wines – today’s changes mean they will pay less.  The second step I’m taking today will encourage small, innovative craft producers:  I’m announcing proposals for a new Small Producer Relief.  This will extend the principle of the Small Brewers Relief to include – for the first time ever…  …small cidermakers and other producers making alcoholic drinks of less than 8.5% ABV.  Third, I’m going to modernise the system to reflect the way that people drink today.  Over the last decade, consumption of sparkling wines like prosecco has doubled.  English sparkling wine alone has increased almost tenfold.  It’s clear they are no longer the preserve of wealthy elites.  And they’re no stronger than still wines.  So I’m going to end the irrational duty premium of 28% that they currently pay.  Sparkling wines – wherever they are produced – will now pay the same duty as still wines of equivalent strength.  And because growing conditions in the UK typically favour lower strength and sparkling wines…  …this means English and Welsh wines, compared with stronger imported wines, will now pay less.  Sales of fruit cider have increased from one in a thousand ciders sold in 2005 to one in four today.  But they can pay two or three times as much duty as cider that is made with apples or pears.  So I’m cutting duty on them too.  The fourth step I’m taking today will directly support the home of British community life for centuries: our pubs.  Even before the pandemic, pubs were struggling: between 2000 and 2019, consumption in the on-trade fell by 40%.  And many public health bodies recognise that pubs are often safer drinking environments than being at home.  So, as the Members for Dudley South and North West Durham will agree, a fairer, healthier system supports pubs.  So, I can announce today: Draught Relief.  Draught Relief will apply a new, lower rate of duty on draught beer and cider.  It will apply to drinks served from draught containers over 40 litres.  It will particularly benefit community pubs who do 75% of their trade on draught.  And let me tell the House the new rate: Draught Relief will cut duty by 5%.  That is the biggest cut to cider duty since 1923.  The biggest cut to fruit ciders in a generation.  The biggest cut to beer duty for 50 years.  This is not temporary…  It’s a long-term investment in British pubs of £100m a year.  And a permanent cut in the cost of a pint of 3p.  Madam Deputy Speaker,  These much-needed reforms will come into effect in February 2023.  But I want to help the hospitality industry right now.  So for my final announcement on alcohol duty today, I can confirm that the planned increase in duty…  …on spirits like Scotch Whisky, wine, cider and beer, will all, from midnight tonight, be cancelled.  That’s a tax cut worth £3bn.  Madam Deputy Speaker,  Our reforms make the alcohol duty system simpler, fairer and healthier;  They help with the cost of living while tackling problem drinking;  They support innovative entrepreneurs and craft producers;  They back pubs and public health;  And they are only possible because we’ve left the EU.  Helping Families with the Cost of Living  Madam Deputy Speaker,  World class public services.  Investment in infrastructure, innovation, and skills.  Simpler, fairer taxes to support businesses and consumers.  All built on the foundation of a stronger economy and responsible public finances.  That is our vision for the future and that is what this Budget delivers.  And this Budget also supports working families.  Fuel Duty  Madam Deputy Speaker,  With fuel prices at the highest level in 8 years…  I’m not prepared to add to the squeeze on families and small businesses.  So I can confirm today: the planned rise in fuel duty will be cancelled.  That’s a saving over the next five years of nearly £8bn.  Compared to pre-2010 plans, today’s freeze means the average tank of fuel will cost…  …around £15 less per car; £30 less for vans; £130 less for HGVs.  After 12 consecutive years of frozen rates, the average car driver will now save a total of £1,900.  Pay  Madam Deputy Speaker,  I can announce today that public sector workers will see fair and affordable pay rises across the whole Spending Review period…  …as we return to the normal, independent pay-setting process.  And I can take action to help the lowest paid as well.  It was a Conservative government that introduced the National Living Wage in 2016.  A Conservative government that, according to statistics published just yesterday…  …has overseen the proportion of people in low-paid work falling to its lowest level since 1997.  And it is a Conservative government that is increasing the wage floor again today.  The independent Low Pay Commission brings together economists, business groups, and trade unions.  The Government is accepting their recommendation to increase the National Living Wage next year by 6.6%, to £9.50 an hour.  For a full-time worker, that’s a pay rise worth over £1,000.  It will benefit over 2m of the lowest-paid workers in the country.  It’s broadly consistent with previous increases and keeps us on track for our target of two thirds of median earnings by 2024.  And it is a major commitment to the high-wage, high-skill, high-productivity economy of the future.  Peroration/ UC Taper  Madam Deputy Speaker,  As we build this stronger economy, we’re doing so at the end of an extraordinary 18 months.  Covid wasn’t just a public health challenge.  It wasn’t just an economic challenge.  It was a moral challenge too.  We had to show we could pull together as a country, and we did.  We had to put aside questions of ideology and orthodoxy to do whatever it took to care for our people and each other, and we did.  There’s a different kind of moral dimension to the economic challenge we face now.  Last year, the state grew to be over half the size of the total economy.  Taxes are rising to their highest level as a % of GDP since the 1950s.  I don’t like it, but I cannot apologise for it – it’s the result of the unprecedented crisis we faced and the extraordinary action we took in response.  But now, we have a choice.  Do we want to live in a country where the response to every question is: “what is the government going to do about it”?  Where every time prices rise, every time a company gets in trouble, every time some new challenge emerges, the answer is always: the taxpayer must pay?  Or do we choose to recognise that Government has limits. That Government should have limits.  If this seems a controversial statement to make… then I’m all the more glad for saying it… because that means it needed saying… and it is what we believe.  There’s a reason we talk about the importance of family, community, and personal responsibility.  Not because these are an alternative to the market or the state…it’s because they are more important than the market or the state.  The moments that make life worth living aren’t created by government, aren’t announced by government, aren’t granted by government.  They come from us as people… our choices… our sacrifices… our efforts…  And, we believe people should keep more of the rewards of those efforts.  Yes, we’ve taken some corrective action to fund the NHS and get our debt under control.  But as we look towards the future, I want to say this simple thing to the House and the British people:  My goal is to reduce taxes.  By the end of this Parliament, I want taxes to be going down not up.  I want this to be a society that rewards energy, ingenuity and inventiveness.  A society that rewards work.  That is what we believe on this side of the House.  That is my mission over the remainder of this Parliament.  And the final announcement in today’s Budget takes a first step.  Madam Deputy Speaker,  For many of the lowest-paid in society, there is a hidden tax on work.  The Universal Credit Taper withdraws support as people work more hours.  The rate is currently 63%, so for every extra £1 someone earns, their Universal Credit is reduced by 63p.  Let us be in no doubt: this is a tax on work.  And a high rate of tax at that.  Organisations as varied as the Trades Union Congress, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation…  …the Resolution Foundation, the Centre for Policy Studies…  …and the Centre for Social Justice have all said it’s too high.  So, to make sure work pays, and help some of the lowest income families in the country keep more of their hard-earned money…  …I have decided to cut this Rate, not by 1%, not by 2% - but by 8%.  This is a tax on working people – and I’m cutting it from 63 to 55%.  The rate originally envisaged by My Right Honourable Friend the Member for Chingford.  And because I’m also increasing the Work Allowances by £500…  …this is a tax cut next year worth over £2bn.  Nearly 2 million families will keep, on average, an extra £1,000 a year.  Changes like this normally take effect at the start of the new tax year in April.  But we want to help people right now.  So we’ll introduce this within weeks, and no later than December 1st.  Let me tell the House what these changes mean:  A single mother of two, renting, and working full-time on the National Living Wage will be better off by around £1,200.  And a couple, renting a home with their two children…  …one working full-time, the other working part-time…  …will be better off, every single year, by £1,800.  This is a £2bn tax cut for the lowest-paid workers in the country.  It supports working families.  It helps with the cost of living.  And it rewards work.  So, Madam Deputy Speaker,  Fuel duty – cut.  Air passenger duty – cut.  Alcohol duty – cut.  The biggest cut to business rates in 30 years.  Growth up.  Jobs up.  Wages up.  Public finances back in a better place.  More investment in infrastructure, innovation and skills.  A pay rise for over 2 million people.  And a £2bn tax cut for the lowest paid.  This Budget helps with the cost of living.  This Budget levels up to a higher-wage, higher-skill, higher-productivity economy.  This Budget builds a stronger economy for the British people.  And I commend it to the House.",Autumn Budget and Spending Review 2021 Speech,mixture
56,340222199601518208928389011794951636825,"Ministers today (25 July 2021) pledged to cut red tape for British wine importers - saving British wine lovers up to £130m a year.  Once implemented, the change would remove the requirement for VI-1 certificates on all imports of wine into Great Britain, which means substantial savings for consumers and businesses.  The move will take away a significant burden on our wine trade, the second largest in the world in value terms. Industry analysis suggests that VI-1 certificates add 10p to every bottle of imported wine.  Removing this measure will cut red tape and ensure importing wine to Great Britain is as streamlined as possible.  Food and Drink Minister Victoria Prentis said:  The British wine industry has increasingly delivered fantastic wines at great value from all around the world.  Cutting this needless red tape will place our businesses in a stronger position internationally, as they continue to grow, while consumers can raise a glass to great wine from around the world.  Great Britain is already a global hub in the international wine trade, supporting many jobs across the country. Ending the requirement for import certificates will strengthen this position and is a clear benefit of now having the freedom to determine our own rules.  International Trade Minister Ranil Jayawardena said:  It’s fantastic that the British people will no longer have to pay for unnecessary bureaucracy when they buy a bottle of wine.  Trade is key for economic growth and levelling up the country. Through our trade deals, we are making it easier for British consumers to access to top-quality products from around the world – including wine – and we are bringing down foreign trade barriers to open up even more opportunities for British businesses to succeed overseas.  Industry analysis suggests that this move will ultimately reduce the cost of wine for consumers. This will mean that wine drinkers around the country will be able to enjoy the same high-quality products from across the world at a cheaper price - on average 10p per wine bottle imported into GB.",Red tape cut for wine imports to save British wine lovers £130m a year,mixture

This week we have been subjected to a barrage of grim warnings about the crisis that is beginning to engulf the NHS in the wake of the pandemic.  Overstretched, short-staffed and underfunded, the health service is said to be facing the worst winter in its history, according to NHS Providers, which represents bodies such as hospital trusts and the ambulance service.  Predictably, this chorus of anguish has been taken up most notably by the BBC, whose own dependence on public funding gives it a vested interest in defending another arm of the State.  Indeed, the Corporation often seems only too keen to act as a voice of propaganda for the NHS, peddling scare stories about its supposed lack of resources while simultaneously praising the magnificence of its workforce.  Despair  That has been the pattern again in recent days.  On Monday morning, BBC Radio 5 Live was dominated by discussion about the looming winter crisis, complete with the usual paeans of praise for its fortitude, juxtaposed with despair at its failings born of cheeseparing.  More of the same followed on Radio 4, where the Today programme is focusing on the NHS and its future. Yesterday it was the experience of the NHS in Newcastle.  From there, health editor Hugh Pym said that for local hospitals 'every week seems more hectic than the last one', adding that 'the strain will get even more intense'.  Presenter Martha Kearney spoke of 'hospitals beyond full stretch', a theme eagerly taken up by Chris Hopson (pictured), the chief executive of NHS Providers  Presenter Martha Kearney spoke of 'hospitals beyond full stretch', a theme eagerly taken up by Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers.  In his interview with her, he wailed that staff are 'running at full pelt' but left exhausted 'by insufficient capacity'.  The NHS is now paying the price, he explained, for 'a broken workforce model' and 'the longest and deepest financial squeeze in our history' over the past decade.  This brings us to the nub of the issue. With the BBC acting as collaborators, NHS managers are indulging in a crude form of political blackmail.  Presenter Martha Kearney (pictured) spoke of 'hospitals beyond full stretch'  The aim of all this shroud-waving is clearly to compel the Government to inject yet more money into the NHS.  This approach has already proved effective, with record sums being handed to our beleaguered health service.  Incredibly, 40 per cent of all budgeted day-to-day spending by the State now goes to the health sector. And this trend is set to be accelerated when the Government's 1.25 per cent National Insurance hike takes effect in April, generating an extra £12 billion a year for health and social care.  In his Budget last month, the Chancellor also promised another £6 billion to clear the Covid backlog.  Yet if there is one thing we know about the NHS, it is that whatever the sums involved, they are never enough. The NHS seems permanently on the verge of meltdown.  In his Budget last month, the Chancellor (pictured) also promised another £6 billion to clear the Covid backlog  But it is this perpetual talk of doom that makes me so sceptical. I have been working in the NHS for 35 years and, as far as I recall, every coming winter has been hailed as likely to be the 'worst ever'.  In fact, the proclamation of inevitable disaster is almost a traditional pre-Christmas ritual, undimmed by reality.  Nigel Lawson, a Tory Chancellor for six years in the 1980s, said the NHS was the closest thing the English people had to a religion — and the prospect of a Biblical-scale apocalypse features heavily in the vision shared by the most fervent adherents of this faith.  But there is no justification for panic. The impact of Covid is being cynically exaggerated for political ends, an approach epitomised by a statement from the new NHS chief executive, Amanda Pritchard.  A week ago, having claimed the NHS is 'running hot' with 'very real pressures on health and social care', she said: 'We have had 14 times the number of people with Covid in hospital than we saw this time last year.'  . The impact of Covid is being cynically exaggerated for political ends, an approach epitomised by a statement from the new NHS chief executive, Amanda Pritchard (pictured)  In fact, the number of people in hospital with coronavirus was far lower than at the same time last year.  When she spoke last week, there were 7,075 patients in English hospitals with Covid-19, compared with 11,680 on November 8, 2020.  NHS England later clarified that Pritchard had been referring to admissions in August 2021, the most recent set of published monthly figures, which were 22,877, compared with 1,629 in August last year.  But Ms Pritchard's highly selective use of outdated figures went completely unchallenged by the BBC.  Equally unconvincing is the theory that a surge in Covid cases is set to overwhelm the NHS — a threat Boris Johnson talked up at his press conference on Monday, with reference to 'storm clouds'.  Decline  Such language is badly misplaced. The worst of the Covid pandemic is behind us, as deaths continue to decline and the vaccine programme extends its reach.  Nor do I believe there is any basis for anxiety about the threat from a new wave of flu.  Those who shriek about the 'worst winter ever' should recall 1957, when the Asian flu outbreak killed 33,000 people in the UK; and the Hong Kong flu epidemic of 1968, which accounted for 80,000 lives.  Yet the NHS coped then, and will do so again.  The worst of the Covid pandemic is behind us, as deaths continue to decline and the vaccine programme extends its reach (stock image)  Paradoxically, the advent of Covid has actually made life easier for the health service in one respect: by encouraging a far higher take-up of the flu vaccine, particularly among those aged over 65.  As a result of this — and more hand-washing, wearing of face masks and social distancing — influenza rates have tumbled in Britain since the coronavirus outbreak.  According to government figures, there were only nine hospital admissions in England last winter for flu, compared with 1,671 in 2019/20.  One analysis by Public Health England found there were no flu cases detected at all between December 28, 2020, and February 14, 2021.  One analysis by Public Health England found there were no flu cases detected at all between December 28, 2020, and February 14, 2021 (stock image)  Alarmism  Even if there is a small rise this winter, it is unlikely that influenza will return to anything like pre-Covid levels, when in a bad year it could kill around 30,000 people.  Yes, hospitals face a backlog of operations built up during the period when the NHS became the National Covid Service. But while delaying operations such as cancer surgery is not an option, some elective procedures will just have to be postponed until the spring, because it is impossible to carry on completely as normal at a time of national emergency.  One of the worst aspects of the current alarmism is how it will be used to block reform in the NHS. Buttressed by sentimentality and BBC cheerleading, the health service pretends its problems can only ever be solved by more money.  But the truth is, extra funding can actually worsen its inadequacies by entrenching the interests of its workforce over its patients and perpetuating flawed structures, sprawling bureaucracies and chronic inefficiencies.  We could do so much better if the blind NHS-worship and incessant gloom-mongering were dropped. The cycle of manufactured crisis only lowers staff morale, leaves the public fearful and inhibits the drive for vital change.

58,94523179572867416180887462371886856030,"Worldwide analysis of 188 nations shows a massive global correlation between vaccination and higher case rates of Covid-19, proving the world is currently experiencing a pandemic of the vaccinated.  METHOD  Data was analysed from the ‘Our World in Data’ site of Johns Hopkins University on 247 million Covid-19 cases from the very start of the pandemic to October 31st 2021, for all 188 nations where they have data on both the percentage of people vaccinated and the cumulative confirmed cases per million .  The results on the average cases per million people against the percentage vaccinated were as follows –  CONCLUSION  The above shows that the incidence of cases increases fairly linearly with the percentage of vaccinated people at a rate of 800 cases per million per extra percentage vaccinated.  The nations with the lowest case rates are almost exclusively in Africa, which also has the lowest rates of vaccination.  Whereas the nations with the highest case rates also have the highest rates of vaccination.  The inescapable conclusion from all the data we have up to October 31st is that vaccines increase case numbers. This is not a representative sample of a few thousand cases from one nation. It is a full study of all the cases so far in every reporting nation.  The results are in. There is a massive correlation positive between vaccination percentage and case numbers. Vaccinations are clearly opening the door to the virus.  In heavily vaccinated nations such as the UK the case rate in the fully vaccinated over 30’s is presently only 23-55% higher than the case rate in the unvaccinated. But the case rate in the unvaccinated is elevated due to infection by vaccinated people.  The media narrative is that the unvaccinated are infecting the vaccinated. This data indisputably shows that the reverse is the case. This has now become a pandemic of the vaccinated.  They are increasing the case numbers in the unvaccinated – because their immune systems are being damaged by the vaccines. That is what the fairly straight and very steep line above is declaring.  Had there been no vaccination in the UK the figures would now be more like those of the African countries as seen in the bottom left of the above graph.  One of the clearest ways to see that the vaccinated are infecting the unvaccinated is the comparison of 71% vaccinated in Israel with 27% vaccinated in Palestine.  The graph shows Israel leading Palestine in cases and dragging them up above the world average case level.  Worldwide analysis of 188 nations shows a massive global correlation between vaccination and higher case rates of Covid-19, proving the world is currently experiencing a pandemic of the vaccinated.

For your consideration: a story and outcome you probably aren't hearing much about anywhere else. It takes place in the heart of Amish country.  Lancaster County, Pennsylvania: thousands of families lead lives largely separate from modern America.  The Amish are a Christian group that emphasizes the virtuous over the superficial. They don’t usually drive, use electricity, or have TVs. And during the Covid-19 outbreak, they became subjects in a massive social and medical experiment.  Sharyl: So, it's safe to say there was a whole different approach here in this community when coronavirus broke out than many other places?  Calvin Lapp: Absolutely.  Calvin Lapp is Amish Mennonite.  Lapp: There’s three things the Amish don't like. And that's government— they won't get involved in the government, they don't like the public education system— they won't send their children to education, and they also don't like the health system. They rip us off. Those are three things that we feel like we're fighting against all the time. Well, those three things are all part of what Covid is.  After a short shutdown last year, the Amish chose a unique path that led to Covid-19 tearing through at warp speed. It began with an important religious holiday in May.  Lapp: When they take communion, they dump their wine into a cup and they take turns to drink out of that cup. So, you go the whole way down the line, and everybody drinks out of that cup, if one person has coronavirus, the rest of church is going to get coronavirus. The first time they went back to church, everybody got coronavirus.  Lapp says they weren’t denying coronavirus, they were facing it head on.  Lapp: It’s a worse thing to quit working than dying. Working is more important than dying. But to shut down and say that we can't go to church, we can't get together with family, we can't see our old people in the hospital, we got to quit working? It's going completely against everything that we believe. You're changing our culture completely to try to act like they wanted us to act the last year, and we're not going to do it.  Steve Nolt is a scholar on Amish and Mennonite culture, and Mennonite himself. He’s studying Amish news publications to analyze community-wide trends.  Sharyl: So, are you saying, as of about May of 2020, things kind of went back to normal in the Amish community?  Steve Nolt: For the most part, yeah, by the middle of May, it's sort of like back to a typical behavior again.  That also meant avoiding hospitals.  Nolt: I know of some cases in which Amish people refused to go to the hospital, even when they were very sick because if they went there, they wouldn't be able to have visitors. And it was more important to be sick, even very sick at home and have the ability to have some people around you than to go to the hospital and be isolated.  Then, last March, remarkable news. The Lancaster County Amish were reported to be the first community to achieve “herd immunity,” meaning a large part of a population had been infected with Covid-19 and became immune.  Some outsiders are skeptical, and solid proof is hard to come by.  Nolt: Even those who believed that they had Covid tended not to get tested. Their approach tended to be, “I'm sick. I know I'm sick. I don't have to have someone else telling me I'm sick.” Or a concern that if they got a positive test, they would then be asked to really dramatically limit what they were doing in a way that might be uncomfortable for them. So, we don't have that testing number.  Lapp: We didn't want the numbers to go up, because then they would shut things more. What's the advantage of getting a test?  One thing’s clear: there's no evidence of any more deaths among the Amish than in places that shut down tight— some claim there were fewer here. That’s without masking, staying at home, or another important measure.  Sharyl: Did most of the community, at least the adults, get the Covid-19 vaccine?  Nolt: Again, we don't have data on that, but I think it's pretty clear that in percentage terms, relatively few did.  Lapp: Oh, we're glad all the English people got their Covid vaccines. That's great. Because now we don't have to wear a mask, we can do what we want. So good for you. Thank you. We appreciate it. Us? No, we're not getting vaccines. Of course not. We all got the Covid, so why would you get a vaccine?  By staying open, the Amish here have one tangible 2020 accomplishment few others can claim.  Lapp: We have this joke: when everybody else started walking, we started running. We made more money in the last year than we ever did. It was our best year ever.  Did the Amish really find a magic formula? They say yes. And they don’t care who doubts it.  Lapp: Yeah, all the Amish know we got herd immunity. Of course we got herd immunity! The whole church gets coronavirus. We know we got coronavirus. We think we’re smarter than everybody. We shouldn’t be bragging, but we think we did the right thing.  Sharyl (on-camera): Nolt, the scholar, is publishing a paper on the Amish social response to government mandates and Covid-19.",Amish Covid,other

Photo: Sarah Reingewirtz, Los Angeles Daily News/SCNG  The kids are safe. They always have been.  It may sound strange, given a year of panic over school closures and reopenings, a year of masking toddlers and closing playgrounds and huddling in pandemic pods, that, according to the CDC, among children the mortality risk from COVID-19 is actually lower than from the flu. The risk of severe disease or hospitalization is about the same.  This is true for the much-worried-over Delta variant. It is also true for all the other variants, and for the original strain. Most remarkably, it has been known to be true since the very earliest days of the pandemic — indeed it was among the very first things we did know about the disease. The preliminary mortality data from China was very clear: To children, COVID-19 represented only a vanishingly tiny threat of death, hospitalization, or severe disease.  Yet for a year and a half we have been largely unwilling to fully believe it. Children now wear masks at little-league games, and at the swimming pool, and when school reopens in the fall they will likely wear masks there, too. But the kids are not at risk themselves, and never were. Now, thanks to vaccines, the vast majority of their parents and grandparents aren’t any longer, either.  But first: the kids. Over the course of the pandemic, 49,000 Americans under the age of 18 have died of all causes, according to the CDC. Only 331 of those deaths have been from COVID — less than half as many as have died of pneumonia. In 2019, more than 2,000 American kids and teenagers died in car crashes; each year, according to some estimates, about a thousand die from drowning.  Some of these comparisons aren’t so neat, since the data on other diseases and accidents are sometimes unreliable, and because the extraordinary precautions against COVID-19 probably prevented significant additional spread (and also suppressed the spread of other diseases). But, last year, fewer kids died of COVID-19 than of heart disease, “malignant neopolasms,” suicide, and homicide — not to mention birth defects, which killed hundreds of times more. All told, 600,000 Americans have lost their lives to COVID over the course of the pandemic; just 0.05 percent of those were under the age of 18, a population that represents more than 20 percent of the country’s population as a whole.  Risk is a tricky thing, the spread of the Delta variant and the complications of “long COVID” both real concerns, and all parents should assess their own comfort, and those of their children, in making plans and taking precautions. But very few of them, two summers ago, were sending their children to parks and pools and camps in masks out of fear of pneumonia or flu. Probably fewer were keeping them home entirely.  This summer, the calculations are very different than they were even last year, when the virus was still spreading wildly in an entirely unvaccinated population. That’s because, in the depths of a pandemic as we were then, individuals are not just individuals but links in a chain of transmission, which is the main reason why, for much of the last 18 months, public-health officials have worried over infections in the young — assuming they would eventually help bring the disease back to those much more vulnerable.  In fact, for all the consternation that the United States responded to the pandemic by abandoning individuals to fend for themselves — a narrative belied by the data, which shows a roughly average level of stringency in our public response and a remarkably generous level of social-welfare spending, as Alex Tabarrok, among others, has noted — this principle of universal and shared burden has guided an enormous amount of our pandemic response: We have treated the disease almost as a uniform threat as a way of encouraging uniform vigilance. The best way to stop deaths was to stop cases, went the thinking, which dovetailed naturally with every parent’s intuitive caution and desire to keep their kids healthy and uninfected — and distrust, perhaps, of anyone who suggested that your child would be fine if she got sick. But whatever we told ourselves in doing so, we didn’t pull those kids out of school and put them in masks for their own. We did it for the sake of others.  But on that point mass vaccination in the United States has utterly changed the landscape of the pandemic: not only by protecting those who have received shots, indeed astonishingly well, but by changing the calculus for all those who haven’t, by eliminating almost all of the mortality risk of the population at large. All told, 80 percent of American deaths have been among those 65 and above. According to the White House, 90 percent of American seniors are now fully vaccinated. Which means that while more cases are likely and some amount of hospitalization and death, as well, vaccines have eliminated the overwhelming share of American mortality risk, with the disease now circulating almost exclusively among people who can endure it much, much better — kids especially.  The country’s whole risk profile has changed. But our intuitions about risk tolerance haven’t — at least not yet.  Vaccines have been, in this way, a double gift, at least to the corners of the wealthy world where vaccination has been widespread. The first gift is the most obvious one, the power of conferred immunity, whose strength and durability continues to impress — especially against new variants, and especially in protecting against hospitalization and severe disease. From the early days of the pandemic, we were warned that immunity might quickly wane, and as soon as the vaccines arrived we learned to fear new variants that could evade their protection. Mercifully, as worrying as the spread of Delta is — and it is, making rapid inroads among the unvaccinated — neither scary possibility has come to pass. These vaccines really do work, amazingly well.  But the second gift may be more profound: the way our collective vulnerability has been transformed by vaccination programs focused on the old. The scale of this impact reflects the still under-appreciated fact of the age skew of COVID-19 — even by those who know, vaguely, that the older are more vulnerable. The important question is: How much more vulnerable? According to the CDC, the mortality risk for those 85 and above is 610 times higher than for 18-29 year olds. The number is so large it is almost hard to process. If a given number of infections among 20-somethings would produce just a single fatality, the same number of infections in 85-year-olds would produce 610. Of all the risk factors and comorbidities we read and heard so much about last spring, from race and class to obesity and COPD, each of which should raise ringing alarm bells about inequities in our society and our health system, the effect of age absolutely dwarfs all of them. Somehow, we could barely hear that alarm bell in the panicked pandemic din.  And though the skew is most visible among the very old, the effect is consistent across all age groups, with mortality risk doubling every five years. This means every difference of two decades multiplies risk 16-fold. Three decades and the difference is 64-fold. Those aged 75-84 face a mortality risk from the disease 230 times higher than those in their twenties. Between 65 and 74 you are 95 times more likely to die from a COVID infection than the CDC’s 20-something baseline reference group.  And the risk of children is dramatically smaller still than that CDC baseline; according to one, much-cited paper, the infection fatality rate for those aged 5 to 9 is less than 0.001 percent. It suggests that a child of that age, even sick, faces roughly one-ten-thousandth the mortality risk of an 85-year-old. Statistically speaking, if a kid who comes down with a coronavirus infection is facing a threat to her life equivalent to the flu — perhaps significantly less — a 90-year-old who does so is treading in the neighborhood of anthrax, the bubonic plague, and certain lighter outbreaks of Ebola. It was often said, in lamentations of American indifference at the outset of the pandemic, that the country would have taken the disease much more seriously if it hadn’t spared the very young. In the year that followed, we mostly pretended it didn’t.  A large new study from the U.K. examining the fatality rate among all those under 18 found it only fractionally higher there — 0.005 percent. Overall, 126,000 Brits have died of COVID since the onset of the pandemic; just 26 of those were under the age of 18. Death is not the only scary outcome of COVID-19 infection, of course, and hospitalizations don’t skew quite as dramatically as mortality. But an 85-year-old is still, according to the CDC, 15 times likelier to be hospitalized from COVID than a 20-something, who is many times more likely to need that care than a child. Did you know that the WHO doesn’t even recommend universal mask-wearing for kids younger than 12?  None of this is new, and, scientifically, none of it was ever disputed, not even during the bitterest and most intense of last year’s fights over pandemic policy. Nobody was debating the risk of severe disease in children — in fact whenever a Republican governor, speaking of school kids, made the comparison to the flu, media organizations would dispatch fact-checkers who invariably returned a verdict of “mostly true.” What scientists were debating instead was transmission rates — whether children could catch the disease, or spread it, as readily as adults, especially in the classroom settings that became the focal point of the fight.  Studies on these questions have returned a variety of divergent answers, a sign of how complicated it can be to unpack the effects of one variable (like in-classroom learning) from others (local mask-wearing, seroprevalence, rates of social mixing versus social distancing). But one recent eye-opening report was recently highlighted in Nature. Among 900,000 in-school pupils learning in North Carolina last fall, researchers would have expected, based on local transmission rates, about 900 cases of COVID. There were, it turned out, only 23. In another study, among 20,000 Nebraska students attending school all year there were, in total, two cases. Even if the numbers were higher, the risk would not have been borne by the kids themselves, but their grandparents and other more vulnerable members of the community — of whom there are many fewer now, thanks to vaccines.  What about the unvaccinated elderly? In truth, there are very few places in the United States with very many of them — that is what it means to have a national vaccination rate of 90 percent for seniors. Zoom in closer, though, and it’s still hard to find areas of real concern. No state has administered at least one shot of vaccine to less than 76 percent of its over-65 population. Though there are some counties with rates of elderly vaccination below 50 percent, there aren’t too many. At the state level, all but three states have reached 80 percent of their elderly population, and three states (Hawaii, Pennsylvania, and Vermont) have passed 99 percent. It would be better, of course, if every state were at that level — and if every senior who’d gotten one shot went ahead and got a second. But for all the anxiety about low vaccination rates both in the country as a whole (where only 47 percent of the country has been fully vaccinated) and particular pockets of vaccine resistance or skepticism (in Mississippi, the figure is 36 percent), almost everywhere you look the most vulnerable populations are quite well-covered.  How much protection is it, though? The vaccines aren’t perfect, and there have been breakthrough infections, though those are to be expected. The Delta variant — which looks considerably more transmissible across the general population, but does not appear to be more dangerous to those infected — has not, despite all the angst, demonstrated in the fully vaccinated signs of dramatic immune escape or meaningfully diminished vaccine efficacy. (If you’ve only gotten one dose, you are likely more vulnerable.) The result is that while we are seeing some new cases, including among the vaccinated, those cases are, while concerning, considerably less concerning than they would have been six or nine months ago. In Singapore, 100 percent of cases in vaccinated people are, reportedly, mild or asymptomatic. In a study conducted in a Rhode Island prison, only a tiny fraction of fully-dosed prisoners tested positive and all of those positive cases were asymptomatic. (To cite just two studies in a robust growing literature showing the mildness of post-vaccine infections.)  Hanging over all of this is the cloud of long COVID, but precisely how large a cloud — and how darkly it shadows over children in particular — remains very much an open question. The prospect of enduring, sometimes debilitating sickness is, of course, a legitimate concern, for individuals of any age, not just kids. But the reporting has often been anecdotal and studies aiming to document its prevalence have often been so filled with methodological problems — small sample sizes, self-reporting, no non-COVID comparison groups — it’s not easy to know which results to trust.  In the U.S., Peter Hotez of Baylor has warned that low mortality rates among children are misleading because severe initial illness might be just the “tip of the iceberg” of the country’s long-term coronavirus problem. Certain surveys have shown some alarming numbers, but those finding long COVID in roughly a third or even half of the infected are almost certainly overestimates, and those suggesting 10 percent may well be, too — since some of the symptoms being counted show up at the same rates among those who never got COVID. One large, much-referred-to survey in the U.K. found that between 7 and 9 percent of children who got sick were suffering from at least one symptom some months on, though the same survey also suggested the relative burden of long COVID in children was much smaller than in adults — of about one million people in the country complaining of long-term symptoms, only 3 percent, or 33,000, were kids, who make up more than a fifth of the country’s population.  Another, perhaps more rigorous recent study in pre-print, looking at NHS data in the U.K., found that among more than one million patients diagnosed with COVID, only 3,000 registered long COVID — well under one percent. We don’t yet have anything like that scale of study considering similar cases in American kids, but a subset of long-COVID research linking the severity of disease to the likelihood of enduring symptoms implies that the risk may be considerably smaller in children than in the population at large.  All of this suggests that, given American vaccination rates and the age skew of the disease, we might stop worrying so much about cases — stop treating them as a proxy for the severity of the pandemic at any time, and stop believing they tell us something obvious about near-future deaths. In countries like this one, with mass vaccination of the elderly already behind us, we could track the course of the disease instead through hospitalizations or deaths, which now have a very different relationship to case numbers than they did a year ago. When we built our mental models of the pandemic last spring and summer, a certain number of new cases told us one kind of story, and we learned to extrapolate from a certain rising rate of case growth an inevitable rise in death rates a few weeks later. But we are living in a very different world now, in which both the lion’s share of mortality risk has been eliminated through vaccination targeted at the elderly, and in which a much larger share of the ongoing transmission of the disease is producing much milder cases.  In the rest of the world, where vaccination rates are much lower and the elderly remain very much at risk, of course, the pandemic looks much more like it did a year ago, indeed even scarier given how much more transmissible Delta is. This is another reason, if we needed one, to be outraged at the geopolitics of vaccines: protecting the vulnerable in those countries could be done efficiently, too. Many countries in the developing world don’t need 80 percent of their populations vaccinated to eliminate the lion’s share of their own mortality risk, but just a fraction of that — often, due to the age structure of those populations, a much smaller fraction than was required to do it here in the U.S.  In parts of Europe where the vaccination rates remain low, near-vertical rates of case growth, driven by Delta, remain concerning; case growth elsewhere in the world, likely more so. But in the well-vaccinated U.K., where the rise of the Delta variant has generated widespread anxiety about a national “reopening” scheduled for July 19, the ratio of case growth to hospitalization rates has fallen more than fivefold. The infection fatality rate has fallen perhaps 20-fold and, even focusing just on Delta, at least tenfold: to 0.2 percent compared with 1.9 percent for the original, “Alpha” strain. Which helps explain why, even amidst widespread worry about flatlining vaccination rates and rapid spread of Delta, there are now those, like Amesh Adalja of Johns Hopkins, taking the opportunity to mark “the end of the acute phase of the public health emergency in this country,” and others, like Monica Gandhi of University of California, San Francisco, suggesting, reasonably, we might think about downgrading from “epidemic” to “endemic.”  In the U.K., even the University of Edinburgh’s Devi Sridhar, long the country’s most vocal advocate for a no-tolerance, total-suppression approach known as “zero COVID,” has lately been wondering, “Can we now live with the coronavirus?”  A few months ago, a wave of articles and essays appeared reconsidering the pandemic with the benefit of a year’s vantage, and focusing on the matter of aerosol spread. Namely, the fact that it took public-health authorities, in the U.S. and around the world, an excruciatingly long time to recognize and then publicize that the coronavirus spread primarily through the air — and not just through large droplets produced by sneezing and coughing, but small droplets produced by breathing. This was a major failing, especially when the science became clear to those looking closely — not immediately, but within the first few months.  But in my view, the basic disregard for the age skew of the disease looks in retrospect like the bigger oversight, in part because there was no scientific dispute. And still, painfully little was done to address it in policy. “Shouldn’t we have been celebrating the fact that it doesn’t affect children that much?” Gandhi asked me. “Like, shouldn’t that be something that we celebrate? I mean, it is kind of weird. You just have to look at the CDC websites to see that kids are not very much at risk.”  I first wrote about the subject early last May, in an essay with the headline “COVID-19 Targets the Elderly. Why Don’t Our Prevention Efforts?” At the time, I was told, by many people who’d know better than me, that the country simply lacked the capacity to meaningfully protect the elderly during the first spring wave — a mark both of how casually we disregard the humanity of the country’s old and how poorly prepared we were to scale up medical production and provide tests and PPE to those who could benefit the most from them.  The argument grew less plausible by summer, when the U.S. was basically leading the world in testing and had already produced a stockpile of unused rapid tests that could’ve been deployed in nursing homes and other eldercare facilities, and when the federal government could’ve easily been mailing such tests (and masks) to everyone on the AARP mailing list. It grew even less so last fall and winter, when, despite how you may remember the course of the disease, the majority of American deaths actually occurred. By that point, almost certainly, a program launched in the spring, with the expectation of a second or third wave, could have been offering considerable at-home support for the elderly who hoped to self-isolate, or at least limit their contact with those they couldn’t trust were COVID-negative.  It wasn’t until this spring, even, that an easy-to-use, COVID-risk calculator appeared — this one, on The Economist’s website. For a while, at the beginning of the pandemic, the age skew of the disease was treated as a form of COVID-denier, right-wing propaganda — as though the inevitable implication was indifference towards deaths among the very old. But only a sociopath would draw that conclusion, as opposed to its opposite: that a portion of the American public desperately needed support and protection. By and large, they didn’t get it. Even given the age skew of the disease, the average number of years of life lost by those who have died from COVID-19 was 16.  So what does this mean for the remainder of the pandemic? First, we should do what we can to actually, finally, process the basic, astounding fact of the pandemic age skew — to try to put aside our reflex to shield children from any threat of infection, to put aside the additional fear we’ve all felt, all year, because of the simple novelty of this disease, and to instead endeavor to see clearly the real scale of the direct threat to kids, which is and always has been minimal.  Second, we should try to understand just what mass vaccination of the elderly really means for the rest of us — that it dramatically limits, if not quite eradicates, the possibility of collateral damage from any present infections in the relatively young and healthy. Rather than worrying whether “vaccines alone” will stop community transmission, we should adjust our understanding of what community transmission means, in a country, like ours, with perhaps one-tenth the mortality risk it had a year ago.  And third, we should channel those feelings of mutual obligation, which governed so much of our pandemic behavior over the last 18 months, less into the project of stopping transmissions than vaccinating more and more Americans, to bring the possibility of that collateral damage close to zero. Until we do, there will be some latent mortality risk out there, which means the possibility of more deaths when the disease spreads. But it is simply a different scale of collective risk than we were facing at any point last year. If you want to keep your kids at home, or in their pods, or in their masks, that is up to you — but it is up to you, because the science is quite clear. And if you’ve spent the last months enraged at vaccine skeptics and their effect on the national immunity level, know that focusing on the need to protect children for their own sake is a form of risk-of-harm inflation, too — if one with considerably less collateral damage at stake.  Lastly, we should understand that, even without new vaccination momentum, the pandemic really has reached its final chapter here in the U.S., at least when it comes to coronavirus deaths. We are not going to reach herd immunity, at least anytime soon, which means that there will continue to be not just cases but hospitalizations and deaths — which the vaccinated will likely regard, cruelly, as a form of partisan comeuppance. But how many will there be? A few weeks ago, when reports circulated that the global COVID-19 death toll this year had already surpassed last year’s total, the fact was largely attributed to the horrific, short-sighted, painfully slow developing-world rollout of vaccines hoarded in the global North. I thought to myself, at the time, the U.S. wasn’t far off that distressing benchmark, having tabulated 350,000 official COVID deaths in 2020, and about 250,000 in 2021. If the fall was anything like last fall, when the country saw roughly 25,000 deaths each month from August through October, about 40,000 in November and about 80,000 in December, it would be easy to imagine our 2021 total surpassing last year’s — even if those numbers were cut in half, the country would still top last year’s total this year.  Thankfully, barring major surprises, it won’t — there just aren’t enough vulnerable people left. Which means it’s not just the vaccinated who can breathe easier, now, but their kids and grandkids, too.  An earlier version of this story compared one estimate of the infection fatality rate of COVID-19 with another estimate of the case fatality rate of the flu without noting the distinction. It was also edited to remove a comparison to RSV.",The Kids Were Safe From COVID the Whole Time,mixture
61,81557757968091227409093030375865188805,"In August 2020, we wrote about Bill Gates after an unearthed video showed him talking about using new vaccines for population control. However, it didn’t take long before the fact-checkers called the video misinformation and fake news.  Fast forward a little over a year later, AP now confirmed the existence of the video. In a piece titled, “Bill Gates said health care and vaccines could reduce unsustainable population growth in a 2010 TED Talk, fact-checkers say,” Reuters, the Associated Press, and FactCheck.org, now confirmed what we’ve been saying all along.  Here is how Reuters explained the story:  “Gates was referring to the reduction of population growth, not the reduction of the population by 10 or 15%.”  The Associated Press describes it this way:  “The billionaire philanthropist has spoken about the benefits of slowing the rate of population growth, but he has not advocated killing people.”  But what did Bill Gates really say? At a 2010 TED Talk about reducing carbon emissions, Gates said that one of the factors contributing to high levels of carbon emissions is population growth and that better health care could help lower unsustainable population growth.  Gates said in a 2010 TED Talk “Innovating to zero!” that improving public health using vaccinations can reduce unsustainable population growth, and with it, lower carbon emissions.” Gates’ remark was part of a larger strategy to slow down population growth in order to reduce CO2 emissions. During the 2010 TED talk presentation, Gates also shared a mathematical formula that he believes could one day solve the climate change problem we are facing.  CO2 (carbon dioxide output) = P x S x E x C (= People x Services per Person x Energy per Service x CO2 per unit of Energy).  Looking at this from a larger context of the speech, Gates is talking about the need to reduce CO2 emissions by humans and he presents this formula for calculating how big these emissions are. Gates’s formula supports the mathematical rule that to get something to zero by multiplying you have to multiply it by zero.  The “P” in the formula stands for People. Gates is advocating for a reduction in the number of people on the planet “by, perhaps, 10 or 15 percent using new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services. Rather than misrepresent what Mr. Gates said and take him out of context, below is the entire video and exact quotes from Mr. Gates.  “First, we’ve got population. The world today has 6.8 billion people. That’s headed up to about nine billion. Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by, perhaps, 10 or 15 percent …”  Could this probably explain why Bill Gates and his foundation have spent $4.3 billion to vaccinate 80 million children in third world countries? Shouldn’t sufficient food supply and clean drinking water be the first priority? What good is a healthy immune system if you’re going to die of starvation or be poisoned by your water?  Some experts object to Gates’s mathematical formula. For example, Professor Hans Rosling shows that people living in poverty have many children. Poor families suffer from high child mortality, and the largest population growth occurs where people are poor. He said saving poor children is an important factor in ending both poverty and population growth. He went on to say that the death of children is not holding back population growth. It is one of the reasons poor people still have many children.  Below is a video of Bill Gates’s presentation in 2010. Watch and listen to the video very carefully and draw your own conclusion.

And that might seem a bit surprising, because my full-time work at the foundation is mostly about vaccines and seeds, about the things that we need to invent and deliver to help the poorest two billion live better lives. But energy and climate are extremely important to these people; in fact, more important than to anyone else on the planet. The climate getting worse means that many years, their crops won’t grow: there will be too much rain, not enough rain; things will change in ways their fragile environment simply can’t support. And that leads to starvation, it leads to uncertainty, it leads to unrest. So, the climate changes will be terrible for them.  00:56  Also, the price of energy is very important to them. In fact, if you could pick just one thing to lower the price of to reduce poverty, by far you would pick energy. Now, the price of energy has come down over time. Really advanced civilization is based on advances in energy. The coal revolution fueled the Industrial Revolution, and, even in the 1900s, we’ve seen a very rapid decline in the price of electricity, and that’s why we have refrigerators, air-conditioning; we can make modern materials and do so many things. And so, we’re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world. But as we make it cheaper — and let’s say, let’s go for making it twice as cheap — we need to meet a new constraint, and that constraint has to do with CO2.  01:54  CO2 is warming the planet, and the equation on CO2 is actually a very straightforward one. If you sum up the CO2 that gets emitted, that leads to a temperature increase, and that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects: the effects on the weather; perhaps worse, the indirect effects, in that the natural ecosystems can’t adjust to these rapid changes, and so you get ecosystem collapses.  02:24  Now, the exact amount of how you map from a certain increase of CO2 to what temperature will be, and where the positive feedbacks are — there’s some uncertainty there, but not very much. And there’s certainly uncertainty about how bad those effects will be, but they will be extremely bad. I asked the top scientists on this several times: Do we really have to get down to near zero? Can’t we just cut it in half or a quarter? And the answer is, until we get near to zero, the temperature will continue to rise. And so that’s a big challenge. It’s very different than saying, “We’re a twelve-foot-high truck trying to get under a ten-foot bridge, and we can just sort of squeeze under.” This is something that has to get to zero.  03:11  Now, we put out a lot of carbon dioxide every year — over 26 billion tons. For each American, it’s about 20 tons. For people in poor countries, it’s less than one ton. It’s an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet. And somehow, we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero. It’s been constantly going up. It’s only various economic changes that have even flattened it at all, so we have to go from rapidly rising to falling, and falling all the way to zero.  03:45  This equation has four factors, a little bit of multiplication. So you’ve got a thing on the left, CO2, that you want to get to zero, and that’s going to be based on the number of people, the services each person is using on average, the energy, on average, for each service, and the CO2 being put out per unit of energy. So let’s look at each one of these, and see how we can get this down to zero. Probably, one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero.  04:16  (Laughter)  04:17  That’s back from high school algebra. But let’s take a look.  04:21  First, we’ve got population. The world today has 6.8 billion people. That’s headed up to about nine billion. Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by, perhaps, 10 or 15 percent. But there, we see an increase of about 1.3.  04:42  The second factor is the services we use. This encompasses everything: the food we eat, clothing, TV, heating. These are very good things. Getting rid of poverty means providing these services to almost everyone on the planet. And it’s a great thing for this number to go up. In the rich world, perhaps the top one billion, we probably could cut back and use less, but every year, this number, on average, is going to go up, and so, overall, that will more than double the services delivered per person. Here we have a very basic service: Do you have lighting in your house to be able to read your homework? And, in fact, these kids don’t, so they’re going out and reading their schoolwork under the street lamps.  05:30  Now, efficiency, “E,” the energy for each service — here, finally we have some good news. We have something that’s not going up. Through various inventions and new ways of doing lighting, through different types of cars, different ways of building buildings — there are a lot of services where you can bring the energy for that service down quite substantially. Some individual services even bring it down by 90 percent. There are other services, like how we make fertilizer, or how we do air transport, where the rooms for improvement are far, far less. And so overall, if we’re optimistic, we may get a reduction of a factor of three to even, perhaps, a factor of six. But for these first three factors now, we’ve gone from 26 billion to, at best, maybe 13 billion tons, and that just won’t cut it.  06:24  So let’s look at this fourth factor — this is going to be a key one — and this is the amount of CO2 put out per each unit of energy. So the question is: Can you actually get that to zero? If you burn coal, no. If you burn natural gas, no. Almost every way we make electricity today, except for the emerging renewables and nuclear, puts out CO2. And so, what we’re going to have to do at a global scale, is create a new system. So we need energy miracles.  07:00  Now, when I use the term “miracle,” I don’t mean something that’s impossible. The microprocessor is a miracle. The personal computer is a miracle. The Internet and its services are a miracle. So the people here have participated in the creation of many miracles. Usually, we don’t have a deadline where you have to get the miracle by a certain date. Usually, you just kind of stand by, and some come along, some don’t. This is a case where we actually have to drive at full speed and get a miracle in a pretty tight timeline.  07:33  Now, I thought, “How could I really capture this? Is there some kind of natural illustration, some demonstration that would grab people’s imagination here?” I thought back to a year ago when I brought mosquitoes, and somehow people enjoyed that.  07:50  (Laughter)  07:51  It really got them involved in the idea of, you know, there are people who live with mosquitoes. With energy, all I could come up with is this. I decided that releasing fireflies would be my contribution to the environment here this year. So here we have some natural fireflies. I’m told they don’t bite; in fact, they might not even leave that jar.  08:16  (Laughter)  08:19  Now, there’s all sorts of gimmicky solutions like that one, but they don’t really add up to much. We need solutions, either one or several, that have unbelievable scale and unbelievable reliability. And although there’s many directions that people are seeking, I really only see five that can achieve the big numbers. I’ve left out tide, geothermal, fusion, biofuels. Those may make some contribution, and if they can do better than I expect, so much the better. But my key point here is that we’re going to have to work on each of these five, and we can’t give up any of them because they look daunting, because they all have significant challenges.  09:05  Let’s look first at burning fossil fuels, either burning coal or burning natural gas. What you need to do there seems like it might be simple, but it’s not. And that’s to take all the CO2, after you’ve burned it, going out the flue, pressurize it, create a liquid, put it somewhere, and hope it stays there. Now, we have some pilot things that do this at the 60 to 80 percent level. But getting up to that full percentage — that will be very tricky. And agreeing on where these CO2 quantities should be put will be hard, but the toughest one here is this long-term issue: Who’s going to be sure? Who’s going to guarantee something that is literally billions of times larger than any type of waste you think of in terms of nuclear or other things? This is a lot of volume. So that’s a tough one.  09:57  Next would be nuclear. It also has three big problems: cost, particularly in highly regulated countries, is high; the issue of safety, really feeling good about nothing could go wrong, that, even though you have these human operators, the fuel doesn’t get used for weapons. And then what do you do with the waste? Although it’s not very large, there are a lot of concerns about that. People need to feel good about it. So three very tough problems that might be solvable, and so, should be worked on.  10:30  The last three of the five, I’ve grouped together. These are what people often refer to as the renewable sources. And they actually — although it’s great they don’t require fuel — they have some disadvantages. One is that the density of energy gathered in these technologies is dramatically less than a power plant. This is energy farming, so you’re talking about many square miles, thousands of times more area than you think of as a normal energy plant. Also, these are intermittent sources. The sun doesn’t shine all day, it doesn’t shine every day, and likewise, the wind doesn’t blow all the time. And so, if you depend on these sources, you have to have some way of getting the energy during those time periods that it’s not available. So we’ve got big cost challenges here. We have transmission challenges; for example, say this energy source is outside your country, you not only need the technology, but you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from elsewhere.  11:32  And, finally, this storage problem. To dimensionalize this, I went through and looked at all the types of batteries made — for cars, for computers, for phones, for flashlights, for everything — and compared that to the amount of electrical energy the world uses. What I found is that all the batteries we make now could store less than 10 minutes of all the energy. And so, in fact, we need a big breakthrough here, something that’s going to be a factor of 100 better than the approaches we have now. It’s not impossible, but it’s not a very easy thing. Now, this shows up when you try to get the intermittent source to be above, say, 20 to 30 percent of what you’re using. If you’re counting on it for 100 percent, you need an incredible miracle battery.  12:26  Now, how are we going to go forward on this — what’s the right approach? Is it a Manhattan Project? What’s the thing that can get us there? Well, we need lots of companies working on this — hundreds. In each of these five paths, we need at least a hundred people. A lot of them, you’ll look at and say, “They’re crazy.” That’s good. And, I think, here in the TED group, we have many people who are already pursuing this. Bill Gross has several companies, including one called eSolar that has some great solar thermal technologies. Vinod Khosla is investing in dozens of companies that are doing great things and have interesting possibilities, and I’m trying to help back that. Nathan Myhrvold and I actually are backing a company that, perhaps surprisingly, is actually taking the nuclear approach. There are some innovations in nuclear: modular, liquid. Innovation really stopped in this industry quite some ago, so the idea that there’s some good ideas laying around is not all that surprising.  13:30  The idea of TerraPower is that, instead of burning a part of uranium — the one percent, which is the U235 — we decided, “Let’s burn the 99 percent, the U238.” It is kind of a crazy idea. In fact, people had talked about it for a long time, but they could never simulate properly whether it would work or not, and so it’s through the advent of modern supercomputers that now you can simulate and see that, yes, with the right materials approach, this looks like it would work.  14:03  And because you’re burning that 99 percent, you have greatly improved cost profile. You actually burn up the waste, and you can actually use as fuel all the leftover waste from today’s reactors. So instead of worrying about them, you just take that, it’s a great thing. It breeds this uranium as it goes along, so it’s kind of like a candle. You see it’s a log there, often referred to as a traveling wave reactor. In terms of fuel, this really solves the problem. I’ve got a picture here of a place in Kentucky. This is the leftover, the 99 percent, where they’ve taken out the part they burn now, so it’s called depleted uranium. That would power the US for hundreds of years. And simply by filtering seawater in an inexpensive process, you’d have enough fuel for the entire lifetime of the rest of the planet.  14:54  So, you know, it’s got lots of challenges ahead, but it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to move forward. So let’s think: How should we measure ourselves? What should our report card look like? Well, let’s go out to where we really need to get, and then look at the intermediate. For 2050, you’ve heard many people talk about this 80 percent reduction. That really is very important, that we get there. And that 20 percent will be used up by things going on in poor countries — still some agriculture; hopefully, we will have cleaned up forestry, cement. So, to get to that 80 percent, the developed countries, including countries like China, will have had to switch their electricity generation altogether. The other grade is: Are we deploying this zero-emission technology, have we deployed it in all the developed countries and are in the process of getting it elsewhere? That’s super important. That’s a key element of making that report card.  16:05  Backing up from there, what should the 2020 report card look like? Well, again, it should have the two elements. We should go through these efficiency measures to start getting reductions: The less we emit, the less that sum will be of CO2, and therefore, the less the temperature. But in some ways, the grade we get there, doing things that don’t get us all the way to the big reductions, is only equally, or maybe even slightly less, important than the other, which is the piece of innovation on these breakthroughs.  16:37  These breakthroughs, we need to move those at full speed, and we can measure that in terms of companies, pilot projects, regulatory things that have been changed. There’s a lot of great books that have been written about this. The Al Gore book, “Our Choice,” and the David MacKay book, “Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air.” They really go through it and create a framework that this can be discussed broadly, because we need broad backing for this. There’s a lot that has to come together.  17:04  So this is a wish. It’s a very concrete wish that we invent this technology. If you gave me only one wish for the next 50 years — I could pick who’s president, I could pick a vaccine, which is something I love, or I could pick that this thing that’s half the cost with no CO2 gets invented — this is the wish I would pick. This is the one with the greatest impact. If we don’t get this wish, the division between the people who think short term and long term will be terrible, between the US and China, between poor countries and rich, and most of all, the lives of those two billion will be far worse.  17:42  So what do we have to do? What am I appealing to you to step forward and drive? We need to go for more research funding. When countries get together in places like Copenhagen, they shouldn’t just discuss the CO2. They should discuss this innovation agenda. You’d be stunned at the ridiculously low levels of spending on these innovative approaches. We do need the market incentives — CO2 tax, cap and trade — something that gets that price signal out there. We need to get the message out. We need to have this dialogue be a more rational, more understandable dialogue, including the steps that the government takes. This is an important wish, but it is one I think we can achieve.  18:25  Thank you.  18:27  (Applause) (Applause ends)  18:38  Thank you.  18:40  Chris Anderson: Thank you. Thank you.  18:42  (Applause)  18:47  CA: Thank you. So to understand more about TerraPower. I mean, first of all, can you give a sense of what scale of investment this is?  18:58  Bill Gates: To actually do the software, buy the supercomputer, hire all the great scientists, which we’ve done, that’s only tens of millions. And even once we test our materials out in a Russian reactor to make sure our materials work properly, then you’ll only be up in the hundreds of millions. The tough thing is building the pilot reactor — finding the several billion, finding the regulator, the location that will actually build the first one of these. Once you get the first one built, if it works as advertised, then it’s just clear as day, because the economics, the energy density, are so different than nuclear as we know it.  19:36  CA: So to understand it right, this involves building deep into the ground, almost like a vertical column of nuclear fuel, of this spent uranium, and then the process starts at the top and kind of works down?  19:49  BG: That’s right. Today, you’re always refueling the reactor, so you have lots of people and lots of controls that can go wrong, where you’re opening it up and moving things in and out — that’s not good. So if you have very —  20:01  (Laughter)  20:03  very cheap fuel that you can put 60 years in — just think of it as a log — put it down and not have those same complexities. And it just sits there and burns for the 60 years, and then it’s done.  20:15  CA: It’s a nuclear power plant that is its own waste disposal solution.  20:19  BG: Yeah; what happens with the waste, you can let it sit there — there’s a lot less waste under this approach — then you can actually take that and put it into another one and burn that. And we start out, actually, by taking the waste that exists today that’s sitting in these cooling pools or dry-casking by reactors — that’s our fuel to begin with. So the thing that’s been a problem from those reactors is actually what gets fed into ours, and you’re reducing the volume of the waste quite dramatically as you’re going through this process.  20:51  CA: You’re talking to different people around the world about the possibilities. Where is there most interest in actually doing something with this?  20:59  BG: Well, we haven’t picked a particular place, and there’s all these interesting disclosure rules about anything that’s called “nuclear.” So we’ve got a lot of interest. People from the company have been in Russia, India, China. I’ve been back seeing the secretary of energy here, talking about how this fits into the energy agenda. So I’m optimistic. The French and Japanese have done some work. This is a variant on something that has been done. It’s an important advance, but it’s like a fast reactor, and a lot of countries have built them, so anybody who’s done a fast reactor is a candidate to be where the first one gets built.  21:39  CA: So, in your mind, timescale and likelihood of actually taking something like this live?  21:47  BG: Well, we need — for one of these high-scale, electro-generation things that’s very cheap, we have 20 years to invent and then 20 years to deploy. That’s sort of the deadline that the environmental models have shown us that we have to meet. And TerraPower — if things go well, which is wishing for a lot — could easily meet that. And there are, fortunately now, dozens of companies — we need it to be hundreds — who, likewise, if their science goes well, if the funding for their pilot plants goes well, that they can compete for this. And it’s best if multiple succeed, because then you could use a mix of these things. We certainly need one to succeed.  22:31  CA: In terms of big-scale possible game changers, is this the biggest that you’re aware of out there?  22:37  BG: An energy breakthrough is the most important thing. It would have been, even without the environmental constraint, but the environmental constraint just makes it so much greater. In the nuclear space, there are other innovators. You know, we don’t know their work as well as we know this one, but the modular people, that’s a different approach. There’s a liquid-type reactor, which seems a little hard, but maybe they say that about us. And so, there are different ones, but the beauty of this is a molecule of uranium has a million times as much energy as a molecule of, say, coal. And so, if you can deal with the negatives, which are essentially the radiation, the footprint and cost, the potential, in terms of effect on land and various things, is almost in a class of its own.  23:29  CA: If this doesn’t work, then what? Do we have to start taking emergency measures to try and keep the temperature of the earth stable?  23:39  BG: If you get into that situation, it’s like if you’ve been overeating, and you’re about to have a heart attack. Then where do you go? You may need heart surgery or something. There is a line of research on what’s called geoengineering, which are various techniques that would delay the heating to buy us 20 or 30 years to get our act together. Now, that’s just an insurance policy; you hope you don’t need to do that. Some people say you shouldn’t even work on the insurance policy because it might make you lazy, that you’ll keep eating because you know heart surgery will be there to save you. I’m not sure that’s wise, given the importance of the problem, but there’s now the geoengineering discussion about: Should that be in the back pocket in case things happen faster, or this innovation goes a lot slower than we expect?  24:29  CA: Climate skeptics: If you had a sentence or two to say to them, how might you persuade them that they’re wrong?  24:39  BG: Well, unfortunately, the skeptics come in different camps. The ones who make scientific arguments are very few. Are they saying there’s negative feedback effects that have to do with clouds that offset things? There are very, very few things that they can even say there’s a chance in a million of those things. The main problem we have here — it’s kind of like with AIDS: you make the mistake now, and you pay for it a lot later.  25:04  And so, when you have all sorts of urgent problems, the idea of taking pain now that has to do with a gain later, and a somewhat uncertain pain thing. In fact, the IPCC report — that’s not necessarily the worst case, and there are people in the rich world who look at IPCC and say, “OK, that isn’t that big of a deal.” The fact is it’s that uncertain part that should move us towards this. But my dream here is that, if you can make it economic, and meet the CO2 constraints, then the skeptics say, “OK, I don’t care that it doesn’t put out CO2, I kind of wish it did put out CO2. But I guess I’ll accept it, because it’s cheaper than what’s come before.”  25:45  (Applause)  25:50  CA: So that would be your response to the Bjørn Lomborg argument, basically if you spend all this energy trying to solve the CO2 problem, it’s going to take away all your other goals of trying to rid the world of poverty and malaria and so forth, it’s a stupid waste of the Earth’s resources to put money towards that when there are better things we can do.  26:08  BG: Well, the actual spending on the R&D piece — say the US should spend 10 billion a year more than it is right now — it’s not that dramatic. It shouldn’t take away from other things. The thing you get into big money on, and reasonable people can disagree, is when you have something that’s non-economic and you’re trying to fund that — that, to me, mostly is a waste. Unless you’re very close, and you’re just funding the learning curve and it’s going to get very cheap, I believe we should try more things that have a potential to be far less expensive. If the trade-off you get into is, “Let’s make energy super expensive,” then the rich can afford that. I mean, all of us here could pay five times as much for our energy and not change our lifestyle. The disaster is for that two billion.  26:53  And even Lomborg has changed. His shtick now is, “Why isn’t the R&D getting more discussed?” He’s still, because of his earlier stuff, still associated with the skeptic camp, but he’s realized that’s a pretty lonely camp, and so, he’s making the R&D point. And so there is a thread of something that I think is appropriate. The R&D piece — it’s crazy how little it’s funded.  27:19  CA: Well, Bill, I suspect I speak on behalf of most people here to say I really hope your wish comes true. Thank you so much.  27:25  BG: Thank you.  27:26  (Applause)","Bill Gates talked about using vaccines to control population growth, here is the unedited 2010 TED Talk video plus the transcript",false

64,184609832009703729195572089494700979116,"“Conventional generators are very thin right now because Texas has gone to so many renewables,” Robert Bradley says. | Adobe Stock  Taxpayer subsidies paid to wind and solar developers contributed to the grid nearing emergency conditions this week, according to an oil and gas expert.  “That's part of it,” Robert Bradley, CEO and founder of the Institute for Energy Research, said. “We get a lot of generation we don't need just because the tax breaks are so great, and when you keep adding the so-called unreliables, it’s at the expense of the reliables. They're the most expensive to build but the least expensive to dispatch.”  Other than mild weather and normally scheduled or expected outages, April 13, was a normal day until Texas' grid operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, sent an appeal for Texans to conserve electricity use because of allegedly near emergency conditions, according to media reports.    Robert Bradley, CEO and founder of the Institute for Energy Research | Provided  “Conventional generators are very thin right now because Texas has gone to so many renewables,” Bradley told the Houston Republic. “The way the pricing is set up, renewables are advantaged and baseload generation is not. So, we haven't had much new capacity with the baseload generators, which gets back to government policy, forced renewables and de-carbonization of the grid.”  According to ERCOT system conditions data, the wind hit its peak generation of almost 17,000 MW the next day on April 13 at 1 a.m. Wind generation subsequently dropped to about 5,000 MW during the daily periods of regular increased demand. Even the 5,000 MW, wind generation for April 13 was 3,000 MW less than what was forecasted.  “We need a lot less wind and a lot more natural gas and even coal,” Bradley said in an interview. “There have been coal retirements and some of those ought to probably come back for the summer. Texas has reached the limit of our renewable dependence. There certainly should not be any more wind or solar for the grid.”  In addition to lagging wind generation, the Texas Tribune reports that solar generation was also unavailable as it also failed to reach projected output to the grid due to cloudy weather.  “During the day, there are a lot of clouds, which is another variable,” Bradley said. “It was a worst-case scenario for renewables and this can happen at any time, which puts Texas at the mercy of wind and clouds, not only just cold and heat.”  This is not a new phenomenon. As previously reported in the Houston Republic, recent winter storms exposed the danger of energy policies that make the state too dependent on wind and solar energy and the extreme cold and snow caused the wind turbines to freeze, leading to power outages across the state during a time of overwhelming demand for energy.  “The big problem is that wind had an indirect effect and all the favoritism toward wind has ruined the economics of baseload generation,” Bradley said. “These independent generators can't just depend on emergencies where they get an astronomical price for generation because banks won't lend money on that. They need something more stable, and wind doesn't allow you to do that.”  Texas Railroad Commissioner Wayne Christian recently told the Austin News that the reliability issue isn't so much the existence of renewable energy, but that it has displaced reliable generation because they have been prioritized and subsidized by tax dollars.  However, Bradley foresees that it’s not just tax dollars, but also ERCOT’s policy of accepting electricity with bids based on marginal costs.  “The marginal cost of wind and solar is so small that they'll always win because they don't have fuel costs,” he said. “You have these generation sources where on an average cost basis, they're more expensive, but on a marginal or incremental cost basis, they're the cheapest. They always get bid in but the rates are so low that the conventional generators don't make money.”  According to a report from America's Power, through 2018, renewable energy resources — primarily wind and solar — have received subsidies amounting to more than $100 billion.  Charles McConnell, the executive director of the Center for Carbon Management in Energy and Sustainability at the University of Houston, previously told the Houston Republic that Chapter 313 subsidies are one of several tools that Texas uses to ""encourage the investments and the deployment of renewables – both wind and solar."" He points out that the way renewables often operate means that they would not be profitable without government subsidies and other handouts.  As a result, Texas' reserve margin has dramatically decreased due to the subsidizing of renewable energy projects.  “They're turning an energy-rich state into an energy-poor state is what all this government intervention is doing,” Bradley said. “At the state level, it’s just bad policy but it's also due to federal incentives, such as the production tax credit.”","Institute for Energy Research CEO: Adding 'unreliable' wind, solar is 'at the expense of the reliables'",mixture

Keep up to date with our latest:  An Emergency Order from the Biden administration’s Department of Energy shows Texas energy grid operator ERCOT was instructed to stay within green energy standards by purchasing energy from outside the state at a higher cost, throttling power output throughout the state ahead of a catastrophic polar vortex.  Major smoking gun! Infowars has been sent a Department of Energy document, confirmed to be authentic, showing Texas begging for federal authorization to increase power!  Going into effect Sunday, Feb. 14, Emergency Order 202-21-1 shows the Energy Dept. was aware of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s statewide disaster declaration and that ERCOT was readying gas utilities in preparation for a demand surge.  The order shows Acting Energy Secretary David Huizenga did not waive environmental restrictions to allow for maximum energy output, instead ordering ERCOT to utilize all resources in order to stay within acceptable emissions standards – including purchasing energy from outside the state.  “ERCOT anticipates that this Order may result in exceedance of emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, mercury, and carbon monoxide emissions, as well as wastewater release limits,” the order states. “To minimize adverse environmental impacts, this Order limits operation of dispatched units to the times and within the parameters determined by ERCOT for reliability purposes.”  Moreover, the order instructed an “incremental amount of restricted capacity” to be sold to ERCOT at “a price no lower than $1,500/MWh,” an increase of over 6,000 percent over February 2020 prices of $18.20.  On Wednesday, the Dallas Business Journal reported, “Electricity on the Texas grid has averaged about $1,137.33 per megawatt hour so far in February, up from $18.20 per megawatt hour in February 2020, according to data from the Electricity Reliability Council of Texas. That’s a jump of more than 6,000 percent.”  Days later, the Public Utility Commission of Texas set prices at $9,000/MWh.  The EO shows the Biden administration basically ordered ERCOT to throttle its energy output by forcing it to comply with environmental green energy standards, while knowing full well Texans could freeze to death in their homes with zero electricity as temperatures plunged into the single digits.

The Kremlin said Wednesday there were no formal discussions on military cooperation with Mali after France warned the West African country against hiring hundreds of Russian mercenaries linked to Moscow's foreign conflicts.  In recent years, Russian paramilitaries, security instructors, companies, and advisors have grown increasingly influential in Africa, particularly in the war-torn Central African Republic (CAR).  The Wagner group specifically has been linked to Russia's role in conflicts in Libya and Syria, where it was accused by several international NGOs this year of having carried out abuses.

Wang made the remarks at a daily press briefing in response to continuous media focus on the bio-lab in the University of North Carolina (UNC) and Ralph Baric for the former's poor safety record and the latter's techniques in artificial synthesis of coronavirus.  For quite some time, Wang said, the United States has been persistently hyping up the so-called ""Wuhan Institute of Virology lab leak theory"" in disregard of the conclusion in the WHO-China study report that ""a laboratory origin of the pandemic was considered to be extremely unlikely."" It has gone so far as to ask the intelligence community to fabricate a so-called report on origins investigation.  ""However, the United States can not whitewash itself by smearing China. The United States keeps alleging that the virus came from a lab leak, but actually, no one merits a proper investigation more than the United States,"" Wang said.  The United States was the first to start research in recombinant virus and possesses unrivalled strength in this area. It has also funded and conducted more research in coronaviruses than any other country, he said, citing research conducted and interviews given by Baric.  ""An investigation into Baric's team and lab is all it takes to clarify whether coronavirus research can create or has created novel coronavirus,"" Wang said.  He also said the United States has the world's worst bio-lab safety records, citing reports of lab incidents involving genetically engineered organisms by the University of North Carolina, and the fact key details like the nature of the genetic modifications and how the incidents were handled were deliberately deleted from incident reports.  Baric collaborates closely with the two institutes involved in research on high-risk viruses and coronaviruses at Fort Detrick, the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), and the Integrated Research Facility at Fort Detrick (IRF-Frederick), he added.  Wang said the United States has been going to great lengths to try to prove that the novel coronavirus was leaked from the Wuhan lab. However, WHO experts have paid two visits there and concluded that a lab leak from a Wuhan lab is extremely unlikely.

This wilful act of woke vandalism shows America’s self-loathing has no boundaries.  The statue was removed from public viewing after gaining notoriety as the focus of the 2017 Charlottesville Unite the Right/Antifa riots. And now a plan has been submitted by the Jefferson School African American Heritage Center to melt the Lee statue down and use the metal for new artworks, to be decided via “community engagement.” This democratic art process, alone, sounds dodgy and post-modernist, and likely to result in a series of meaningless obtuse shapes and badly rendered George Floyd busts.  Organizations backing this proposal (including George Soros’ Open Society) have pledged $590,000 towards the project so far, which has been labelled as a re-contextualization – a rather typically heartwarming and faux-intellectual act of wordsmithing, the neo-liberal way to say “vandalised, destroyed, replaced.”  Also on rt.com Robert E. Lee helped end the first American Civil War, and those seeking to erase him are leading the US into another  Gregory Downs of the University of California stated that the museum’s plan was a creative approach to “confront the past and help people better understand the past.” Naturally, this kind of banal statement is completely meaningless, with overtones of ‘something a professor worried about his job should say’. It’s smoke and mirrors, a funny dance to divert attention in avoidance of difficult truths.  The truth here is that a museum wishes to destroy a historic statue. This is not what museums are for, ever, for any reason, regardless of the type of museum or how you interpret the past. The rationale behind the proposal is another example of the twisting mind-somersaults of a nation which hates its history and loathes its present. The machination of the woke mob knows no scrupulous boundaries, every limit is prodded with language tricks and emotion. Until a new limit – or a new low – is reached.  This is a step beyond mere statue removal, such as the ‘relocation’ of the American Museum of Natural History’s statue of Teddy Roosevelt in New York City. That was bad enough. This is historians destroying history to satisfy the woke mob.  A year ago Sarah Parcak, professor of ancient architecture at the University of Alabama in Birmingham, made a series of tweets explaining how Antifa protesters could successfully pull down and destroy monuments. This occurred as rioters were vandalising the Lincoln Memorial, World War II memorials, and other iconic sites.  Ms. Parcak, an Egyptologist, went so far as to say that obelisks also “might be masquerading as a racist monument,” and require vandalism. “PSA for ANYONE who might be interested in how to pull down an obelisk safely from an Egyptologist who never ever in a million years thought this advice might come in handy,” she tweeted. She did not lose her position at the university over any of this.  in America today, one can expect professors of ancient architecture and entire museums to not just condone, but actively seek, the destruction of historic sculptures and monuments – those very things that are their ward to protect. The reverse of their primary teleological function. It is like a dentist who just pulls all your teeth out, or a mechanic who breaks every car he sees.  A little twist of thinking, and a few tricky words, and their essential purpose is completely reverted, and they become like ISIS defacing Palmyra – they have a similar fundamentalist fervor to destroy. Because nothing can impede a woke moralisation – a re-contextualisation – of historic events or truths.  All arguments presented through the examining prism of killwords such as ‘racist’ or ‘sexist’ are open to contemporary trial and judgement on pain of death. Even moralisations occurring as we speak, that are today called ‘woke’, are subject to re-contextualisation by tomorrow – and possibly deemed guilty by whatever margin the goalposts of morality have moved in 24 hours.

That is false.  In fact, the right to freedom of movement and choice of residence, and the right to seek and enjoy asylum in any country of the world, are specified in Articles 13 and 14 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR).  Distinct from treaties, the UDHR is a non-binding document. However, it is a constitutional foundation of the U.N. Charter, as well as part of the International Bill of Human Rights. All U.N. member states, “must accept the obligations of the Charter and be able and willing to carry out those obligations.”  Hungary has been a U.N. member state since 1955 and thus is obligated to follow the Charter and Bill of Human Rights. Violators can be suspended or expelled.  Apart from the U.N. obligations, Hungary is a member of the European Union, which also provides rights for asylum seekers and refugees under The Common European Asylum System (CEAS) and its base treaty, the Geneva Convention.  The CEAS states that the countries of EU must become “an area of freedom, security and justice open to those who, forced by circumstances, legitimately seek protection.” It also states that “Member States are bound by obligations under instruments of international law.”  The Geneva Convention affirms the principle of non-refoulement, meant to ensure that asylum seekers are not sent back to a place of persecution.  As controversy has surged in Europe over refugees from conflicts in Syria, Libya, Iraq and now Afghanistan, Hungary has developed a reputation as an unwelcoming, even hostile place.  To block refugee inflows, the Hungarian government has built wire fences along the country’s borders and granted only 8% of asylum applications, the lowest in Europe, where the average approval rate is 45%.  Hungary also deported thousands of refugees, ignoring the European Court of Justice’s ruling that such deportations violated the EU law.  “So far, Hungarian border guards have sent about 5,000 refugees back to Serbia since December 17, 2020, the day the verdict was announced. Hungary's leader, Viktor Orban, and several members of his government repeatedly have confirmed they intend to continue the practice,” Deutsche Welle reported on August 2.  In 2018, the Hungarian government stopped providing food to the refugees who appealed its denial to grant them asylum and were kept in camps awaiting the court ruling. The authorities prevented people from buying their own food and blocked humanitarian donations, NPR reported at the time.  Those who stayed spent months in isolation in special quarantine camps, amid complaints of hunger from a daily ration of “a piece of bread, a can of sardines and a tiny jar of marmalade,” The New York Times reported.  On August 25, the Hungarian Interior Ministry announced that it evacuated from Afghanistan 240 people (114 adults and 126 children) who cooperated with the Hungarian forces stationed in Afghanistan as part of a NATO mission, and who faced potential retribution from the Taliban.  These refugees have been transported to migrant facilities and are being held in quarantine, the ministry said.  The EU has amended its asylum laws several times in the last decade in response to refugee flows from wars and instability in Africa and the Middle East.  By the U.N.’s estimation, some 5.2 million refugees, mostly from Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan, had reached European shores by the end of 2016. Thousands died on their “desperate journey,” the U.N. said.  In 2018, some 138,000 people tried to reach Europe by sea, and more than 2,000 drowned.  By 2019, the refugee flow to the EU slowed. Now, the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan has renewed concern about a new influx.  “The fall of Afghanistan to Taliban … panicked European politicians who are terrified of another mass movement of Muslim asylum seekers,” The New York Times reported on August 18.  The Times said that in the case of Afghanistan, Europeans may feel a higher moral responsibility compared to other wars because many of its member states were part of the military coalition that invaded the country after the 9/11 terror attacks on the United States.  Since the fall of Afghanistan to the Taliban on August 15 through August 26, President Joe Biden said the U.S. had evacuated more than 100,000 people from Kabul, including American citizens and their families and Afghan allies.  The U.S. has pledged to continue efforts to evacuate Afghans even after the August 31 deadline for pulling troops from the country. On August 26, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said, “But our commitment to getting American citizens out, who may not be ready to depart, continues. There is no deadline on — there’s no end of that deadline – end of that timeline, I should say, to getting our Afghan partners out.”  The United Nations Refugee Agency estimated that between January and August 16, some 72,375 Afghans had fled from the conflict seeking asylum in foreign countries.  On August 17, the U.N. Refugee Agency issued a non-return advisory for Afghanistan. “As the situation remains fluid and uncertain, UNHCR continues to call for access to territory to allow civilians fleeing Afghanistan and to ensure respect for the principle of non-refoulement at all times – the prohibition on returning people to situations of danger,” the statement said.

(Alexei Druzhinin, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP)  Russian President Vladimir Putin attends a meeting on energy sector development at the Novo-Ogaryovo residence outside Moscow, Russia, Wednesday, Oct. 6, 2021. (Alexei Druzhinin, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP)  MOSCOW (AP) — Russia has the potential to boost natural gas supplies to Europe, where surging gas prices have ramped up pressure on consumers, the Kremlin said Thursday.  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said existing gas transit routes allow for bolstering supplies before the new Nord Stream 2 pipeline that will carry Russian gas to Germany begins operating.  “There is a potential,” Peskov said during a conference call with reporters. “It all depends on demand, contractual obligations and commercial agreements.”  Europe’s soaring gas prices dropped Thursday, a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested his country could sell more gas to European spot buyers via its domestic market in addition to through existing long-term contracts.  Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said Wednesday that getting Nord Stream 2 launched would quickly stabilize European energy markets, a statement seen by some in Europe as an attempt to prod regulators into moving fast to certify the new pipeline.  ADVERTISEMENT  Asked about Novak’s comment, Peskov replied that Russia could boost supplies along existing routes.  The 27-country European Union imports about 90% of its natural gas needs. Prices are lower in the United States, which produces its gas.  Speaking during a Wednesday government meeting on energy issues, Putin said that Russia could sell more gas to European spot buyers via his country’s domestic exchange, noting that sharp price fluctuations are bad for Moscow, too.  But he added that Russia’s state-controlled gas giant Gazprom also needs to fill its own stores to serve domestic needs in anticipation of winter.  Putin said that rapidly growing demand amid the global economic recovery from the pandemic has driven Europe’s rising gas prices. A cold winter and less power generation by alternative sources also were factors, he said.  But the Russian leader also pointed out the European Union’s efforts to switch from long-term supply contracts to spot trading in gas played a key role.  “I would like to underline that the situation in the European energy markets is a bright example of the inadmissibility of hasty and politically motivated moves in any sphere, particularly in energy issues that determine stability of industries and welfare and life quality of millions of people,” Putin said.  Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban echoed Putin’s criticism of the EU’s policies, blaming the soaring energy prices on the EU Commission’s “Green Deal” policies for fighting climate change. Hungary is an EU member.  The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, declined to comment Thursday on Putin’s assessment.  Putin, meanwhile, strongly rejected criticism from some European politicians who alleged that Russia’s failure to boost supplies was fueling price increases.  “Russia has always been a reliable gas supplier to consumers around the world, in Europe and in Asia, and always has fully met all its obligations. I want to emphasize that,” Putin said.  Putin emphasized that Russian gas supplies to Europe in the first nine months of the year rose 15% compared to the same period in 2020, adding that they could set a new record this year. He said that state-controlled gas giant Gazprom has unfailingly met consumer demands for more gas as envisaged under existing supply contracts.  The Russian leader also rebuffed Ukraine’s claim that Moscow was trying to cut supplies delivered through Ukrainian territory in anticipation of the Nord Stream 2 coming into service. Russia has pumped 8% more gas via Ukraine than envisaged by the existing transit contract, Putin said.  Analysts say Gazprom has delivered all the required gas under long-term agreements but has not sold additional gas on the spot market and instead used it for domestic needs.  That has led to criticism from some analysts and some European politicians, who accused Russia of withholding gas to pressure German and European authorities into speeding final regulatory approval for the recently completed Nord Stream 2. The pipeline is designed to deliver gas directly to Germany, bypassing Poland and Ukraine.  Other market watchers cautioned that it was impossible to say whether political or strictly commercial concerns motivated Gazprom. The pipeline is not expected to be approved in time to supply more gas this winter, but it should come online sometime next year.  Gas prices in Europe rose to a record of over 116 euros per megawatt hour ($134 per MWh) in Europe on Tuesday, more than six times the price at the start of the year. Prices came down to 104.52 euros per megawatt hour ($120.79) on Thursday, still painfully high, following Putin’s remarks.  Reasons aside from the Russian supply issue include strong demand from Asia for available supplies of liquid natural gas, which can move by ship instead of fixed pipeline, and a cold winter that left European reserves depleted.  The tight gas market combined with low reserves has led to concerns that Europe will see shortages if the coming winter is colder than usual.

Our offsite briefing today is taking place on the sidelines of the third Eurasian Women’s Forum.  Let me remind you that the Forum is held at the initiative of Federation Council Speaker Valentina Matvienko under the auspices of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly and the Federation Council of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation. It is attended by female leaders from the CIS member states and other countries of the world (over 100 states), parliamentarians, representatives of executive authorities, international organisations, the business and scientific communities, public and charitable associations, as well as the international women’s movement and the media: journalists, press secretaries, and PR people.  Yesterday we had a fruitful discussion on effective partnership in the information sphere, on the role and influence of women in the formation of digital media culture and gender balance in journalism.  Key discussion topics at the Forum include the role of women in ensuring global security, transitioning to new models of economic growth, social progress, overcoming the negative consequences of the coronavirus pandemic, achieving balance in the context of universal digitalisation, and solving global environmental and climate problems.  The Eurasian Women’s Forum can rightfully be considered an effective mechanism for interaction and dialogue between women who influence social, political and economic decision-making.  Back to top  Interregional ties of St Petersburg and the Leningrad Region  St Petersburg is an important venue for holding major international forums and conferences, provided there is strict compliance with public health restrictions. Recently it has hosted the St Petersburg International Economic Forum and other large international events. St Petersburg is a leader of the national investment climate ranking. We support the efforts of the city leadership to attract foreign investment and promote tourism.  The consistent work carried out by the St Petersburg government to support and develop cultural projects and programmes to promote the Russian language in foreign partner cities makes a significant contribution to protecting the national interests and preserving the historical memory of Russia.  During his visit on September 6, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov praised the high level of cooperation between the Foreign Ministry and the city administration, in particular, the St Petersburg Committee for External Ties, which marked its 30th anniversary this year.  The introduction of electronic visas for foreign guests of St Petersburg and the Leningrad Region on October 1, 2019 was an important factor in increasing business contacts and the flow of tourists. Unfortunately, the public health situation forced some changes, which were not so positive and complicated the follow-through on this decision. However, we will continue to simplify the procedure for the entry of tourists and businesspeople to St Petersburg and the Leningrad Region.  The humanitarian aspect of St Petersburg’s external ties during the coronavirus pandemic deserves special attention and praise. It is impossible to overestimate the contribution of the city’s medical workers and the corresponding humanitarian aid to its foreign partners: Chisinau, Palestine, Syria, Serbia, Italy, and Uzbekistan among many others.  Agreements on cooperation with 96 foreign cities and 30 regions are being implemented, as well as “diagonal” agreements with the governments of Belarus, Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan. On September 10, an agreement was signed between the governments of St Petersburg and Belgrade on trade, economic, social, humanitarian and cultural cooperation.  The Leningrad Region has secured its place among the regions doing the most to foster interregional contacts. It the first quarter of 2021, the foreign trade of the Leningrad Region amounted to $2.67 trillion. Trade grew by 8.3 percent, while exports increased 4.3 percent and imports 15.6 percent. We can also see the active development of the Leningrad Region’s humanitarian ties, especially cooperation with the regions of foreign countries in the sphere of environmental and social initiatives.  Cooperation at the municipal level is an important element of interaction between the Leningrad Region and European countries. Today there are over 100 such agreements in force. We will continue to support the development of contacts with CIS countries.  Back to top  Marking the 25th anniversary of the Solzhenitsyn House of Russia Abroad  On October 18, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov will attend a ceremony dedicated to the 25th anniversary of the Solzhenitsyn House of Russia Abroad.  On May 2019, in keeping with the instruction of Russian President Vladimir Putin and with his support, the Museum of Russia Abroad opened at the House, so now these two have been transformed into a modern museum-cum-archive, combining the functions of a library, as well as a research centre, an information and publishing centre and a cultural and educational centre.  Today, the Solzhenitsyn House of Russia Abroad is a major spiritual and intellectual centre for preserving and promoting Russian heritage abroad, which offers an effective format for a fruitful dialogue with our compatriots living all over the world and for perpetuating the memory of those who, while living abroad, did not forget their homeland and kept its traditions alive.  Back to top  Sergey Lavrov’s upcoming talks with Minister for Foreign Affairs, International Cooperation and Communities of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau Suzi Carla Barbosa  On October 18, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov will hold talks with Minister for Foreign Affairs, International Cooperation and Communities of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau Suzi Carla Barbosa, who will be on a working visit in Moscow on October 17-19. The ministers plan to discuss ways of stepping up bilateral cooperation in politics, trade, the economy, education, healthcare, culture and other areas, and sign a Memorandum of Understanding between the Russian Foreign Ministry and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, International Cooperation and Communities of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau on Political Consultations.  The two officials are expected to have an in-depth discussion on topical issues on the global and regional agendas, including crisis settlement and fighting terrorism in Africa, and review in detail the prospects for cooperation at the UN and other international platforms and multilateral formats, as well as issues of promoting further Russian-African cooperation in the context of preparations for the second Russia-Africa Summit scheduled for 2022.  Back to top  Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov’s forthcoming participation in a Valdai Club meeting  On October 19, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov will take part in the 18th annual meeting of the Valdai International Discussion Club in Sochi.  The theme of the current meeting is “Global Shake-Up in the 21st Century: The Individual, Values, and the State.” There are many contradictory trends in global development. There is much to discuss with Russian and foreign experts at this venue that has become authoritative over the course of many years. The Valdai International Discussion Club has been thriving for almost 20 years now.  Mr Lavrov will share Russia’s views on the key aspects of international developments and, by tradition, answer questions from conference participants.  Back to top  Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov’s upcoming talks with Foreign Minister of the Republic of Cyprus Nikos Christodoulides  On October 21, Moscow will host talks between Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Foreign Minister of the Republic of Cyprus Nikos Christodoulides who will be on a working visit to Russia.  The foreign ministers will discuss prospects for the further deepening of political dialogue and joint efforts to counter the spread of the coronavirus and overcome its economic consequences, and to promote cultural and humanitarian ties.  They will exchange views on current international and regional issues with an emphasis on the settlement process in Cyprus and developments in the Eastern Mediterranean, the Middle East and North Africa.  The ministers plan to sign a number of bilateral documents.  Back to top  Update on Afghanistan  We are concerned that the activity of the ISIS terrorist group has not abated in Afghanistan. On October 8, the group committed a major terrorist attack in a Shiite mosque in Kunduz in the north of the country, killing about 150 people and wounding another 200. The militants also assumed responsibility for a terrorist attack in a religious school in the province of Host, which killed seven people. We hope that the new Kabul authorities will honour their promise to deal with ISIS single-handedly without external support.  We noted the two-day visit to Qatar by a Taliban delegation headed by Afghan acting Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi. Talks were held, in part, with representatives of the US Department of State. We expect the arrival in Moscow of a representative Taliban delegation to take part in a third meeting of the Moscow-format consultations on Afghanistan.  Back to top  Outcome of the G20 extraordinary summit on Afghanistan with the participation of Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Morgulov  The G20 held an extraordinary summit on Afghanistan (via videoconference) on October 12 of this year under Italy’s Presidency. The Russian delegation was headed by Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Morgulov. Special Presidential Representative on Afghanistan and Director of the Foreign Ministry’s Second Asia Department Zamir Kabulov also attended the meeting.  Participants in the summit emphasised the need to provide humanitarian aid to the population of Afghanistan with a view to ensuring stability and security in the region as a whole. They confirmed the urgency of the efforts to counter the threats of terrorism and drug trafficking emanating from Afghan territory.  The Russian delegation laid emphasis on the importance of forming an inclusive government that reflects the interests of all ethnic and political forces of the country as a key step towards concluding a peaceful settlement in Afghanistan. It noted that the states whose 20-year presence in the country ended in a deplorable situation are expected to take a responsible approach to providing assistance during the post-war recovery of the Afghan economy. The Russian delegation urged other participants to pool efforts to prevent a crisis in Afghanistan and its aftermath, such as the growth of terrorism and drug trafficking in the region and the rest of the world, as well as a new wave of Afghan refugees and the risks of terrorists entering neighbouring countries, primarily, in Central Asia, in the guise of refugees.  Back to top  Update on Ukraine  The situation in Ukraine is of growing concern. The gap between the Kiev government’s words, declarations, statements and actions continues to widen.  In a word, the Kiev regime is promising to settle the conflict in Donbass peacefully, and is declaring its commitment to the Minsk agreements. However, it is alternating these statements with remarks to the effect that the Minsk agreements are hopelessly out of date. In fact, it is doing everything possible to drive the situation to a dead end. Over the past two weeks, the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission has recorded 2,800 attacks on the line of contact. Since July 2020, when Ukraine signed additional Measures to Enforce the Ceasefire, the number of violations has exceeded 60,000. Think about these numbers. Following in the footsteps of the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhny, the commander of the Joint Forces Operation Alexander Pavlyuk officially allowed the Ukrainian military to open fire without the higher chain of command’s approval, which violates the above additional measures and increases the number of civilian casualties in Donetsk and Lugansk. The Verkhovna Rada is considering a draft law on the “transition period” policy, which, once approved, will put an end to the special status of Donbass. It comes into direct conflict with the Minsk agreements and creates a legal basis for official Kiev to drop out of them.  Given this, it is not surprising that the Contact Group and its subgroups’ meetings for the settlement of the conflict in Donbass, which took place on October 12-13, ended without any results. The Ukrainian officials have once again done everything possible to make this happen.  Given the difficulties in settling the conflict in eastern Ukraine, the leaders of the Normandy format countries agreed during a telephone conversation on October 11 to direct their political advisers and foreign ministries to step up the efforts in this regard. For our part, we will continue our mediation efforts in the Contact Group and the Normandy format, including through our Foreign Ministry, with an eye towards encouraging Kiev, Donetsk and Lugansk to fulfill their obligations under the Minsk Package of Measures.  Unfortunately, instead of encouraging their wards to implement the Minsk Package of Measures, Kiev’s Western overseers, on the contrary, are encouraging the Ukrainian leaders in their efforts to shift responsibility for the settlement of the internal Ukrainian conflict onto Moscow.  The EU-Ukraine summit of October 12 was quite revealing when it comes to this. One could almost think that our Western partners were in some kind of parallel reality. The leaders of the EU and Ukraine called on Russia to implement the Minsk agreements in full. Apparently, they believe that not Kiev, but Moscow can grant Donbass a special status within Ukraine, declare an amnesty for the residents of Donetsk and Lugansk, and carry out a constitutional reform in Ukraine with an emphasis on decentralising its territorial structure. Is this really what the EU had in mind? If so, then it is a new milestone in international law.  Just a reminder, all of the already mentioned measures to be taken are included in the Minsk Package of Measures and are the key preconditions for a comprehensive political settlement of the conflict. They can only be realised by Ukraine, if we are talking about constitutional reform, amnesty, etc. Why are they making these kind of statements then?  The fact that Brussels is reviewing plans to deploy an EU military training mission in Ukraine is of growing concern. The implementation of this initiative, which contradicts the Minsk agreements, will further militarise that country and escalate tension in Donbass, and encourage the Kiev authorities to further sabotage the Minsk Package of Measures. We are urging them to abandon this, to put it mildly, ill-thought-out move. If this is a deliberate move, then my question is what its goals are.  Another example of a gap between words and actions of the Ukrainian leadership is the way it treats historical memory, its own history and the historical facts. During the events dedicated to the 80th anniversary of the Babi Yar tragedy, President of Ukraine Zelensky said that “dignified commemoration of the victims is our duty to previous generations.” Despite these statements, the destruction of war memorials and graves of Soviet soldiers who died in the Great Patriotic War continues in Ukraine in violation of national legislation and international law.  A monument on a mass grave of the Red Army soldiers and tombstones with the names of the soldiers was demolished in the town of Kolomyia, Ivano-Frankovsk Region, on September 30. All of this is happening at the same time under the same president of Ukraine. These statements are being made by the same people, and these actions are being performed with the connivance of the official authorities that are making statements about the need to preserve the memory of those who have fallen. On October 8, the Lvov City Council resolved to dismantle the central part of the Field of Mars memorial - a scaled-up copy of the Order of the Patriotic War.  These are the real facts. Do you believe President Zelensky is not aware of them? I’m not so sure anymore. Perhaps, he simply isn’t. This begs the question: how can he not know it and why? They don't report this to him? Did he issue an instruction not to report this to him? How can you not know about this? After all, in the end, it was not he or people in his circle who erected these memorials and built these monuments. This was done by previous generations.  President Zelensky is talking about “the horror, pain and suffering that Nazism, racism, anti-Semitism, xenophobia and intolerance bring to humanity.” What do we see in real life? This is all about them not doing as they are saying. Ukraine votes against the UN General Assembly resolutions on combating the glorification of Nazism, neo-Nazism and xenophobia, just like the United States. Sometimes these two countries use the support of some other state. In splendid solitude, year in and year out, they vote against the UN General Assembly resolution, which proposes concrete practical steps and an international legal format to prevent the glorification of Nazism, xenophobia and other similar practices. There is an explanation for this. Nazis and their accomplices are actually being glorified in Ukraine, which is exactly why they have been voting against this resolution for many years now. This is not because they do not really understand what this resolution is about, or because they are just forming their attitude towards it. That would be possible if we were talking about several years, but we are talking decades. The streets are being named after Nazi henchmen and collaborators and monuments to them are being erected. The Lvov and Ivano-Frankovsk regions proclaimed 2022 the year of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army. Can you believe it? Today, on October 14, Ukraine is celebrating an anniversary dedicated to the founding of this punitive Nazi organisation.  Once again, we would like the international community to take note of the Ukrainian authorities’ hypocritical policy and call to influence them in order to make Kiev fulfil its obligations to resolve the conflict in Donbass and preserve the historical memory that relies on facts and reality, not myths or fakes.  Back to top  Statements by Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida  We have taken note of the statement the new Prime Minister of Japan Fumio Kishida made in parliament. According to him, Tokyo will not sign a peace treaty with Russia without settling the territorial dispute first.  Perhaps our Japanese partners are trying to determine the course of peace treaty negotiations with such ultimatums, but in fact, they are making the prospects for its adoption less likely.  We invariably proceed from the premise that the first step in this direction should be Japan’s full recognition of the results of World War II, including Russia’s lawful ownership of the southern Kuril Islands. At the same time, the search for a mutually acceptable solution to the issue of the peace treaty must be pursued in line with the comprehensive development of Russian-Japanese relations through the expansion of trade, investment and economic cooperation, with confidence-building measures in the military and political sphere, and rapprochement of positions in international affairs.  Back to top  US Under Secretary of State Victoria Nuland’s visit  We believe that the October 12 talks with Victoria Nuland at the Foreign Ministry were useful and timely.  The conversation was straightforward and blunt, touching upon a wide range of issues that are viewed as irritants in our bilateral relations, including the obstacles for the operation of Russia’s diplomatic missions that were artificially created by Washington, as well as the steady stream of visa and other restrictions that we cannot leave without a response.  I would like to remind you that Victoria Nuland was on the Russian stop list, and it has to be emphasised that this stop list was introduced in response to a US stop list. What made her visit to Russia possible was the delivery by the US of a visa to a Russian diplomat who needed to travel to the United States on assignment but was repeatedly denied entry. His visa applications were denied even though he was heading to the United Nations, whose headquarters are on US soil. This is an important caveat. As a country hosting an international structure, the United States is under obligation to ensure its normal operation, including the issuance of visas to foreign diplomats, civil society leaders and experts arriving at the UN headquarters in New York to work, attend conferences and symposiums. This is the direct obligation of the United States that must not be affected by bilateral relations or other factors relating to US policy. This is set forth in the corresponding documents, which means that the United States cannot simply forgo this obligation. The United States has repeatedly failed to comply with its duties by refusing to grant a visa to a Russian diplomat. Accordingly, the Russian diplomat got the opportunity to enter the United States. He received the visa. This exchange enabled us to resolve this specific issue. However, from a broader perspective, during the talks the Russian side emphasised the need to lift all reciprocal restrictions in order to ensure the normal operation of the embassies and consulates.  Summing up the consultations with Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov, also attended by Deputy Defence Minister Colonel General Alexander Fomin, as well as conversations with other Russian officials, we can say that despite the persisting crisis potential in our bilateral relations, Moscow and Washington share the commitment to continue their dialogue in order to make their relations more stable and predictable. In this context, further escalation on the Russian track, which is what Russophobic forces in the United States are calling for – I am referring to the recent call by anti-Russia members of Congress to expel 300 or 400 Russian diplomats, and other things we are hearing from Washington – can only lead to an escalation of confrontation between our countries that has already gone beyond all reasonable boundaries.  We pointed out to Victoria Nuland that we are ready to establish contacts at all levels as agreed by the presidents of Russia and the United States during their Geneva summit. The strategic stability dialogue and cooperation on cyber security were mentioned as positive examples of these interactions.  The Russian side stressed that there is no alternative for the United States to a well-balanced approach consistent with the new geopolitical reality for building its relations with Russia based on the principles of equality and taking into consideration each other’s interests.  During talks with Victoria Nuland, we stressed that the AUKUS partnership that is being formed, or should I say knocked together, by the United States, Great Britain and Australia, not only threatens to undermine the current security architecture in the Asia-Pacific Region, but could potentially put the international non-proliferation regime at risk.  At Russia’s initiative, the participants in the talks also discussed NATO’s dangerous moves to step up its activity in the immediate vicinity to the Russian border, primarily in Eastern Europe and in the Black Sea. The recent decision by Washington and Warsaw on the permanent stationing of US military forces and deploying elements of America’s global missile defence shield on Polish territory is a matter of special concern.  On the international agenda, special attention was paid to the developments in Afghanistan in the wake of the hasty and chaotic withdrawal of US troops. Russia believes that despite the radical changes in the internal political situation in the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, the Troika Plus mechanism and the Moscow format, which brings together the key regional powers and the United States, remain relevant and can effectively contribute to promoting intra-Afghan reconciliation and forming and inclusive government that would reflect the interests of all ethnic and political forces in the country.  It was reiterated that the deployment of US and NATO military infrastructure in Central Asia is totally unacceptable for Russia. Our firm position on this matter as stated by the Russian President at the Geneva summit remains unchanged.  We agreed to maintain contacts on all the topical issues on the Russia-US agenda.  Back to top  Celebrating Fridtjof Nansen’s 160th birth anniversary  Around this time, commemorative events are being held to mark the 160th birth anniversary of Fridtjof Nansen on October 10.  The whole world cherishes the memory of prominent Norwegian polar explorer Fridtjof Nansen who was also a scientist, a public and political activist, and who received the Nobel Peace Prize. Additionally, Nansen was one of the founders of the League of Nations. He made a tremendous contribution to solving the problems of refugees, including with the help of the so-called Nansen passports. These IDs were issued to stateless persons. He also helped repatriate prisoners of war and contributed to anti-famine efforts. It is common knowledge that the UN High Commissioner for Refugees annually confers the Nansen Refugee Award.  The whole world and Russia know his personality well. Nansen sincerely loved Russia and was a staunch advocate of establishing mutually respectful relations between Russia and Norway.  Russia has organised a number of events to mark his 160th birth anniversary. The Diplomatic Academy was the venue of a roundtable discussion devoted to the diverse activities of this legendary person. We are also holding exhibitions, conferences and educational events, including some in the Russian regions. Several new books dedicated to the great Norwegian have been published in the run-up to his birth anniversary.  We really hope that, apart from paying tribute to the memory of Nansen, including in the context of Russian-Norwegian relations, the anniversary events will help us recall the fundamental principles of love for humanity, the importance of equitable and respectful cooperation and the topicality of joint efforts to maintain security and stability all over the world.  Back to top  Traditional Weddings of the World: Cultural Heritage project  We are guests at the Eurasian Women's Forum. Its participants talk so much about women and about traditional values that are for the most part preserved thanks to women. For most women, there is nothing more important than family, marriage, raising children and continuing traditions. In this regard, I would like to tell you about a Russian project, which I think is in tune with the atmosphere at the Forum and the topics raised here.  The project, Traditional Weddings of the World: Cultural Heritage, has been launched in Russia. When I received a letter from the person who initiated this project, it made me smile and I wanted to get to know him, because it was a truly fascinating, relevant and entertaining topic. It is at the junction of several related spheres: it has to do with traditions, with history and cultural studies, as well as intercultural and interreligious ties, exchanges between countries and peoples on the subjects of history and ethnography.  So who is this man? Denis Knyazev, the initiator of the project aimed at preserving the unique wedding traditions of various peoples around the world. He started with researching traditions in our country, and then became interested in the respective traditions in other countries, and how similar or different they are.  Over the six years of this unique project, expeditions have been organised to the most remote corners of our country for filming and re-enactment. Denis Knyazev photographs artefacts, costumes and museum exhibits, and he also organises re-enactment of traditional weddings of indigenous peoples. The team working on this project has published two albums about Udmurt and Nenets weddings with descriptions of their traditional wedding ceremonies in three languages ​​- Russian, English and the local language. A book about Russian wedding traditions is being prepared for publication. The Foreign Ministry provides informational support for the project. We have also asked the Permanent Mission of Russia to the United Nations in New York to cover it because in many ways, this topic overlaps with the UN agenda.  The story of a family usually begins with the formation of this family, with the wedding, with all the ceremonies. Each nation has its own special wedding customs and traditions. These fantastic books feature unique photographs and reflect the tremendous work that has been done to put them together. I highly recommend this project.  Back to top  Answers to media questions:  Question: A number of journalist investigations have resonated recently with claims that the UN encouraged attempts to stage a government coup in August 2020 in Belarus. What do you think about the UN’s response, or rather its silence, regarding the economic and sanctions pressure exerted by the West on Belarus and accusations that it encouraged a coup?  Maria Zakharova: I have not seen any investigations of this kind.  The UN’s goals and objectives deal with sustaining the international legal framework enabling countries to build mutually respectful relations, with an emphasis on the importance and value of non-interference in each other’s affairs, respecting sovereignty, territorial integrity and the rights of peoples to live the way they deem fit within their borders.  Russia’s position on the developments in Belarus is well-known. We condemned in the clearest terms that cannot be subject to any ambivalent interpretation the collective efforts made by several countries to interfere in the domestic affairs of a sovereign state and incite illegal actions and events that run counter to the fundamental laws of Belarus. We have been consistent in our position, which is not because Belarus is part of the Union State. Of course, we have a special relationship with that country and its people, but this is our fundamental approach and a matter of principle for us. This is the way we treat any country.  Back to top  Question: Could you please comment on the October 11, 2021, decision made by the EU Council to expand the list of Russian nationals designated on the EU sanctions list targeting those responsible for “undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine.”  Maria Zakharova: Let me remind you about our fundamental position that is rooted in international law: any decisions on sanctions bypassing the UN Security Council are illegitimate from the perspective of international law. This is the way to approach this matter.  From a political perspective, this can be viewed as the EU playing “sanctions games,” which is regrettable, since there is nothing but politics there. This has nothing to do with the law, and in fact contradicts it. These sanctions were approved ahead of the October 12, 2021, Ukraine-EU summit.  This sends Kiev a signal, encouraging it to sabotage the Minsk Package of Measures. Our EU partners are calling on us to fully comply with the Minsk agreements, while sending signals to the Kiev regime by making steps that are designed, in their opinion, to contain or censure Russia. They are clearly playing games. What is it if not hypocrisy? Importantly, Brussels is failing to understand one simple thing. The internal crisis in Ukraine was primarily caused by the interference by the “collective West” and Brussels into Ukraine’s internal affairs and evolved into a full-blown armed conflict, which is a shame for these countries. At first, they interfered and manipulated the interests of the Ukrainian people, and after that they just cast the Ukrainians aside. Through actions of this kind, they are now seeking to show that they care for the future of the Ukrainian people. What they are doing is a vile thing, not involvement.  Our EU partners should know better, after all it was great Antoine de Saint-Exupery who wrote that “you become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed.” Let us not once again access these actions, since we have done this many times already. Brussels must understand its responsibility for the experiments with the people of Ukraine. The sense of “taming” that Brussels has been artificially imposing for many years creates a dual responsibility vis-a-vis the people of Ukraine. They cannot relieve themselves of their responsibility for manipulating Ukraine and its people by introducing or expanding any sanctions or renewing old ones. This may sound pathetic, but we believe that Brussels must hear this and understand that they cannot play with human destinies only to betray them afterwards. Such acts and signals exacerbate internal divisions in Ukraine that are now apparent for the entire world.  The EU’s illegal restrictions even affected members of the Russian judiciary. This is an overt attempt to put pressure on the judicial branch and to undermine its independence and impartiality. How does this relate to the statement made by the Head of the EU Delegation to Russia, Markus Ederer, in his October 8, 2021, interview with RBC, when he claimed that “there is no interference by the European Union in Russia’s internal affairs?” Or is there? This is clearly the case.  Or course, Russia will not fail to respond to this unfriendly step by the EU.  Back to top  Question: The Foreign Ministry of Ukraine declared that Natalya Poklonskaya “will not be able to hide from Ukrainian justice in Africa.” What could you say about this, especially since former Deputy of Ukrainian Prosecutor-General Gyunduz Mamedov did not rule out that Ukraine could start the extradition procedure as regards the former Crimean Prosecutor? Does Kiev have any grounds for such actions?  Maria Zakharova: The President of the Russian Federation appointed Natalya Poklonskaya a Russian ambassador. She will represent Russia abroad. This has nothing to do with Ukraine.  Under the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, as a head of a diplomatic mission Ms Poklonskaya has absolute immunity against such actions, no matter who declares them, including during her travel to the country of destination and back. Everyone must realise this.  I already commented on this yesterday. I read a comment by the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry about their intention to exercise “Ukrainian justice” in Africa. I would like to advise our Ukrainian partners to finally carry out Ukrainian justice in Ukraine. First things first. Once they do this – implement their justice in their own country – then they can move to more ambitious tasks. For the time being, they are not coping with what they should do first. Let them try their best.  Back to top  Question: What is Russia’s attitude to North Korea’s right to defend itself, considering the position it recently voiced in the UN?  Maria Zakharova: The answer is simple, and it is based on international law. We assume that Article 51 of the UN Charter gives the UN member-states the inherent right to individual or collective self-defence in the event of an armed attack. This right fully applies to all UN members, including North Korea.  Back to top  Question: A foreign minister meeting in the Normandy format. Considering that Kiev subverted the agreements of the meeting in Paris in 2020, is there anything to discuss with it now? Are there grounds to hope that Kiev will accept the Steinmeier formula?  Maria Zakharova: I have already commented on this in the opening remarks. I can repeat that during a telephone conversation on October 11, the leaders of Russia, Germany and France agreed to instruct their political aides and foreign ministries to intensify efforts in this area. The work on this issue is underway.  As for whether Kiev will accept the Steinmeier formula, please first address this question to Kiev. Or maybe not to Kiev but to those who oversee its actions from abroad.  Back to top  Question: Do you already know the agenda of talks with the Afghan delegation to be held in Moscow on October 20? What are Russia’s priorities at these talks? Will the participants discuss human rights, in particular, the protection of women’s rights?  Maria Zakharova: The main emphasis will be on post-conflict recovery of the country and mobilisation of consolidated aid by the international community with a view to preventing a humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan. An important part will be a discussion of the prospects for the intra-Afghan settlement process and the need to represent the interests of all ethnic and political forces in the country in the new government structures that are being created now. Human rights are not a priority on the agenda but may also be reviewed during the discussion.  This is not to say that this topic is not urgent. If you are following the developments in Afghanistan, you know about the terrorist activities there and a disastrous humanitarian situation that concerns everyone – not only women but also men, the elderly and people with disabilities. The international community must primarily direct its efforts to meeting basic human needs.  The Western media keep trying to present us as different from them on this issue but this is not true. We cannot simply ignore the right to life if we speak about human rights priorities because they include this right. It is impossible to implement other human rights if the right to life is neglected. If terrorist attacks take place in Afghanistan, it is no longer a question of the protection of the rights of girls and women. It is primarily necessary to resolve fundamental problems linked with security and the preservation of the infrastructure that provides life support for the country and supplies its population with medications and medical aid. But this does not mean at all that human rights problems are not important or topical for us. I hope I am mistaken that your question contains such an emphasis as well.  Back to top  Question: The International Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague started hearings on Ukraine’s lawsuit as regards the incident in the Kerch Strait in November 2018. Do you consider this trial politicised? What arguments does Russia have to defend its position?  Maria Zakharova: By initiating proceedings on the Kerch incident in the International Court of Arbitration in The Hague, Kiev is again abusing international means of peaceful settlement of disputes in order to challenge Russia’s sovereignty over Crimea.  Let’s recall that in November 2018 the Ukrainian authorities staged a deliberate provocation with the use of its naval vessels. In doing so they were guided exclusively by their domestic political interests that dominate their international agenda. Despite a warning from the Russian border guards on entering the Russian territorial waters, the armed motor boats Nikopol and Berdyansk and tugboat Yanu Kapu with military personnel on board under orders continued moving forward, thereby provoking a dangerous incident. It took place against the backdrop of Kiev’s serious arms buildup in the Sea of Azov and the Black Sea and other provocations undertaken by the Kiev regime aimed at challenging Russia’s sovereignty over Crimea.  To justify this dangerous military venture, Ukraine is trying to involve in the inquiry the International Tribunal established in 1982 on the basis of the UN Law of the Sea.  Russia proceeds from the belief that Kiev’s demands in this case exceed the jurisdiction of the court since in accordance with the statement that our country made when ratifying the Convention on the Law of the Sea, it does not accept the procedures provided for in Section 2 of Part XV, which lead to binding decisions on disputes regarding military activities, including naval activities by government vessels.  In addition, Ukraine did not fulfil an obligation to exchange views directly as a means of settling disputes, which, under the Convention’s Article 283 is an indispensable requirement for launching arbitration inquiries.  Back to top  Question: Many Greek, Cypriot and Turkish media have been alleging again that Russia and Turkey were considering the possibility of ‘mutual recognition’ of Crimea as a Russian territory and the territories occupied by the Turkish army in northern Cyprus as an independent state. Is there any truth in these reports? Are there any such discussions underway? Most of the reports rely on the statements and opinion of popular analyst Alexander Dugin, presented as an advisor to the President of Russia Vladimir Putin. Is he an adviser to President Vladimir Putin or other leaders in the Russian Government, or is this his personal opinion?  Maria Zakharova: I know Mr Alexander Dugin as a philosopher, political scientist, and public figure. I would suggest you consider his statements precisely in this capacity. Perhaps he could also tell you about his roles as an essayist and journalist, but again, this is more of a question for him.  We have already come to grips with this exciting game where fake news are planted on Greek or Turkish media (I have actually found myself the subject of such publications a couple of times), and then we are asked to give explanations on this score. I would say, if anyone should give explanations, it should be the media outlets that publish such information without asking for the concerned party’s comment before releasing the reports.  If they mention Russia’s approach, official Moscow’s position, I believe (at least the professional journalistic community always says so) it would be appropriate to ask our opinion and include the relevant parts in the articles. This does not happen, although we are open to interaction and comment on everything, even online. I urge the Greek media to contact us. We will be happy to comment.  The Republic of Crimea is an integral part, one of the most dynamically developing regions of the Russian Federation. The territory of our country has never been and will not be the subject of bargaining. Stating the opposite is close to provocation.  Finding analogies between the Russian Crimea and the so-called Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus is incorrect and I would say, unsafe, even dangerous. Such insinuations confuse international audiences, undermine trust, and generate negative emotions, also with regard to the Cyprus settlement.  You are well aware of Russia's position on the Cyprus problem the country worked out as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, which remains unchanged. We consistently advocate a solution achieved within the international legal framework established by the UN Security Council resolutions and based on a bizonal, bicommunal federation, with a single sovereignty, a single citizenship and a single international personality. We support the UN Secretary General’s efforts as part of his good offices to resume the intercommunal negotiation process.  We have seen a recent increase in the activity aimed at international recognition of the illegal state in northern Cyprus. We urge everyone to refrain from steps that could lead to heightened tension between communities and unbalance the situation on the island.  Back to top  Question: As you are staying in St Petersburg, formerly Leningrad, my question is about the German Government’s sensational decision to pay pensions to the survivors of the siege of Leningrad and certain other categories of citizens. This applies to people with a Jewish background alone. Compensation paid to Jews for 70 years were linked with the work of the public organisation Jewish Claims Conference which is located in New York and which cooperates with the German authorities. Do you consider it necessary and possible to set up a certain public association with the support of the Russian state, so as to restore justice? Otherwise it turns out that only one nation had suffered.  Maria Zakharova: We set forth our position in the relevant statement, posted on the Foreign Ministry’s website, and we have also commented on this matter at a briefing.  We worked with the German party and urged it to prevent this kind of segregation.  We noted the payments made under an instruction by President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin.  We urged the German party to heed all historical facts. It is unacceptable to divide people along ethnic lines, to support some of them and to overlook the fact that everyone had suffered. One can discuss this subject for eternity. However, we have learned the lessons of the 20th century, including those with which these payments are linked. They should have taught us that there is no place for national and religious segregation on our planet. It is necessary to exert all possible efforts in the areas where there are the slightest suspicions that such a division is taking place.  We spoke with the German side for a long time. We conducted lengthy talks. They have done what has been done. We have provided our own assessment of this, and our statement and comments contain this assessment. You can read it. But it is necessary to draw the relevant conclusions from the tragic lessons of the past, so as to avoid repeating these mistakes.  Back to top  Question: This week, President of Russia Vladimir Putin had a meeting with Prime Minister of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan. The Armenian prime minister called the meeting “productive.” He said at the talks that the Karabakh conflict remained unresolved, and that it was still too early to say that the situation has been stabilised. How can the Foreign Ministry comment on the meeting’s results? How, in your opinion, will relations between countries develop, so as to attain a full-fledged settlement of the regional situation?  Maria Zakharova: The Presidential Executive Office makes principled assessments of various highest-level meetings. This is about allotting our functional duties.  Regarding the overall situation, Russia consistently advocates unfailing compliance with all the provisions of trilateral agreements between the leaders of Russia, Azerbaijan and Armenia of November 9, 2020 and January 11, 2021.  We really hope that this will help create the required conditions for normalising relations between Baku and Yerevan, including in the context of current complicated bilateral matters.  Back to top  Question: What is Russia’s assessment of the meeting between Patriarch Kirill, Sheikh ul-Islam Allahshukur Pashazadeh and Catholicos Karekin II and its importance in terms of promoting post-war settlement between Azerbaijan and Armenia?  Maria Zakharova: As you know, this is not the first meeting between the Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia Kirill, Supreme Patriarch and Catholicos of All Armenians Karekin II and Chairman of the Caucasus Muslims' Board Sheikh ul-Islam Allahshukur Pashazadeh. Religious leaders have been staying in touch with one another for decades, and have established trust-based relations, judging by their statements. We believe that this is a unique format. There is no doubt that this contributes to deepening mutual understanding between the sides and promoting inter-religious dialogue.  We proceed from the premise that the meeting, held on October 13, 2021, in Moscow will help normalise relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan and improve the overall situation in the South Caucasus, including confidence building, resolving urgent humanitarian matters, as well as preserving cultural and religious heritage. This is a very important format for overcoming problems and creating an atmosphere of trust and dialogue.  Back to top  Question: Just a few days ago in Nagorno-Karabakh, an Azerbaijani sniper shot a civilian working in his garden, virtually right in front of the eyes of Russian peacekeepers. How will Russia call on Azerbaijan to comply with the November 9, 2020, statement as part of its peacekeeping mission and to ensure the safety of the people living in Nagorno-Karabakh?  Maria Zakharova: It is true that on October 9, 2021, a civilian from Magadiz, Mardakert District, was shot to death in a firing incident coming from the Azerbaijani side. We express our deep condolences to the victim’s relatives and friends.  The command of the Russian peacekeeping force is investigating this incident and has reached out to both parties. Russian peacekeepers remain constantly in touch with the Armenian and Azerbaijani general staffs to coordinate the efforts and prevent incidents within their zone of responsibility.  This tragic event confirms the importance of rigorously complying with all the provisions of the November 9, 2020, and January 11, 2021, statements made by the leaders of Russia, Azerbaijan and Armenia. We call on both sides to remove the existing mutual irritants on humanitarian matters without further delay, exchange prisoners of war under the all-for-all formula and share all the available maps of landmines.  Back to top  Question: On September 12, 2021, a citizen of the Russian Federation, Alexander Franchetti, was detained at the Prague airport on charges of terrorism put forward by Ukraine. Does the Foreign Ministry have an update on this situation?  Maria Zakharova: We are closely monitoring this situation and all matters related to detention, arrest and similar difficulties faced by Russian citizens. The corresponding instructions have been issued to the Russian Embassy in Prague. The diplomats have established working interaction with the defence lawyers and Czech law enforcement agencies, as well as Mr Franchetti's daughter, who is in the Czech Republic now.  In connection with the September 14, 2021, Prague City Court’s ruling to place Mr Franchetti in custody, special attention is paid to his legal rights, including with regard to his current health situation.  In addition, the Foreign Ministry’s officials are in contact with his sister, who lives in Voronezh.  We are working to have this Russian citizen released as soon as possible. The defence of the detainee is also committed to this goal.  Back to top  Question: As a follow-up on the Women's Forum, one of today's sessions is titled The Mission of Women in International Diplomacy. Do you think women have a special mission in diplomacy? What is it about? Which of those “blazing fires” that you mentioned earlier today, can this “soft power” (if, of course, it is soft) help douse?  Maria Zakharova: Just go to the session to learn about the women’s role and special mission and whether it exists in the context of international relations. Why would I speculate on this topic which I believe will be the subject of a fascinating discussion?  If you are asking for my personal opinion, I have talked about it many times. Of course, we, women, have our own perception of the world which I think can make an important contribution to the discussion of multiple pressing issues, such as social protection, in particular, families, motherhood and childhood.  This does not mean at all that the contribution made by male diplomats, experts or specialists is not important. Much of what has been accomplished was developed and suggested by men. But women’s insights and experiences are truly invaluable. That includes humanitarian issues, equality of men and women, as well as new challenges and how they affect the lives of females of all ages.  We work side by side at the Foreign Ministry. There are no female or male teams. We work as one team united by common goals and objectives. This is the kind of unity that is based on a harmonious variety of opinions. I believe this makes our common work more effective.

76,169240787924948916094828378584375753859,"East Room  1:27 P.M. EDT    THE PRESIDENT: Please, please sit down. Thank you. Thank you. Good afternoon. Before I take questions, I want to make — give you a progress report to the nation on where we stand 65 days into office here on vaccinations and a few other top priorities for the American people.    First, on vaccinations: On December 8th, I indicated that I hoped to get 100 million shots in people’s arms in my first 100 days. We met that goal last week by day 58 — 42 days ahead of schedule.    Now, today, I’m setting a second goal, and that is: We will, by my 100th day in office, have administered 200 million shots in people’s arms. That’s right: 200 million shots in 100 days.    I know it’s ambitious, twice our original goal, but no other country in the world has even come close — not even close — to what we are doing. And I believe we can do it.    And today, we’ve made a historic investment in reaching the hardest-hit and the most vulnerable communities, the highest-risk communities — as a consequence of the virus — by investing an addition $10 billion in being able to reach them.    I also set a goal, before I took office, of getting a majority of schools in K through 8 fully open in the first 100 days. Now, thanks to the enormous amount of work done by our administration, educators, parents, local, state education officials and leaders — a recent Department of Education Department survey shows that nearly half of the K-through-8 schools are open now full time, five days a week, for in-person learning. Not yet a majority, but we’re really close. And I believe, in the 35 days left to go, we’ll meet that goal as well.    As of yesterday, more than 100 million payments of $1,400 have gone into people’s bank accounts. That’s real money in people’s pockets, bringing relief instantly, almost. And millions more will be getting their money very soon.    One final note: Since we passed the American Rescue Plan, we’re starting to see new signs of hope in our economy. Since it was passed, a majority — a majority of economic forecasters have significantly increased their projections on the economic growth that’s going to take place this year. They’re now projecting it will exceed 6 percent — a 6 percent growth in GDP.    And just this morning, we learned that the number of people filing for weekly unemployment insurance fell by nearly 100,000 persons. That’s the first time in a year the number has fallen below the pre-pandemic high.    So there are still too many Americans out of work, too many families hurting, and we still have a lot of work to do.    But I can say to you, the American people: Help is here, and hope is on the way.    Now I’ll be happy to take your questions.    Zeke, the Associated Press.    Q Thank you, Mr. President. You mentioned your progress on COVID-19. I’d like to ask you about some of the other issues facing your presidency. One of the defining challenges you face in the coming months is how to deliver on your promise to Americans on issues like immigration reform, gun control, voting rights, climate change. All of those right now are facing stiff, united opposition from Republicans on Capitol Hill. How far are you willing to go to achieve those promises that you made to the American people?    THE PRESIDENT: Well, I’m going to — look, when I took office, I decided that it was a fairly basic, simple proposition, and that is: I got elected to solve problems. And the most urgent problem facing the American people, I stated from the outset, was COVID-19 and the economic dislocation for millions and millions of Americans. And so that’s why I put all my focus in the beginning — there are a lot of problems — put all my focus on dealing with those particular problems.    And the other problems we’re talking about, from immigration to guns and the other things you mentioned, are long-term problems; they’ve been around a long time. And what we’re going to be able to do, God willing, is now begin, one at a time, to focus on those as well, and — whether it’s immigration or guns or a number of other problems that face the country.    But the fundamental problem is getting people some peace of mind so they can go to bed at night and not stare at the ceiling wondering whether they lost their health insurance, whether they’re going to lose a family member, whether they’re going to be in a position where they’re not going to be — they’re going to lose their home because they can’t pay their mortgage, or that millions of people are going to get thrown out of their homes because of the inability to — to pay their rent.    So we’re going to move on these one at a time, try to do as many simultaneously as we can. But that’s the reason why I focused as I have.    And here’s the deal: I think my Republican colleagues are going to have to determine whether or not we want to work together, or they decide that the way in which they want to proceed is to — is to just decide to divide the country, continue the politics of division. But I’m not going to do that; I’m just going to move forward and take these things as they come.    Q And just to — to follow up, Mr. President, can your presidency be a success if you can’t make progress on those four challenges: climate change, immigration reform, gun control, voting rights?    THE PRESIDENT: Well, I plan on making progress on all of them, but that’s going to be for the American people to decide.    I think — you know, I doubt whether — maybe you did; maybe others did. I thought — many of you thought there was no possibility of my getting the plan I got passed, passed, without any Republican votes. A pretty big deal. It got passed. Growing the economy. People’s lives are changing.    So let’s see what happens. All I know, I’ve been hired to solve problems — to solve problems, not create division.    Okay. How about Yamiche?    Q Thanks so much, Mr. President. You’ve said over and over again that immigrants shouldn’t come to this country right now; this isn’t the time to come. That message is not being received. Instead, the perception of you that got you elected — as a moral, decent man — is the reason why a lot of immigrants are coming to this country and entrusting you with unaccompanied minors.    How do you resolve that tension? And how are you choosing which families can stay and which can go, given the fact that even though, with Title 42, there are some families that are staying? And is there a timeline for when we won’t be seeing these overcrowded facilities with — run by CPB [sic], when it comes to unaccompanied minors?    THE PRESIDENT: Well, look, I guess I should be flattered people are coming because I’m the nice guy; that’s the reason why it’s happening — that I’m a decent man or however it’s phrased. That — you know, that’s why they’re coming, because they know Biden is a good guy.    The truth of the matter is: Nothing has changed. As many people came — 28 percent increase in children to the border in my administration; 31 percent in the last year of — in 2019, before the pandemic, in the Trump administration. It happens every single, solitary year: There is a significant increase in the number of people coming to the border in the winter months of January, February, March. That happens every year.    In addition to that, there is a — and nobody — and, by the way, does anybody suggest that there was a 31 percent increase under Trump because he was a nice guy and he was doing good things at the border? That’s not the reason they’re coming.    The reason they’re coming is that it’s the time they can travel with the least likelihood of dying on the way because of the heat in the desert, number one. Number two, they’re coming because of the circumstances in-country — in-country.    The way to deal with this problem — and I started to deal with it back when I was a United States senator — I mean, Vice President — putting together a bipartisan plan of over $700 million to deal with the root causes of why people are leaving.    What did Trump do? He eliminated that funding. He didn’t use it. He didn’t do it. And in addition to that, what he did — he dismantled all the elements that exist to deal with what had been a problem and — and has been — continued to be a problem for a long time. He, in fact, shut down the — the number of beds available. He did not fund HHS to get people to get the children out of those — those Border Patrol facilities where they should not be and not supposed to be more than a few days — a little while. But he dismantled all of that.    And so what we’re doing now is attempting to rebuild — rebuild the system that can accommodate the — what is happening today. And I like to think it’s because I’m a nice guy, but it’s not. It’s because of what’s happened every year.    Let me say one other thing on this. If you take a look at the number of people who are coming, the vast majority, the overwhelming majority of people coming to the border and crossing are being sent back — are being sent back. Thousands — tens of thousands of people who are — who are over 18 years of age and single — people, one at a time coming, have been sent back, sent home.    We’re sending back the vast majority of the families that are coming. We’re trying to work out now, with Mexico, their willingness to take more of those families back. But we — that’s what’s happening. They’re not getting across the border.    And those who are coming across the border, who are unaccompanied children, we’re moving rapidly to try to put in place what was dismantled, as I said. For example, of all the children who are coming across the border, over 70 percent are either 16 or 17 years old. We’re not talking about people ripping babies from mothers’ arms or little three-year-olds standing on the border. Less than — I think it’s one and a half percent fall in the category of the very young.    So what we’re doing is we’re providing for the space, again, to be able to get these kids out of the Border Patrol facilities, which no child — no one should be in any longer than 72 hours.    And today, I went to — for example, I used all the resources available to me, went to the Defense Department, and — and the Secretary of Defense has just made available Fort Bliss — 5,000 beds be made easily available. Five thousand beds on the Texas border.    So we’re building back up the capacity that should have been maintained and built upon that Trump dismantled. It’s going to take time.    And the other thing we’re doing, I might add — am I giving you too long an answer? Because if you don’t want the details —    Q (Inaudible.)    THE PRESIDENT: No, no, but I mean — I don’t know how much detail you want about immigration. Maybe I’ll stop there and fin- —    Q My follow-up question is: One, if you could talk a little bit about which families — why they’re being allowed to stay. The families that are being allowed to stay, why they’re being allowed to stay.    And in addition to that, when it comes to the filibuster, which is what Zeke was asking about, there’s — immigration is a big issue, of course, when it — related to the filibuster, but there’s also Republicans who are passing bill after bill, trying to restrict voting rights. Chuck Schumer is calling it an “existential threat” to democracy. Why not back a filibuster rule that at least gets around issues including voting rights or immigration?    Jim Clyburn, someone who — of course, who you know very well, has backed the idea of a filibuster rule when it comes to civil rights and voting rights.    THE PRESIDENT: Well, look, I’m going to deal with all of those problems. The question is, the priorities as they come and land on my plate.    Let’s go to the first question you asked — the first of the second question you asked. And that is: What about dealing with families? Why are not — some not going back? Because Mexico is refusing to take them back. They’re saying they won’t take them back — not all of them.    We’re in negotiations with the President of Mexico. I think we’re going to see that change. They should all be going back, all be going back. The only people we’re not going to let sitting there on the other side of the Rio Grande by themselves with no help are children.    And what we’re doing there, and it’s an important point to understand — I know you understand; I don’t mean to say it that way — an important point to focus on: The vast majority of people under the age of 18 coming to United States come with a telephone number on a wristband or come with a telephone number in their pocket in the United States — a mother, a father, a close relative, a grandmom or a grandpop.    What was happening before is it was taking literally weeks and weeks, and maybe even months, before anybody would pick up the phone and call to see if there really was someone there. Well, we’ve set up a system now where, within 24 hours, there’s a phone call made as that person or that child crosses the border. And then a verification system is being put in place as of today to determine quickly whether or not that is a trafficker being called or that is actually a mom, a dad, and/or a close relative. They’re establishing that right off the bat.    If it, in fact, is Mom or Dad, Dad says — to take the extreme case — “I got a birth certificate.” Then guess what? We’re getting that kid directly to that parent immediately.    And so that’s going to reduce significantly — there’s two ways to reduce child populations in circumstances that are not acceptable, like being held at a Border Patrol station. One is to get them to the place where they have a relative and set a date as to when a hearing can be held. The second way to do it is put them in a Health and Human Services facility that we’re occupying now — both licensed beds around the country that exist, as well as, for example, federal resources like Fort Bliss — to get them safely in a place where they can be taken care of while their fate is determined.    Q And can you answer the filibuster (inaudible)?    THE PRESIDENT: Filibuster. Filibuster. You know, with regard to the filibuster, I believe we should go back to a position on the filibuster that existed just when I came to the United States Senate 120 years ago. And that is that — it used to be required for the filibuster — and I had a card on this; I was going to give you the statistics, but you probably know them — that it used to be that, that from between 1917 to 1971 — the filibuster existed — there was a total of 58 motions to break a filibuster that whole time. Last year alone, there were five times that many. So it’s being abused in a gigantic way.    And, for example, it used to be you had to stand there and talk and talk and talk and talk until you collapsed. And guess what? People got tired of talking and tired of collapsing. Filibusters broke down, and we were able to break the filibuster, get a quorum, and vote.    So I strongly support moving in that direction, in addition to having an open mind about dealing with certain things that are — are just elemental to the functioning of our democracy, like the right to vote — like the basic right to vote. We’ve amended the filibuster in the past.    But here’s the deal: As you observed, I’m a fairly practical guy. I want to get things done. I want to get them done, consistent with what we promised the American people. And in order to do that in a 50-50 Senate, we’ve got to get to the place where I get 50 votes so that the Vice President of the United States can break the tie, or I get 51 votes without her.    And so, I’m going to say something outrageous: I have never been particularly poor at calculating how to get things done in the United States Senate. So the best way to get something done, if you — if you hold near and dear to you that you like to be able to — anyway —    I — we’re going to get a lot done. And if we have to — if there’s complete lockdown and chaos as a consequence of the filibuster, then we’ll have to go beyond what I’m talking about.    Okay. Hang on. Sorry. Oh, Seung Min — Ms. Kim.    Q Thank you, Mr. President, to follow up on the filibuster: So do you believe it should take 60 votes to end a filibuster on legislation or 51?    THE PRESIDENT: (Laughs.) If we could end it with 51, we would have no problem. You’re going to have to — the existing rule — it’s going to be hard to get a parliamentary ruling that allows 50 votes to end the filibuster, the existence of a filibuster.    But it’s not my expertise, in what the parliamentary rules and how to get there are. But our preoccupation with the filibuster is totally legitimate, but in the meantime, we got a lot we can do while we’re talking about what we’re going to do about the filibuster.    Let me get here. Okay, Cecilia Vega.    Q I’d like to circle back to immigration, please. You just listed the reasons that people are coming, talking about in-country problems, saying that it happens every year; you blamed the last administration. Sir, I just got back last night from a reporting trip to the border where I met nine-year-old, Yossell, who walked here from Honduras by himself, along with another little boy. He had that phone number on him —    THE PRESIDENT: Astounding.    Q — and we were able to call his family. His mother says that she sent her son to this country because she believes that you are not deporting unaccompanied minors like her son. That’s why she sent him alone from Honduras.    So, sir, you blamed the last administration, but is your messaging — in saying that these children are and will be allowed to stay in this country and work their way through this process — encouraging families like Yossell says to come?    THE PRESIDENT: Well, look, the idea that I’m going to say — which I would never do — “if an unaccompanied child ends up at the border, we’re just going to let him starve to death and stay on the other side” — no previous administration did that either, except Trump. I’m not going to do it. I’m not going to do it.    That’s why I’ve asked the Vice President of the United States, yesterday, to be the lead person on dealing with focusing on the fundamental reasons why people leave Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador in the first place. It’s because of earthquakes, floods. It’s because of lack of food. It’s because of gang violence. It’s because of a whole range of things.    That — when I was Vice President and had the same obligation to deal with unaccompanied children, I was able to get it slowed up significantly by working with the heads of state of those communities to do things like — in one of the major cities, the reason people were leaving is they couldn’t walk in the street because they were getting — their kids were getting beat up or shot or in gang violence.    Well, what I was able to do is not give money to the head of state, because so many are corrupt, but I was able to say, “Okay, you need lighting in the streets to change things? I’ll put the lighting in.” We got a contractor. We got the type of lighting. We paid directly to the contractor; it did not go through the government. And violent crime significantly was reduced in that city. Fewer people sought to leave.    When this hurricane occurred — two hurricanes — instead of us going down and helping in a major way, so that people would not have reason to want to leave in the first place because they didn’t have housing or water or sustenance, we did nothing. We’re going to do a lot in our administration. We’re going to be spending that 700-plus million dollars a year to change the life and circumstances of why people leave in the first place.    That mother did not sit around with — on the kitchen table and say, “You know, I got a great idea: The way I’m going to make sure my son get taken care of is I’m going to put a…” — how old was he, or she?    Q He’s — he’s nine. I also met a 10-year-old.    THE PRESIDENT: A nine-year-old. “I’m going to send him on a thousand-mile journey across the desert and up to the United States because I know Joe Biden is a nice guy and he’ll take care of him.”    What a desperate act to have to take. The circumstances must be horrible. So we can do something about that. That’s what the Vice President is going to be doing: what I did. When President Obama asked me to come and deal, I was in — I was in Turkey at the time, and he said, “You got to come home and take care of this.” So we put together a plan and it had an impact.    And so, the question here is whether — how we go ahead and do this; what we do. There’s no easy answer    Q A quick follow, if I may. Do you want to see these unaccompanied minors staying in this country, or should they be deported eventually?    THE PRESIDENT: Well, the judgment has to be made whether or not — and in this young man’s case, he has a mom at home; there’s an overwhelming reason why he’d be put in a plane and flown back to his mom.    Q Final follow, sir. You mentioned circumstances that must be horrific. The Customs and Border Protection facility in Donna, Texas — I was there — is at 1,556 percent capacity —    THE PRESIDENT: Yep.    Q — right now, with mostly unaccompanied minors. There are kids that are sleeping on floors. They are packed into these pods. I’ve spoken to lawyers who say that they — some of these children have not seen the sun in days. What’s your reaction — what is your reaction to these images that have come out from that particular facility? Is what’s happening inside acceptable to you? And when is this going to be fixed?    THE PRESIDENT: Is — that’s a serious question, right?    Is it acceptable to me? Come on. That’s why we’re going to be moving a thousand of those kids out quickly. That’s why I got Fort Bliss opened up. That’s why I’ve been working from the moment this started to happen to try to find additional access for children to be able to safely — not just children, but particularly children — to be able to safely be housed while we follow through on the rest of what’s happening.    That is totally unacceptable.    Ken.    Q Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to ask you about Afghanistan. You face a May 1st deadline for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from that country. As a candidate, in foreign affairs, you wrote that it is past time to end these forever wars. Can you commit to the American people that by May 2nd the U.S. will no longer have forces in Afghanistan?    THE PRESIDENT: The answer is that it’s going to be hard to meet the May 1 deadline. Just in terms of tactical reasons, it’s hard to get those troops out. So, what we’ve been doing — what I’ve been doing and what Secretary Blinken has been doing — has been — we’ve been meeting with our allies, those other nations that have NATO Allies who have troops in Afghanistan as well. And if we leave, we’re going to do so in a safe and orderly way.    We’re in consultation, I said, with our allies and partners in how to proceed. And Secretary Blinken is meeting in Brussels this week with our NATO Allies, particularly those who have forces there.    And General Austin is — just met with Kayani [Ghani] and I’m waiting for the briefing on that. He is the — the “leader,” quote, in Afghanistan and Kabul. And there’s a U.N.-led process that’s beginning shortly on how to mechanically get people — how to end this war.    But it is not my intention to stay there for a long time. But the question is: How and in what circumstances do we meet that agreement that was made by President Trump to leave under a deal that looks like it’s not being able to be worked out to begin with? How is that done? But we are not staying a long time.    Q You just said “if we leave.” Do you think it’s possible that we–    THE PRESIDENT: We will leave. The question is when we leave.    Q Do you — sorry — do you believe, though, it’s possible we could have troops there next year?    THE PRESIDENT: I — I can’t picture that being the case.    Okay. Kristen.    Q Thank you very much, Mr. President. Given the conditions that were just laid out at the migrant facilities at the U.S. border, will you commit to allowing journalists to have access to the facilities that are overcrowded moving forward?    THE PRESIDENT: I will commit when my plan, very shortly, is underway to let you have access to not just them, but to other facilities as well.    Q How soon will journalists be able to have access to the facilities? We’ve obviously been allowed to be inside one, but we haven’t seen the facilities in which children are packed together to really give the American people a chance to see that. Will you commit to transparency on this issue, Mr. President?    THE PRESIDENT: I will commit to transparency, and — as soon as I am in a position to be able to implement what we are doing right now.    And one of the reasons I haven’t gone down — I have all my — my chief folks have gone down — is I don’t want to become the issue. I don’t want to be, you know, bringing all of the Secret Service and everybody with me to get in the way. So this is being set up, and you’ll have full access to everything once we get this thing moving.    Q Okay. And just to be clear: How soon will that be, Mr. President?    THE PRESIDENT: I don’t know, to be clear.    Q Okay. And do you bear responsibility for everything that’s happening at the border now? I hear you talking a lot about the past administration. You decided to roll back some of those policies, did you move too quickly to roll back (inaudible) policies?    THE PRESIDENT: To roll back what? I’m sorry.    Q Did you move too quickly to roll back some of the executive orders of your predecessor?    THE PRESIDENT: First of all, all the policies that were underway were not helping at all — did not slow up the amount of immigration — and there’s many people coming.    And rolling back the policies of separating children from — from their mothers, I make no apology for that. Rolling back the policies of “Remain in Mexico,” sitting on the edge of the Rio Grande in a muddy circumstance with not enough to eat and — I make no apologies for that.    I make no apologies for ending programs that did not exist before Trump became President that have an incredibly negative impact on the law, international law, as well as on human dignity. And so, I make no apologies for that.    Q If I could just ask you about foreign policy, Mr. President. Overnight, we learned that North Korea tested two ballistic missiles. What, if any, actions will you take? And what is your red line on North Korea?    THE PRESIDENT: Let me say that, number one, U.N. Resolution 1718 was violated by those particular missiles that were tested — number one. We’re consulting with our allies and partners. And there will be responses — if they choose to escalate, we will respond accordingly.    But I’m also prepared for some form of diplomacy, but it has to be conditioned upon the end result of denuclearization. So that’s what we’re doing right now: consulting with our allies.    Q Just a very quick follow-up —    THE PRESIDENT: You’ve only got another hour now, okay?    Q Diplomacy: Can you define what you mean? And former President Obama warned the incoming President Trump that North Korea was the top foreign policy issue that he was watching. Is that how you assess the crisis in North Korea?    THE PRESIDENT: Yes.    Okay. Hang on a second here, Kristen. Nancy, CBS.    Q Thank you very much, Mr. President. I want to go back to voting rights. And as Yamiche mentioned, Republican legislatures across the country are working to pass bills that would restrict voting, particularly, Democrats fear, impacting minority voters and young voters — the very people who helped to get you elected in November.    Are you worried that if you don’t manage to pass voting rights legislation that your party is going to lose seats and possibly lose control of the House and the Senate in 2022?    THE PRESIDENT: What I’m worried about is how un-American this whole initiative is. It’s sick. It’s sick. Deciding in some states that you cannot bring water to people standing in line, waiting to vote; deciding that you’re going to end voting at five o’clock when working people are just getting off work; deciding that there will be no absentee ballots under the most rigid circumstances.    It’s all designed — and I’m going to spend my time doing three things: One, trying to figure out how to pass the legislation passed by the House, number one. Number two, educating the American public. The Republican voters I know find this despicable. Republican voters, the folks out in — outside this White House. I’m not talking about the elected officials; I’m talking about voters. Voters.    And so I am convinced that we’ll be able to stop this because it is the most pernicious thing. This makes Jim Crow look like Jim Eagle. I mean, this is gigantic what they’re trying to do, and it cannot be sustained.    I’m going to do everything in my power, along with my friends in the House and the Senate, to keep that from — from becoming the law.    Q Is there anything else you can do about it besides passing legislation?    THE PRESIDENT: The answer is “yes,” but I’m not going to lay out a strategy in front of the whole world and you now.    Q And then, on a related note, have you decided whether you are going to run for reelection in 2024? You haven’t set up a reelection campaign yet, as your predecessor had by this time.    THE PRESIDENT: (Laughs.) My predecessor need do [sic] — needed to. My predecessor. Oh God, I miss him.    Q Have you — have you —    THE PRESIDENT: No, the answer is “yes.” My plan is to run for reelection. That’s my expectation.    Q And then, on — on one other note, on bipartisanship: Your old friend, Mitch McConnell, says you have only spoken to each other once since you took office and that you have moved far left since taking office. Do you see it the same way he does? Have you rejected bipartisanship?    THE PRESIDENT: No, I haven’t at all. I’ve been meeting — when is the last time a President invited the opposite party down at least a half a dozen times to talk about issues? Everything from how we work — we’re working with a group of 20 members of the Senate right now and House on how we reestablish our ability to make computer chips and how we get ahead of the game, how we can work together. And we’re working together on a bunch of things.    But, look, I know Mitch well; Mitch knows me well. I would expect Mitch to say exactly what he said. But this is a matter of making sure that — I would like Republican — elected Republican support, but what I know I have now is that I have electoral support from Republican voters. Republican voters agree with what I’m doing.    And so, unless Mitch says the last thing I did is — the last piece of legislation is so far left — well, then he ought to a look at his party. Over 50 percent of them must be over that edge as well because they support what I did.    Okay. Where am I here? Let me see. Kaitlan.    Q Thank you very much, Mr. President. I have a question for you, but first I’d like to follow up on a question from Yamiche, and that’s on the filibuster.    THE PRESIDENT: That counts as a question, but go ahead.    Q Okay. I’ll make it quick. It’s a quick question.    THE PRESIDENT: No, no — you can.    Q Regarding the filibuster: At John Lewis’s funeral, President Barack Obama said he believed the filibuster was a “relic” of the Jim Crow era. Do you agree?    THE PRESIDENT: Yes.    Q And if not, why not abolish it if it’s a relic of the Jim Crow era?    THE PRESIDENT: Successful electoral politics is the art of the possible. Let’s figure out how we can get this done and move in the direction of significantly changing the abuse of even the filibuster rule first. It’s been abused from the time it came into being — by an extreme way in the last 20 years. Let’s deal with the abuse first.    Q It sounds like you’re moving closer to eliminating the filibuster. Is that correct?    THE PRESIDENT: I answered your question.    Q You also just made some news by saying that you are going to run for reelection.    THE PRESIDENT: I said, “That is my expectation.”    Q So is that a “yes” that you are running for reelection?    THE PRESIDENT: Look, I — I don’t know where you guys come from, man. I’ve never been able to travel. I’m a great respecter of fate. I’ve never been able to plan four and half, three and a half years ahead for certain.    Q And if you do —    THE PRESIDENT: It —    Q If you do run, will Vice President Harris be on your ticket?    THE PRESIDENT: I would fully expect that to be the case. She’s doing a great job. She’s a great partner. She’s a great partner.    Q And do you believe you’ll be running against former President Trump?    THE PRESIDENT: Oh, come on. I don’t even think about — I don’t — I have no idea. I have no idea if there will be a Republican Party. Do you? I know you don’t have to answer my question, but, I mean, you know, do you?    I mean, look, this is — the way I view things — I’ve become a great respecter of fate in my life. I set a goal that’s in front of me to get things done for the people I care most about, which are hardworking, decent American people who are getting — really having it stuck to them.    I want to change the paradigm. I want to change the paradigm. We start to reward work, not just wealth. I want to change the paradigm.    If you notice — don’t you find it kind of interesting that my Republican friends were worried about that the cost and the taxes that had to be had — if there is any tax to be had, as they talk about it — in dealing with the — the act that we just passed which puts money in people’s pockets — ordinary people.    Did you hear them complain when they passed close to a $2 trillion Trump tax cut — 83 percent going to the top 1 percent? Did you hear them talk about that all? I love the fact that they’ve found this whole idea of concern about the federal budget. It’s kind of amazing.    When the federal budget is saving people’s lives, they don’t think it’s such a good idea. When the federal budget is feathering the nest of the wealthiest Americans — 90 of the Fortune 500 companies making billions of dollars not paying a cent in taxes; reducing taxes to the point that people who are making — you know, if you’re a husband and wife, a schoolteacher and a cop, you’re paying at a higher rate than the average person making a billion dollars a year is — something is wrong. Their newfound concern.    I’m concerned — look, I meant what I said when I ran. And a lot of you still think I’m wrong, and I respect that. I said, “I’m running for three reasons: to restore the soul, dignity, honor, honesty, transparency to the American political system; two, to rebuild the backbone of this country — the middle class, hardworking people, and people struggling to get in the middle class. They built America, and unions built them.” The third reason I said I was running was to unite the country. And, generically speaking, all of you said, “No, you can’t do that.” Well, I’ve not been able to unite the Congress, but I’ve been uniting the country, based on the polling data. We have to come together. We have to.    So, from my perspective, you know, it’s a — to me, it’s about just, you know, getting out there, putting one foot in front of the other and just trying to make things better for people — just hardworking people. People get up every morning and just want to figure out how to put food on the table for their kids, to be able have a little bit of breathing room, being able to have — make sure that they go to bed not staring at the ceiling, like my dad, wondering whether — since he didn’t have health insurance, what happens if mom gets sick or he got sick. These are basic things. Basic things.    And I’m of the view that the vast majority of people, including registered Republicans, by and large, share that — that same — that same view, that same sense of what is — you know, what’s appropriate.    Justin. Justin Sink, Bloomberg.    Q Thanks, Mr. President. I wanted to ask about your relationship with China now that you’ve been in office for a couple months. There’s obviously the meeting in Alaska that was a little theatrical, and there’s the continued human rights abuses.    So, today, I’m wondering: Are you more likely than you were when you came into office to maintain tariffs on China? Are you considering banning imports of forced-labor products? And would you consider cutting off U.S. investment or Chinese access to international payment systems?    THE PRESIDENT: Well, look, they’re each specifically legitimate questions, but they only touch a smidgen of what the relationship with China really is about.    I’ve known Xi Jinping for a long time. Allegedly, by the time I left office as Vice President, I had spent more time with Xi Jinping than any world leader had, because President Obama and the Chinese President Hu decided we should get to know one another since it was inappropriate for the President of the United States to spend time with the vice president of another country. But it was obvious he was going to become the new leader of China.    So, I spent hours upon hours with him alone with an interpreter — my interpreter and his — going into great detail. He is very, very straightforward. Doesn’t have a democratic — with a small “D” — bone in his body. But he’s a smart, smart guy. He’s one of the guys, like Putin, who thinks that autocracy is the wave of the future and democracy can’t function in an ever — an ever-complex world.    So, when I was elected and he called to congratulate me, I think to the surprise of the China experts who were — his people were on call as well as mine, listening — we had a two-hour conversation. For two hours.    And we made several things clear to one another. I made it clear to him again what I’ve told him in person on several occasions: that we’re not looking for confrontation, although we know there will be steep, steep competition.    Two, that we’ll have strong competition but we’ll insist that China play by the international rules: fair competition, fair practices, fair trade.    Thirdly, in order to compete effectively, I indicated that we’re going to deal with China effectively, and we’re going to need three things to do that. I tell him, our people. First, we’re going to invest in American workers and American science. I said that all through the campaign and I say it again. And we’re — and I’m setting up my administration to be able to do that, which is that, you know, back in the ‘60s, we used to invest a little over 2 percent of our entire GDP in pure research and investment in science. Today, it’s 0.7 percent. I’m going to change that. We’re going to change that.    The future lies in who can, in fact, own the future as it relates to technology, quantum computing, a whole range of things, including in medical fields. And so what I’m going to do is make sure we invest closer to 2 percent.    One of the reasons why I’ve set up the — the PAB [PCAST] — the President’s board with scientists and the like, again — is we’re going to invest in medical research — cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, the things — industries of the future — artificial intelligence, quantum computing, biotech. And we’re going to make real investments. China is out investing us by a longshot, because their plan is to own that future.    The third — the second thing we’re going to do is we’re going to reestablish our alliances. And I’ve been very clear with him, it’s not anti-Chinese. And we’ve talked about it.    I want to make sure that, for example, later today, after this — as a matter of fact, shortly after this, which is fine; we’ve been going close to an hour. I’m happy to go longer. But one of the things that I’m going to be doing, I’m going to be speaking with the 27 heads of state in Europe and very shortly — I think within the next hour or so. I don’t know the exact time.    And earlier this month — and apparently it got the Chinese’s attention; that’s not why I did it — I met with our allies and how we’re going to hold China accountable in the region: Australia, India, Japan, and the United States — the so-called Quad. Because we have to have democracies working together.    Before too long, I’m going to have — I’m going to invite an alliance of democracies to come here to discuss the future. And so we’re going to make it clear that in order to deal with these things, we are going to hold China accountable to follow the rules — to follow the rules — whether it relates to the South China Sea or the North China Sea, or their agreement made on Taiwan, or a whole range of other things.    And the third thing, and the thing that I admire about dealing with Xi is he understands — he makes no pretense about not understanding what I’m saying any more than I do him — I pointed out to him: No leader can be sustained in his position or her position unless they represent the values of the country. And I said as — “And, Mr. President, as I’ve told you before, Americans value the notion of freedom. America values human rights. We don’t always live up to our expectations, but it’s a values system. We are founded on that principle. And as long as you and your country continues to so blatantly violate human rights, we’re going to continue, in an unrelenting way, to call to the attention of the world and make it clear — make it clear what’s happening.”  And he understood that. I made it clear that no American President — at least one did — but no American President ever back down from speaking out of what’s happening to the Uighurs, what’s happening in Hong Kong, what’s happening in-country.  That’s who we are. The moment a President walks away from that, as the last one did, is the moment we begin to lose our legitimacy around the world. It’s who we are.  So I see stiff competition with China. China has an overall goal, and I don’t criticize them for the goal, but they have an overall goal to become the leading country in the world, the wealthiest country in the world, and the most powerful country in the world. That’s not going to happen on my watch because the United States are going to continue to grow and expand.  Q All right. Just to follow up on the meeting of democracies: Is that where you expect, in a multilateral way, to make these decisions about sanctions? Or —  THE PRESIDENT: No, that’s not where I make the decision; that’s where I make sure we’re all on the same page. All on the same page. Look, I predict to you, your children or grandchildren are going to be doing their doctoral thesis on the issue of who succeeded: autocracy or democracy? Because that is what is at stake, not just with China.  Look around the world. We’re in the midst of a fourth industrial revolution of enormous consequence. Will there be middle class? How will people adjust to these significant changes in science and technology and the environment? How will they do that? And are democracies equipped — because all the people get to speak — to compete?  It is clear, absolutely clear — and most of the scholars I dealt with at Penn agree with me around the country — that this is a battle between the utility of democracies in the 21st century and autocracies.  If you notice, you don’t have Russia talking about communism anymore. It’s about an autocracy. Demand decisions made by a leader of a country — that’s what’s at stake here. We’ve got to prove democracy works.  Q And, Mr. President, sorry, I know you haven’t had a chance to address the tragedies in Georgia and Colorado. You had said to stay tuned for actions that you might take on gun control. Wondering if you’ve made a decision either about sending the manufacturer liability bill that you had promised on day one to Capitol Hill, or executive actions like going after ghost guns or giving money to cities and states to battle gun control.  THE PRESIDENT: All the above. It’s a matter of timing.  As you’ve all observed, successful presidents — better than me — have been successful, in large part, because they know how to time what they’re doing — order it, decide and prioritize what needs to be done.  The next major initiative is — and I’ll be announcing it Friday in Pittsburgh, in detail — is to rebuild the infrastructure — both physical and technological infrastructure in this country — so that we can compete and create significant numbers of really good-paying jobs. Really good-paying jobs.  And some of you have been around long enough to know that used to be a great Republican goal and initiative. I still think the majority of the American people don’t like the fact that we are now ranked, what, 85th in the world in infrastructure.  I mean, look, the future rests on whether or not we have the best airports that are going to accommodate air travel, ports that you can get in and out of quickly, so businesses decide.  Some of you, if you were ever local reporters, and you found your governor or mayor trying to attract business to your community, what’s the first thing that businesses asked? “What’s the closest access to — access to an interstate highway? How far am I from a freight rail? Is the water — is the water available? Is there enough water available for me to conduct my business?” All the things that relate to infrastructure.  We have somewhere — I asked the staff to write it down for me, and they did — not for this, but for a longer discussion. We have somewhere, in terms of infrastructure — we have — we rank 13th globally in infrastructure. China is investing three times more in infrastructure than the United States is.  Bridges: More than one third of our bridges — 231,000 of them — need repairs. Some are physical safety risks or preservation work. One in five miles of our highways and major roads are in poor condition. That’s 186,000 miles of highway. Aviation: 20 percent of all flights — 20 percent of all flights weren’t on time, resulting in 1.5 million hours lost in production. Six to ten million homes in America still have lead pipes servicing their water lines. We have over 100,000 wellheads that are not capped, leaking methane.  What are we doing? And, by the way, we can put as many pipefitters and miners and — to work capping those wells at the same price that they would charge to dig those wells.  So, I — I just find it frustrated — frustrating to talk about.    Last point I’ll make on the infrastructure — and I apologize for spending more time on it, but — is that if you think about it, it’s the place where we will be able to significantly increase American productivity, at the same time providing really good jobs for people. But we can’t build back to what they used to be. We have to build — the environment has — global warming has already done significant damage.    The roads that used to be above the water level — didn’t have to worry about where the drainage ditch was — now you got to rebuild them three feet higher. Because it’s not going to go back to what it was before; it will only get worse, unless we stop it.    There’s so much we can do. Look at all of the schools in America. Most of you live in the Washington area now. But in your hometowns — I don’t know where you’re all from — how many schools where the kids can’t drink the water out of the fountain? How many schools are still in the position where there’s asbestos? How many schools in America we’re sending our kids to don’t have adequate ventilation? How many homes, buildings, office complexes are wasting billions of barrels of oil over time because they can’t hold in the heat or the air conditioning because it leaks through the windows that are so porous and the connections? It’s amazing.    So there’s so much we can do that’s good stuff, makes people healthier, and creates good jobs.    And I think that I got one more question here. Janet from Univision.    Q Thank you, Mr. President. We, too, have been reporting at the border. And just like Cecilia, we ran into a pair of siblings who came in on Monday, who were detained by CBP — had the phone number for their mother who lives in the U.S. We have contacted the mother. That’s the only way they know her kids are here because CBP, today, Thursday, has not contacted that mother. So when can we expect your promise of things getting better with contacting and expediency and processing?    THE PRESIDENT: Well, they’re already getting better, but they’re going to get real — they’ll get a whole hell of lot better real quick, or we’re going to hear of some people leaving, okay?    We can get this done. We’re going to get it done.    I had a long meeting with the entire team and several Cabinet-level officers the other night. We’re going to be moving, within the next — within the next week, over 100,000 — I mean, 1,000 people out of the Border Patrol into safe, secure beds and facilities. We’re going to significantly ramp up. We’re already out there contacting everyone, from getting some of the employees at HHS — and there’s a lot of them doing other things — and move them into making those calls. We’re in a — we’re in the process of rearranging and providing for the personnel needed to get that done.    But I admire the fact that you were down there; you’re making the calls yourself. It’s real.    The next thing that has to happen though — as you well know has to happen — there have to be some certitude that this is the — actually mom, dad, or whomever. And there’s ways to do that. There’s ways to do that — a little bit like determining whether or not you got the right code for your credit card, you know? “What was your dog’s name?” kind of a thing. I’m being a bit facetious, but not really. And also seeking harder data, from DNA to — to birth certificates, which takes longer.    So, I want to do this as quickly as humanly possible and as safely as possible.    Q As you well know, treating the root cau- — causes in Latin America doesn’t change things overnight. How do you realistically and physically keep these families from coming to the U.S. when things will not get better in their countries right away?    THE PRESIDENT: Well, I can’t guarantee that. But I know, you know, that old thing: The journey of 1,000 miles starts with the first step.    You know as well as I do; you cover it: You have serious — it’s not like somebody at a sitting hand-hewn table in Guatemala — I mean, in — in somewhere in Mexico or in Guadalupe, saying, “I got a great idea. Let’s sell everything we have. Give it to a coyote. Have him take our kids across the border and into a desert where they don’t speak the language. Won’t that be fun? Let’s go.” That’s not how it happens. People don’t want to leave.    When my great grandfather got on a coffin ship in the Irish Sea, expectation was: Was he going to live long enough on that ship to get to the United States of America? But they left because of what the Brits had been doing. They were in real, real trouble. They didn’t want to leave. But they had no choice. So you got — we can’t — I can’t guarantee we’re going to solve everything, but I can guarantee we can make everything better. We can make it better. We can change the lives of so many people.    And the other thing I want to point out to you and I hope you point out: I realize it’s much more heart wrenching — and it is — to deal with a five- and six- and seven-year-old. But you went down there, and you saw: The vast majority of these children — 70 percent — are 16 years old, 17 years old, and mostly males. Doesn’t make it — that doesn’t make it good, bad, or indifferent. But the idea that we have tens of thousands of kids in these God-awful facilities that are, really, little babies crying all night — and there’s some; that’s true. That’s why we got to act.    And yesterday, I asked my team — both the director of the two agencies, as well as others — I asked them what would they, in fact — and I asked their opinion because they’re the experts — but I said, “Focus on the most vulnerable immediately.”    But there’s no reason why, in the next month, as people cross the border, that phone call can’t be made in the first 48 hours and begin.    Q If I may ask one last question: Have you had any talks with Senate Republicans who are threatening this administration with not considering the immigration legislation that was passed in the House until the situation at the border has been resolved?

77,330410406993050000414374130034289094106,"By Jani Allan , a writer and talk show host. She has written for the London Sunday Times, the Spectator, the Daily Mail and various other British publications. Her memoir Jani Confidential was published by Jacana Media.  The mainstream media and the medical orthodoxy is adamant that everyone needs to get the jab – or face exclusion from everyday freedoms and be shunned from society. Don’t they realise how fascistic this view is?  This is not an anti-vaccine rant. It is a sober discussion of the matter of civil liberties.  Since March 2020, we have been forced to wear masks.  The mask is a crucifix. It signals to society that you are a believer. (In Covid-19.) It tells society that you are compliant and have submitted.  Like taking the knee, it is virtue signalling. It says you are happy with the lockdowns because, hey, you don’t have to go to work and you still get a ‘stimmy’ cheque. The single most effective way of breaking down a human being is social isolation and distancing. Irreparable harm is being done to children, especially, by enforced mask wearing.  Also on rt.com WHO gives emergency approval to China's Sinopharm Covid-19 vaccine, sixth jab to be backed by UN agency  In any free society, we should be able to ask questions and make our own choices about receiving medical treatment, or not. But anyone who asks questions is automatically branded “anti-science”. The notion that there is just one scientific doctrine to follow is actually anti-scientific in itself. And that’s not just my view, but that of scientists.  The notion that freedom of speech still exists in America today is a nonsense. Those that dare question the efficacy of the smorgasbord of vaccinations are cancelled and shamed. They are dehumanized and ‘othered.’  The First Amendment to the United States Constitution prevents the government from making laws which regulate an establishment of religion, prohibit the free exercise of religion, or abridge the freedom of speech, the freedom of the press, the right to peaceably assemble, or the right to petition the government for redress of grievances. It was adopted on December 15, 1791, as one of the ten amendments that constitute the Bill of Rights.  The premise of the First Amendment is unique. Allowing freedom of speech means allowing someone who disagrees with you the right to voice their opinion, however offensive it might be.  It is precisely this freedom of speech that made America great. Be prepared to be offended. How tragic that the press are now the government lapdogs. “The View”, a daily talk show on ABC, is just one of many outlets that seek to humiliate and shame those who are not following the approved Covid narrative. For the last couple of weeks, I have watched its presenter, Sunny Hostin, insult Americans whom she brands the ‘vaccine hesitant.’  Here’s her take on life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness in 2021 America: “When you look at the folks that are not getting vaccinated because it’s a quarter of Americans that are not getting vaccinated, white evangelicals, 45% said they won’t get vaccinated… Republicans, almost 50% are refusing to get the vaccine. We won’t reach herd immunity because of those particular groups.  “I say we need to shun those that refuse to get vaccinated. Just like now in certain states... there are signs on storefronts on businesses.. [stating] no mask, no entry. I think if you have not been vaccinated, no entry. You want to get on a plane? You have to be vaccinated. … You don’t get the liberties that come with immunity. Something has to break. If that’s your personal choice not to get vaccinated, you don’t then get to infringe on the rights of those who have chosen to protect their fellow citizens.”  Also on rt.com WHO asks Big Pharma for more transparent vaccine data with fewer redactions to boost ‘public trust’ & scientific ‘integrity’  And, of course, all these glossy women in the mainstream media, with their big, strong teeth, concur that Donald Trump must be banned from every platform and be punished for his alleged mishandling of the virus.  “So many people hang on his every word. He is still a public safety threat,” Hostin explains. “He can harm public safety and harm this country. He is too much of a danger. He doesn’t need to contaminate the airwaves.”  This subjectivity of censorship is why the cure is worse than the illness.  We live in a post-truth world whose emblem is stupefying hypocrisy. The leftists view on abortion is: “My body, my choice.” However, the leftists’ view on vaccines is: “Your body, my choice.”  The consensus of these people – and they are to be found on every other mainstream channel and newspaper, not just ABC – is that they don’t want unvaccinated people around them. Unvaccinated people are the unclean and should be punished. They shouldn’t be allowed to take their children to schools, go to restaurants, take cruises or even walk in the park. Don’t you dare come near me without a vaccine.  Does that mean I am to be banned from planes, shops and offices, as Hostin advocates?  Can the state compel you to take a vaccine with the reward of everyday freedoms? Technically, no. Roe v. Wade decided that no one can be discriminated against based on an aspect of their medical history, so unless the US Supreme Court overrules that case, vaccine and vaccine passports are in fact unconstitutional and illegal.  The Texas pediatrician Peter Hotez, backed by Bill Gates, wrote in Nature magazine recently. Hotez claims there is “anti-vax aggression” and he equates anti-vaxxers with cybercriminals and nuclear terrorists. He wants the United Nations to establish shock troops to hunt down and eliminate them.  Last time I looked, the groups that are actually committing violence are BLM and Antifa. But they are never called to account. The mainstream media now effectively designates anti-vaxxers as terrorists. Vaccine sceptics are the dangers and risks to society, while BLM and Antifa are the good guys.  The latest attack on the bone-headed populace – aka, those that haven’t been vaccinated – by Hostin and her fellow travellers is chilling.  Even her co-presenter Whoopi Goldberg was a little taken back: “Requiring proof that one has been vaccinated in order to travel – is this crazy?”  Hostin was unmoved: “It’s not a radical idea, the vaccine is solid.”  “At what time do we give up on these boneheads?” another host, Joy Behar, demanded. “You have to have proof of vaccination. Everyone must be inconvenienced. You don’t get to certain events. This is not a political issue.”  Behar, Hostin et al. obviously concur with the Michigan Governor, Gretchen Witmer, who has made her entire state hostage to being vaccinated. Get the jab or suffer gunpoint-enforced lockdowns: they won’t end until 70% of the state’s adults surrender to being injected.  This is fascistic coercion that violates restrictions against medical experiments, violates fundamental human rights and the requirement for informed consent. Surely such tactics should never be deployed or tolerated in a free society?  Are we who choose to stay vaccine-free, who declare we have sovereign rights over our own bodies, to be publicly singled out, excluded and punished? After the Nuremberg Race Laws were passed in Germany in 1935, Jews were ostracised, discriminated against, and later had to wear a yellow badge so as to make ‘the enemy within visible.'  Also on rt.com Billionaires like Bill Gates won’t save us from Covid, or fix fake news or the climate crisis. Because it’s not in their interests  Are those of us in the 21st century unable to provide proof of being vaccinated against Covid, going to suffer a similar fate? (And, just to be clear, I am not making any comparisons to the later, heinous genocide that occured, but simply to how a majority can go down the road of singling out and discriminating against a minority).  Today’s mainstream media seems intent on creating a two-tier society: the virtuous vaccinated and the unclean unvaccinated. Covid apartheid, anyone?  Like this story? Share it with a friend!","I am one of millions who have chosen not to have a Covid vaccine. Does that mean I’m to be banned from planes, buildings & shops?",false

Сообщения о русском следе в происхождении так называемого ""гаванского синдрома"" у сотрудников диппредставительств США являются ""фейками русофобского агитпропа"" и выдумками за гранью здравого смысла, заявил заместитель директора Департамента информации и печати МИД РФ Александр Бикантов.Он напомнил, что недавно о симптомах ""гаванского синдрома"" сообщили сотрудники посольства США в Австрии, которые якобы жалуются на постоянные головные боли, головокружения и неспособность концентрироваться. Началось все в 2016 году с жалоб американских дипломатов в Гаване, к которым затем добавились их коллеги из посольства Канады на Кубе.""Правда, канадцы вскоре отыграли назад, когда по итогам совместного с кубинцами расследования выяснилось, что виноваты карибские цикады и применявшиеся для борьбы с комарами фумигаторы"", - напомнил Бикантов.При этом в Вашингтоне ""с упорством, достойным лучшего применения, продолжают передавать СМИ дутые сенсации о ""русском следе"" в злонамеренных действиях на голову своих дипломатов с помощью звуковых, радио- и энергетических волн"".Он посетовал также, что ""любовь западной бульварной прессы к конспирологии неискоренима"".""Советовали бы качественным медиа избегать этого зыбкого поля. Иначе в следующий раз русских придется обвинять в солнечных затмениях или снегопадах. Пределам таким нездоровым фантазиям нет. И мы видим, они будут еще, если за них берутся вашингтонские пропагандисты"", - добавил он.Так называемый ""гаванский синдром"" наблюдался среди дипломатов США на Кубе в 2016 и 2017 годах, а также в КНР в 2018 году. Дипломаты, предположительно, подверглись звуковому воздействию, которое привело к долговременным последствиям для здоровья. Периодически в прессе в США звучали обвинения в адрес России в организации ""акустических атак"", МИД РФ назвал эти обвинения ""полным абсурдом и странными инсинуациями"". Ранее в четверг директор ЦРУ Уильям Бернс заявил, что за необъяснимыми эпизодами ухудшения состояния американских дипломатов может стоять Россия, но сделать сколько-нибудь определенные выводы не позволяет нехватка данных.Случаи недомогания, похожие на ""гаванский синдром"", также, по данным СМИ, были зафиксированы у американских представителей в Африке, Таджикистане и Москве. Последний известный случай необъяснимых недомоганий среди американских дипломатов произошел в Вене. В общей сложности, по данным главы ЦРУ, во всех инцидентах пострадали несколько сотен американских дипломатов, разведчиков и военных, как сообщает CNN, около сотни из них были сотрудниками ЦРУ.  https://ria.ru/20210802/eskalatsiya-1743954495.html  https://ria.ru/20210726/zakharova-1743003934.html  https://ria.ru/20210712/krazha-1740918941.html  вена  африка  россия  РИА Новости 1 5 4.7 96 internet-group@rian.ru 7 495 645-6601 ФГУП МИА «Россия сегодня» https://xn--c1acbl2abdlkab1og.xn--p1ai/awards/ 353 60 353 60  2021  РИА Новости 1 5 4.7 96 internet-group@rian.ru 7 495 645-6601 ФГУП МИА «Россия сегодня» https://xn--c1acbl2abdlkab1og.xn--p1ai/awards/ 353 60 353 60  Новости  ru-RU  https://ria.ru/docs/about/copyright.html  https://xn--c1acbl2abdlkab1og.xn--p1ai/  РИА Новости 1 5 4.7 96 internet-group@rian.ru 7 495 645-6601 ФГУП МИА «Россия сегодня» https://xn--c1acbl2abdlkab1og.xn--p1ai/awards/ 353 60 353 60  1920 1080 true  1920 1440 true  1920 1920 true  РИА Новости 1 5 4.7 96 internet-group@rian.ru 7 495 645-6601 ФГУП МИА «Россия сегодня» https://xn--c1acbl2abdlkab1og.xn--p1ai/awards/ 353 60 353 60  РИА Новости 1 5 4.7 96 internet-group@rian.ru 7 495 645-6601 ФГУП МИА «Россия сегодня» https://xn--c1acbl2abdlkab1og.xn--p1ai/awards/ 353 60 353 60  вена, африка, министерство иностранных дел российской федерации (мид рф), уильям бернс, россия","Замдиректора по информации МИД Бикантов назвал сообщения о ""русских пси-лучах"" русофобскими",false
79,220711724164883564605517914527897594743,"On May 4, Libya’s new interim government demanded that Turkey remove its forces from the country, which for the past decade has been riven with war involving foreign countries.  “We call on Turkey to cooperate with us to put an end to the presence of all foreign forces and mercenaries, in order to preserve the sovereignty,” Libyan Foreign Minister Najla al-Mangoush told a visiting Turkish delegation in Tripoli on May 4.  But Turkey’s Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu responded that his country’s military came at the request of the Libyan government and should remain to train the Libyan troops. In January 2020, Turkey announced it has begun sending regular troops to aid the government in Tripoli, but Ankara has denied ties to foreign mercenaries in Libya.  On May 6 in Germany, Cavusoglu said:  “We agree that all foreign mercenaries in Libya need to leave the country. But there are also bilateral agreements (with the Libyan government for Turkish troops to be stationed there). And that is a different issue. And we cannot and must not prevent such a cooperation. And one must not call those instructors mercenaries.”  That is misleading. The statement ignores multiple credible reports that Turkey has recruited Syrian mercenaries and sent them to fight in Libya by the thousands – even child fighters.  The U.S. Defense Department's Inspector General concluded that in the first three months of 2020, Turkey sent some 3,500-3,800 Syrian mercenaries to Libya.  According to other estimates, Turkey has sent anywhere from 13,000 to more than 16,000 Syrian mercenaries. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported in July 2020 that “the number of recruits who arrived in Libya rose to 16,100 Syrian mercenaries, including 340 children under the age of 18.”  Turkey’s government recruited Syrian mercenaries promising $2,000 a month and Turkish citizenship, various Western media outlets reported in January 2020.  Skirmishing over the presence of foreign forces has continued since last fall.  Libya’s U.N.-supported Government of National Accord (GNA), based in the capital Tripoli, had been at war since 2011 with the self-styled Libyan National Army, under the command of Gen. Khalifa Haftar. Russia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and France support Haftar, who controls Eastern Libya, while Turkey backs the Tripoli-based government.  A United Nations resolution adopted in October demanded the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Libya “without further delay.”  All the nations involved in Libya largely ignored the U.N.’s January deadline to withdraw forces.The United States condemned violations of the deadline and called on all foreign powers to “immediately cease all military intervention.”  In April, the United Nations, Arab League, European Union and African Union also demanded “the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of all foreign forces and mercenaries from the entirety of Libya’s territory.”  The Government of National Accord, however, was removed in late March as it failed to implement a U.N. Security Council peace plan. With the agreement of the warring sides, the GNA was replaced by an interim government to ensure a smooth transition of power ahead of the general elections to be held in December.  The interim government also has consistently urged removal of all foreign forces from Libya.  In his remarks, Cavusoglu disputed the idea that “the Turkish presence in Libya is equivalent to that of illegitimate groups.”  The U.N. estimated in December that more than 20,000 foreign mercenaries are in Libya, including Syrians, Russians, Sudanese and Chadians.  German public broadcaster Deutsche Welle reported that Syrian mercenaries recruited by Turkey could become a new security threat in the Middle East.  On April 29, The Associated Press cited unnamed diplomats as linking the killing of Chad’s President Idriss Deby with Chadian rebels “believed to have been armed and trained in Libya.”  Deby died on April 19 of wounds sustained during a fight with an unknown rebel group. U.N. Security Council members “linked the mercenaries and foreign fighters in Libya with what happened in Chad, and stressed the importance of getting the foreigners out,” the AP reported.",Turkey’s Misleading Claim About Mercenaries in Libya,mixture
80,317355157742103975136926845356516613847,"The following is an extended transcript of an interview with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan that aired on Sunday, September 26, 2021, on ""Face the Nation.""  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. President, thank you for making time.  PRESIDENT RECEP TAYYIP ERDOĞAN: Thank you.  MARGARET BRENNAN: President Biden has described the world as split between autocrats and Democrats. And he's called you an autocrat. How do you describe your relationship with President Biden?  PRESIDENT RECEP TAYYIP ERDOĞAN: Well, as of now, Mr. President's definition of an autocrat remains unknown to me, I don't know what he meant, but my past is of a political past, and in my political past, which dates back to four decades -- and I've always internalized democracy and I have dedicated these four decades to servicing my people. That's the kind of a leader I am and this is how I came to be what I am today. And because of the fact that my people never complained of me, I've always accomplished and triumphed at the end of every election that I partook in the last 20 years. In 1994, I became the mayor of Metropolitan City of Istanbul. And then I became the prime minister, and then I became the president, and I still am the president of my country servicing my people. This is the process, and I really don't know what Mr. President meant by saying autocrat.  MARGARET BRENNAN: He said you're going to have to pay a price for some of your actions. He said this when he was a candidate and he talked about human rights abuses. Has he ever talked directly to you about what he meant?  PRESIDENT ERDOĞAN: Well, on the contrary, he never mentioned any of these issues to me. And, I know whenever we got together, he's very respectful towards me. And ever since the days when he was the vice president, he was always very respectful-- that's how he approached me, and it is very difficult for me to understand why he's using such a definition when he's talking about me. And the last time we got together was in Brussels in June. We just discussed the situation vis-a-vis the Karzai airport in Afghanistan when they were preparing to withdraw from the airport. He proposed us to possibly run the airport, and this is a great demonstration of his confidence in us. So I would like to ask you, he trusts us enough to propose us to run the Karzai airport. This is his thoughts and impressions on us, and it is still very difficult for me to understand why he would deviate from that now. And he would call me an autocrat. I wished to have seen- Mr. President would talk to me about these issues directly and tête-à-tête.  MARGARET BRENNAN: But you're not meeting him during this visit.  PRESIDENT ERDOĞAN: Well, right now, under these circumstances-- Well due to the pandemic level is only good as far as I'm concerned, he's not having bilateral meetings with the leaders and we have invited him for a prospective bilateral, but he didn't respond positively.  MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about Afghanistan. The CIA already says that it is seeing members of al Qaeda potentially move back into Afghanistan. Do you think the US departure from Afghanistan makes the region less safe?  PRESIDENT ERDOĞAN: Of course. With the American footprints dating back to two decades, the region was not any safer. On the contrary, every day the region lost more blood and we used to have 1000 troops in Afghanistan and we executed our duties in order to protect the airport in Afghanistan. And finally, when we were asked to possibly run the airport, we got together in Brussels with President Biden where we discussed these issues, and we told him that we could possibly assume such a responsibility. But on the condition of three requests: one of them is logistical support. And of course, what would logistical support stand for? It's including financial and equipment support, the ammunitions, the vehicles and the weapons there would have been transferred to us. But such things have unfolded that the exact opposite happened. The artillery, the ammunition, the weapons and the vehicles at the Karzai airport were all transferred over to Taliban, and Taliban is currently using all those weapons and all those vehicles, and we have to see all these facts for what they are. But we are actually accustomed to certain things because similarly, the terrorist organizations in and around Turkey are receiving logistical support from the United States at a very severe extent--  MARGARET BRENNAN: --What are you talking about?  PRESIDENT ERDOĞAN: --and it was the case with the previous government, with the previous administration? And it's exactly the same right now. (00:09:07) The terrorist organizations. Receiving this kind of support should be stopped once and for all: PKK, YPD, PYG, these are the terrorist organizations which have received significant artillery and weapons support.  MARGARET BRENNAN: They were US allies in the fight against ISIS, have you seen any evidence that weapons provided to them went back into Turkey? Is there any threat to you from any of these groups because of U.S. support?  PRESIDENT ERDOĞAN: I've raised this issue personally with President Trump when he was in the office and currently, trucks full of artillery, ammunition and weapons are coming to the region, and we have provided this information to the administration through our intelligence agency.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Did you present it to President Biden?  PRESIDENT ERDOĞAN: All of this was submitted to our interlocutors, and the current Turkish intelligence chief is talking to his counterpart on a continuous basis, and we will never shy away from sharing this information with our interlocutors because there are certain facts  MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.  PRESIDENT ERDOĞAN: that we have to admit to the United States is a NATO member. Similarly, Turkey is NATO member and we are in a position to be obliged to forge a solidarity under the roof of NATO. But so long as the terrorist organizations receive such logistical support that upset us and we would be vocal about this  MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to come back to Afghanistan. But let me finish here because you took us to Syria. There are still nine hundred troops in Syria, and you had that moment with President Trump, where he moved U.S. troops out of the way and Turkey went into northern Syria. This was hugely controversial in the United States because it looked to many people like President Trump sold out America's Kurdish allies. Did he promise you that he would pull all U.S. troops out of Syria? And have you asked President Biden to do that?  PRESIDENT ERDOĞAN: The situation in Syria is of a different nature. Region by region, certain places had been entirely evacuated or abandoned. There is the western side and the eastern side of the Euphrates River. We have Russia there. We have the regime forces, Iran and us. The outstanding issue is to find a sustainable way to continue with this solidarity. We are always defending the idea to continue with this solidarity in a positive way—  MARGARET BRENNAN: But did you tell President Trump that Turkish troops would fire on American troops?  PRESIDENT ERDOĞAN: --and we are currently leading this process.  PRESIDENT ERDOĞAN: Would you possibly repeat your question?  Did you tell President Trump that if U.S. troops didn't get out of the way, that Turkish troops would fire on them? And have you asked President Biden to pull out American troops?  PRESIDENT ERDOĞAN: Such a thing never happened. We are not using such definitions because they would be insincere and these would be just allegations and lies. Turkey has never used such remarks talking to President Trump, and we never talked about these issues with President Biden back in Brussels.  MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to go back to Afghanistan. Turkey is helping the Taliban to run the airport right now, providing technical support. It's one of their few lifelines to the rest of the world. What do you think of this new Taliban government?  PRESIDENT ERDOĞAN: Currently, there's not an issue upon which we have reached an agreement, a consensus with Taliban. Taliban is currently moving jointly with Qatar and we have withdrawn our troops and our civilians were evicted--evacuated--excuse me. So, It's meaningless to talk about these things where we are not present because we're not currently at the airport and we don't have a cooperation outstanding with Taliban right now. But I need to be very frank and very clear in my following remarks. We have historic relations with the Afghan people, and we've always been very supportive of Afghan in an unprecedented fashion, unlike any other. And in terms of infrastructure, in terms of superstructure, we were involved in major investments, which we will continue for the future. But because of the mistakes made in the field, we had to withdraw our troops and evacuate our civilians. And right now, we are not present in Afghanistan.  MARGARET BRENNAN: You won't help to run the airports?  PRESIDENT ERDOĞAN: it will entirely depend on possible agreements and caution, because here, if we can reach a reciprocal understanding, if we can expect for some certain concrete steps and positive steps to be taken forward, we can do something right now. The government in Afghanistan is not inclusive, is not embracing all different factions. So long as that will be the question we won't be present in Afghanistan, but if the government shall be more inclusive, we can be there, present, as Turkey.  MARGARET BRENNAN: You said, it back in August, for sure, the Taliban's views won't be the same as they were 20 years ago. But the Taliban is only letting boys go back to school, not girls. They've told women not to show up for work in government positions. It doesn't look like the Taliban has evolved. Can you do business with a government like this?  PRESIDENT ERDOĞAN: Madam, Turkey's approach to women's issues is quite well known. Women are present in every aspect of life, in education, in health, in justice, in judiciary. Women are present in every aspect of life, so long as this is the situation in our country, why would we have a different stance in Afghanistan? (00:16:40) Our views would apply to Afghanistan as well as we would expect all women to be involved in every aspect of life in Afghanistan in a very active way. And whenever women become more active in every aspect of life, we can support them. If they would need us in health care and security and in other walks of life and if they need, we could support them in terms of education in our country.  MARGARET BRENNAN: It sounds like you don't want to do business with the Taliban at this point?  PRESIDENT ERDOĞAN: About the issues that I've just listed, if they shall be agreed on, if they will be accepted and recognized, we can do business, but if not, we won't do business with them.  MARGARET BRENNAN: You have Afghan refugees now fleeing the country. Some of them headed towards your country of Turkey. You said last month Turkey has no duty, responsibility or obligation to be a refugee warehouse. Whose obligation is it? Is it America's obligation to take in these refugees?  PRESIDENT ERDOĞAN: Right now... the United States failed to meet its obligations. Both registered and non-registered, we have more than 300,000 Afghan refugees- and- we will no longer be able to afford to welcome any more Afghan refugees in Turkey. However, the United States is- if the United States is willing to accept the Afghan refugees here, that's something they would know. I think they will understand my refugee politics and nobody would actually get intertwined.  MARGARET BRENNAN: What does that mean? Are you closing your borders to all refugees?  PRESIDENT ERDOĞAN: Currently, we are the ones housing 300,000 Afghan refugees, but I'm very clear in my remarks that our doors are not going to be the kind of doors that everybody can freely walk in and out of.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Does the U.S. need to do more?  PRESIDENT ERDOĞAN: Of course, the United States should do a lot and should invest a lot because the United States has been there for the last 20 years. But why? Why? First, these questions should be answered by the United States. The United States is not Turkey, it's a very powerful country, and this powerful country is feeding on this power and should have been capable of assessing the issue sociologically in Afghanistan, but why fail to do that? The armament in Afghanistan, for example, why was it made in the way it was made? Why so many bodyguards mobilized in Afghanistan? Why were they getting paid the amounts they were getting paid? Because we are not talking about peanuts here and all of these issues should be questioned by all of the Americans. And why did you enter the United States, why did you withd- why did you enter Afghanistan? Why did you withdraw from Afghanistan? And these are questions that should be posed by the Americans.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Did you pose these questions to President Biden back in June when you met face-to-face? Did you warn him (SOUND OFF CAM AND MB LOOKS AWAY BRIEFLY) that you saw potential problems?  PRESIDENT ERDOĞAN: The issues we discussed were mainly revolving around the airport,  the possible operation of the airport. We posed the relevant questions about the airport to President Biden--  MARGARET BRENNAN: and that's it?  PRESIDENT ERDOĞAN: --I said, if you want us to be present at the airport, we need logistical support from you, and administrative, financial support would be most welcome. And as a NATO partner, as an ally, we would jointly work with you in the field. That's what we said.  MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about that relationship. You're part of NATO, as is the United States. The Russian government says that Turkey plans to continue buying their missile defense systems, the S400s. The U.S. says it's a threat to this country, to the entire Western alliance. Why do you continue to go through with this? Did President Biden ask you to stop?  PRESIDENT ERDOĞAN: I explained everything to President Biden and through you, I would like to once again state the following: We were acquiring F-35 aircraftS and we've paid $1.4 billion. But the $1.4 billion of payments which were delivered in return for the F-35s, led us to such a situation that we never got the F-35s and we requested to acquire Patriots, but we were never given Patriots. And when we were talking to President Trump about these issues way back when he said the following: ""Well, Turkey has paid $1.4 billion for 35s and why are we not giving them F-35s?"" And he said this right in front of the entire world press.And why the five aircrafts are not still being delivered? I paid my--  MARGARET BRENNAN: --they're not being delivered because you purchased the S-400s, and the United States has said that this would be a risk.  PRESIDENT ERDOĞAN: Well, nobody can- nobody can interfere with that. You're not going to give me Patriots. (00:23:41) And in terms of the defense--  MARGARET BRENNAN: --but, can you--  PRESIDENT ERDOĞAN: I'm- I'm going to possibly acquire defense systems from another country and nobody can get involved in this. Stoltenberg, of the NATO, secretary general, came up with the best statement. And he said, quote, ""We can't do anything about what our partners or where our partners are going to buy their defense systems and they could never interfere with,"" that was what he said. This is NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg.  MARGARET BRENNAN: But after the United States government says to you that this is a security risk for the United States and for the entire Western alliance, can't you understand that America has a hard time trusting you after that?  PRESIDENT ERDOĞAN: Well, sorry, then. This is what I'm going to say in return: who is going to share our security risks? It can be said to me, how are we going to take the necessary measures for security risks? Are we going to keep on expecting delivery of weapons from other countries that didn't give us those weapons?  MARGARET BRENNAN: But don't you trust your own air force?  PRESIDENT ERDOĞAN: It's not about the air force, it's not just Air Force. Defense systems are one thing, Air Force is another thing. Because right now in terms of Air Force, maybe the United States, won't- won't maintain the F-16 program. I don't have such a guarantee that the Americans will continue with the F-16 provision. If that will be interrupted, then we will be forced to take other measures.  MARGARET BRENNAN: So it sounds like you still intend to buy another round of these S-400s, of these Russian missile systems.  PRESIDENT ERDOĞAN: In the future, nobody will be able to interfere in terms of what kind of defense systems we acquire, from which country at what level. Nobody can interfere with that. We are the only ones to make such decisions. We are a country--  MARGARET BRENNAN: So the sanctions will stay on?  PRESIDENT ERDOĞAN: --with 84 million inhabitants and we are very resolute in terms of our defence systems and the necessary measures to be taken, and nobody can interfere with that.  MARGARET BRENNAN: That sounds like a yes.  PRESIDENT ERDOĞAN: Of course, of course, yes.  MARGARET BRENNAN: When we started this conversation, you talked about your political career and support for you. President Biden is a constant critic of human rights abuses. You said in your private conversations with him that he didn't bring them up in June. Has he ever asked you to improve your treatment of journalists, or anything specific?  PRESIDENT ERDOĞAN: No he didn't. And because we don't have any problems of that nature in terms of freedoms, Turkey is incomparably free.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that Committee to Protect Journalists says that you rank second only to China when it comes to jailing journalists. Worse than Iran. Worse than Saudi Arabia.  PRESIDENT ERDOĞAN: Well, sorry, then I won't accept this. And these associations, these unions--uh, statements, and disclosures are not shared by me, because Turkey doesn't have such a situation.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, human rights lawyers say you have a hundred thousand Turkish citizens who have been investigating just for insulting you.  PRESIDENT ERDOĞAN: Do you believe these?  MARGARET BRENNAN: International organizations, credible ones are coming out with these statements.  PRESIDENT ERDOĞAN: Well, I know those credible international organizations that have no credit for me—  MARGARET BRENNAN: The United States government has said these things, or at least they say them to us. You said President Biden never said this to you.  PRESIDENT ERDOĞAN: Well, you're being deceived actually, and you're led to believe. Are you looking at the source of these allegations? Are you researching these claims? Please do, if you're not.  MARGARET BRENNAN: You think the U.S. State Department is not credible when it criticizes human rights abuses in Turkey?  PRESIDENT ERDOĞAN: Well, I don't, because in order for me to believe that it's a credible claim or a statement, my country's organizations, actual findings are important, because everything is political, everything has become political and this political approach can never be shared or accepted by us.  MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm told we are running out of time, but I do want to ask you: Turkey needs to improve its relations with the West and with the United States. When you came to Washington in 2017, you were on camera when you were watching those protesters get beaten. Those American protesters. There were Secret Service officers who were injured as a result. Do you understand that in the eyes of the American public, that's completely unacceptable?  PRESIDENT ERDOĞAN: Well, sorry, but, they're- not the Secret Service. On the contrary, the Turkish citizens living in Turkey were attacked by the federalized terrorist organization members and they were supported by the American police. And I talked about this to the American authorities, and I just wanted them to see things for what they are. And as press members, please consider the attacks against the Turkish citizens.  MARGARET BRENNAN: But I'm talking about the video that was shown in households around this country when they turned on the evening news, they saw you stand there while those protesters were being beaten. Do you understand why that hurt Turkey?  PRESIDENT ERDOĞAN: I wasn't standing there. I wasn't standing there. (00:30:44)  I was just following the incidents, but I wasn't standing there. We need to be honest, we need to speak the truth.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Did you approve of it?  PRESIDENT ERDOĞAN: --And I was not inside that crowd.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Was that appropriate?  PRESIDENT ERDOĞAN: On the contrary, our citizens were attacked and the American security forces, aggressively attacked the Turkish citizens and I told this to the American authorities.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think what happened that day is appropriate?  PRESIDENT ERDOĞAN: It's impossible for me to say it was because my citizens were being attacked. And some of them were detained or were arrested here. How are we going to explain this?  MARGARET BRENNAN: More than a dozen and the U.S. government won't sell weapons to some of your personal security because of what happened that day.  PRESIDENT ERDOĞAN: Let me remind you of something. We need to be honest about many things, but there's no honesty here. The approach against my security forces are misleading steps of the administration here in the United States. And these security forces are not being brought to the United States anymore because this is not a fair approach. The holders of the power if they demonstrate an unjust and unfair approach, of course, our approach will be different in nature.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Lastly, the American public has decided it doesn't have the political will to be involved militarily in the Middle East anymore. What does that mean for you and your country?  PRESIDENT ERDOĞAN: Well, this is the approach of the Americans- of the American people. And there's nothing we can do about it. We're not going to just determine what will be done and we can decide what we are going to do in the Middle East and the United States will, in her lonesome, decide what they're going to do in the Middle East. But I'm just stating one fact. The United States is a NATO member, and Turkey is as well. And the United States will it be moving forward with the terrorist organizations or will it be moving forward with the friend and ally under the NATO roof. (00:34:05) I would prefer the second one, actually.  MARGARET BRENNAN: What does that mean?  PRESIDENT ERDOĞAN: Let me repeat. We are allies under the roof of NATO with the United States, and it has to decide whether it's going to move forward with Turkey or move (00:34:23)  forward with PKK, PYD, and YPG and other terrorist organizations as such. This is the main decision to be made.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Has the Biden administration told you that it has any intention of changing its policy towards its Kurdish allies in Syria and in Iraq?  PRESIDENT ERDOĞAN: We didn't have the opportunity to talk about these issues because we mainly focused on the Afghan- Afghani question. But, when I was speaking to my leader friend in the United States, I told them about the terrorist organizations such as PKK, PYD, YPG, including the Trump administration, and the thousands of weapons and our artillery and the ammunition. What are you going to do about this? And I never got a positive response about that issue.  MARGARET BRENNAN: So to be clear, do you want U.S. troops, the nine hundred that are left in Syria to stay or to go?  PRESIDENT ERDOĞAN: Of course, if I have the choice I would, I would want them to get out of Syria and Iraq. Just like the way they have withdrawn from Afghanistan. Because if we are going to service peace around the world, it's not-- it's no longer meaningful to remain in those parts of the world. We can just leave those people, leave those administrations to make up their own minds.  MARGARET BRENNAN: And leave it to Turkey to intercede into Syria? Can you guarantee that would happen without human rights abuses?  PRESIDENT ERDOĞAN: Let me be very clear, and frank: we will never remain where we are not wanted. We will never be present where we are not welcome. In Syria, we are currently building 100,000 units of brick homes. People and families were displaced and they were kicked out of their motherland and we are building these units for them there. And I wonder what the other countries are doing, and it's very important to see it.  MARGARET BRENNAN: And is that what you're going to talk to Vladimir Putin about?  PRESIDENT ERDOĞAN: We are talking about these facts with Putin.  MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm being told we have to wrap the interview, but thank you for your time, Mr. President.  PRESIDENT ERDOĞAN: And I would like to thank you. I hope that the United States, Russia, Iran, Turkey, both in Syria and Iraq, we can work together collectively for the peace of the people in those parts of the world.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Insha'Allah.","Transcript: Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on ""Face the Nation,"" September 26, 2021",false

Osman Kavala, 64, is a Turkish businessman, publisher and activist who has been detained for more than four years despite having never been convicted of a crime.  He was acquitted last year in connection to nationwide protests in 2013, but then rearrested in connection with the attempted military coup in 2016.  A joint statement calling for Mr Kavala's release was jointly issued this week by the US, France, Germany, Canada, Finland, Denmark, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway and Sweden.  ""The continuing delays in his trial, including by merging different cases and creating new ones after a previous acquittal, cast a shadow over respect for democracy, the rule of law and transparency in the Turkish judiciary system,"" the statement read.  Advertisement  The embassies of its signatories called for a ""just and speedy resolution to his case... in line with Turkey's international obligations and domestic laws"".  ""Noting the ruling of the European Court of Human Rights on the matter, we call for Turkey to secure his urgent release,"" it added.  Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 3:06 Erdogan vows traitor crackdown after failed coup  The ECHR called for Mr Kavala's immediate release two years ago, finding that there was no reasonable suspicion that he had committed an offence and accusing Turkey of detaining him for the purpose of silencing him.  The Council of Europe, the 47-member human rights body which drafted and now upholds the European Convention of Human Rights, said it would begin infringement proceedings against Turkey if Mr Kavala wasn't released.  In response to the joint statement, President Erdogan told a crowd on Saturday that the foreign ambassadors ""cannot dare to come to the Turkish foreign ministry and give orders"".  He said: ""I gave the necessary order to our foreign minister and said what must be done. These 10 ambassadors must be declared persona non grata at once. You will sort it out immediately.  ""They will know and understand Turkey,"" Mr Erdogan added of the ambassadors, telling the cheering crowd in the city of Eskisehir: ""The day they do not know and understand Turkey, they will leave.""  A host state may declare foreign ambassadors persona non grata (Latin for ""person not welcome"") ""at any time and without having to explain its decision"" under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.  Doing so is usually a mechanism to expel the ambassador by stripping them of diplomatic immunity, but no official notification of the declaration has yet been received by the embassies involved.  Seven of the ambassadors represent fellow NATO members and their expulsion threatens to create the most significant rift between Turkey and the West in Erdogan's 19 years in power.  Six of them belong to EU members, and the European Parliament President David Sassoli tweeted: ""The expulsion of ten ambassadors is a sign of the authoritarian drift of the Turkish government. We will not be intimidated. Freedom for Osman Kavala.""

Chris Sweeney is an author and columnist who has written for newspapers such as The Times, Daily Express, The Sun and the Daily Record, along with several international-selling magazines.  Don’t like wearing masks? Neither does Benjamin Glynn. But his refusal to wear one, on account of his failure to accept Singapore’s right to make them legally mandatory, saw him treated like a terrorist, as he tells RT.  The return leg of Benjamin Glynn’s daily commute turned his life upside down. Violent arrests, a prison sentence and time in a mental institution followed, but he vowed, “I would do it all again, I don’t regret anything.”  Living in Singapore, the Brit and his partner decided to return home with their two kids, booking flights for May 31. On keen runner Glynn’s final day at work, he went for a run with colleagues, followed by a few drinks. On the train home, a passenger videoed him not wearing a Covid mask – contrary to the local rules – and uploaded it to citizen journalism website Stomp.  Twenty-four hours later, he said, the police knocked on his door, demanding he come to the station. Glynn said, “I was happy to have a chat with them. I just thought it would be a conversation and I could go talk to them on the Monday, but they insisted they had to take me then. I objected to that, as it was so late; it was my daughter’s fifth birthday. But that’s when the nightmare began.”  According to Glynn, things turned ugly, and officers used batons which led to an ambulance being called as he was, he says, bleeding from his knees, elbows and shoulders.  Glynn recalls he spent the rest of the weekend in holding cells, which he described as “horrendous.” There was a concrete floor with no bedding and the lights were on constantly. Tiredness saw him hallucinating. He was finally granted bail.  The rest of the family flew to the UK, but he had to remain for a scheduled court date on July 23. And worse was to follow. He explained, “On July 19, five of them [police] came bursting into my room. I hid in the bathroom and recorded it on my phone. They gave me no choice and dragged me out.”  It was at this point things turned “quite dark,” Glynn claims. Bail was revoked; Glynn was back in the concrete police cells and then transferred to Changi prison, he said.  “I’m probably the only person in the history of Singapore who was happy about going to prison. I thought it can’t be any worse. But I still had no bed, it was a thin bamboo mat on the floor and itchy blanket,” he recalled.  Throughout all of this, Glynn insists that he had been clear – he admitted not wearing a mask on the train. But by now he was facing four charges; two of not wearing a mask, one for being a public nuisance and one for using threatening language to the police.  His account continues: “I admitted the whole time that it was me not wearing a mask. My defence was based on the law and who has jurisdiction over who. Is it a criminal action or is it a civil regulation breach?”  He accepts that employers have the legal right to tell their staff to wear masks, but does not agree the state can issue such demands legally. However, Glynn believed that, as a foreigner, he was exempt from Singapore's laws on wearing masks.  Several of his comments in court attracted attention, wrongly, he believes, giving the impression he wasn’t taking his predicament seriously. That, Glynn points out, was despite him attending some appearances in handcuffs, ankle bracelets and while chained to a chair.  He added, “I was quite aware of the law and what a crime is, and isn’t. But I just assumed that because Singapore was a British colony and the British set up their legal system, they would have some respect for common law. But it turns out they have absolutely zero recognition for the living man or living woman.”  Also on rt.com UK citizen set to be deported from Singapore after being handed prison sentence for refusing to wear a mask  Glynn alleges that asking the judge three times at one hearing to name which law states the public must wear masks seemingly angered the authorities, and that he was sent to the Institute of Mental Health for psychiatric assessment.  That was even tougher than Changi prison, where at least he was able to read and have personal items, the British expat said.  About that hospital stay, Glynn said “It was a horrible cell with a small grille, no windows, and I wasn’t allowed anything – no toilet paper, books or toothbrush. I just had two weeks of staring at a wall in the isolation ward, where the really poorly people with mental problems are.  “This is how they deal with people who challenge their legal system and government, but it’s not just in Singapore,” the Briton alleged, “I’m sure people in other countries have also been accused of having mental problems if they refuse to comply with the Covid regulations.”  Throughout the process, Glynn says, the judiciary offered him deals to plead guilty. But Glynn refused them all, explaining, “That’s not really how justice works, you don’t condemn someone to prison before the trial and sweet-talk them out of it.”  In the end, he was found guilty on all charges but had served enough time, so was deported a few days later. And even that became a saga, he says, because as he was brought to the gate in shackles, KLM – with whom Glynn had bought his original ticket – refused to take him. Singapore Airlines did the same, but the British High Commission said he could travel on British Airways.  The nightmare ended when the British jet’s wheels touched down at Heathrow, but Glynn feels he has been unfairly portrayed, particularly given that what sparked the secret video was him assisting an elderly gentleman onto the train, who had been struggling to breathe in his mask, he claims. After helping the man to a seat, Glynn was approached by others about not wearing one himself. “I’ve been treated in my opinion like some sort of terrorist and as a criminal,” he believes.  Also on rt.com Fukushima nuclear plant to construct UNDERSEA tunnel to release a million tons of treated water  While he would not wish to relive the incident, Glynn does feel it exposed bigger issues. He said, “It was unfortunate but I was standing up for my rights. I don’t believe in wearing masks. I stood up for my rights not to wear a mask, which is recognised in every major country apart from Singapore by the sounds of it. My case has highlighted a lot of unfairness in the Singapore legal system.”  And, while he claims he had been “psychologically tortured,” he’s keen to put it behind him, saying, “I’m not some crazy freedom fighter who wants to neglect my family or my career to keep on doing this.”  Glynn has been lambasted in some quarters but has also received lots of messages of support. So, what does he take away from this bizarre experience?  “I think it showed Singapore is not safe, and the police have no respect or regard for human rights,” he said.  After spending a week in the countryside since returning home, Glynn appears relaxed and ready to move on. He admitted, “It’s just so good to be back on English soil and the land of the free.”  Think your friends would be interested?

The PML-N’s criticism on it is beyond comprehension,” he said in a news release while reacting to PML-N Spokesperson Marriyum Aurangzeb’s statement.  “There will be no restriction on media freedom [with establishment of PMDA,” Farrukh said while lashing out at those who were trying to mislead the people with interpretation of PMDA according to their own whims.  He criticized the opposition for resorting to political point-scoring on the PMDA without reading draft of its framework.  Farrukh chided Marriyum for criticizing the PMDA and said she did not even bother to attend joint meeting of the Standing Committee on Information and Broadcasting.  He said all the media forums including All Pakistan Newspapers Society (APNS), Council of Pakistan Newspaper Editors (CPNE), Pakistan Broadcasters Association (PBA), press clubs and other stakeholders had been made part of the consultative process.  All the stakeholders assured full support on the steps that would ensure journalists and media workers’ job security and in-time salaries and regulation of digital media, he added.  He said in the past, it was tradition of enacting laws overnight, adding it was the present government which had set a precedent of holding consultation with stakeholders before drafting laws.  Farrukh said everybody including media knew as to how the PML-N dealt with media during their tenure of government in the country.  The minister said the PMDA framework was being developed in the same manner that the developed countries had adopted to deal with the challenges stemming from the evolutionary process of media.  He said the PMDA would not only regulate digital media and develop the industry in an effective manner, but also ensure freedom of expression and protection of journalists’ rights. It would also ensure job security and in-time issuance of salaries of journalists and media workers, he added.  The PMDA was meant for bringing all the concerned agencies under one umbrella to facilitate the journalists and workers of all forms of the media in an efficient manner, Farrukh noted.  He said previously, there was no platform for resolution of electronic media’s journalists and workers’ problems.  The minister said the PMDA was being set up to make media-related institutions more efficient and effective. The present government firmly believed in freedom of the media and expression as enshrined in Article 19 of the Constitution.  In the past, he said there were instances when the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf fully participated in the movements launched for independence of the judiciary and media in the country.",Farrukh describes PML-N's criticism on PMDA as 'unfounded',mixture

He added that Iran expects Russia to be sensitive to any potential changes in the borders in the region and the presence of terrorists and movements of the Zionist regime that threaten regional peace and stability.  The remarks came in reaction to recent developments along Iran’s northwestern borders and the latest remarks by Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev.  Iran launched a drill, codenamed Fatehan-e Kheybar (Conquerors of Khaybar), in the northwest of the country on Friday, in line with efforts to boost its defense and deterrent capabilities in the face of potential threats.  Aliyev criticized the drills, but Iran reiterated that it reserves the right, just like any other sovereign country, to hold military exercises inside its territory to test and maintain its preparedness.  Amir-Abdollahian said the Republic of Azerbaijan has held six maneuvers with some foreign parties, but Iran held only one exercise.  In addition to the presence of Daesh terrorists in the region, Iran has been suspicious of Azerbaijan’s links to the Israeli regime, too.  Elsewhere in the presser, Amir-Abdollahian said, Iran and Russia “have agreed to discuss a treaty on strategic cooperation in the future, and soon, we will have a draft and we will issue a road map that will be the basis of our long-term cooperation.”  He lauded the bilateral ties between the two countries but underlined the need to “make a leap” in the promotion of cooperation.  He also praised his “fruitful” talks with his Russian counterpart on regional issues, including Afghanistan, Syria, Yemen and the Palestinian issue.  “We support the establishment of an inclusive government with all stakeholders included,” he commented on Afghanistan.  He also said that Tehran was ready to make arrangements for Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Rafael Grossi for a visit to Tehran.  “We welcome any visit by the IAEA head to follow up on technical issues,” Amir-Abdollahian said, but expressed Iran’s dismay over the failure of the UN nuclear agency to condemn the terrorist incident at a nuclear facility in Karaj in north-central Iran.  For his part, Lavrov said he discussed with his Iranian counterpart specific ways to expand cooperation between the two countries “in bilateral projects based on the agreements achieved on the highest level.”  “We have a stable growth of trade, which despite the COVID-19 pandemic and sanctions increased by 42 percent” this year, he said, adding, “We have agreed to boost our economic cooperation further and develop economic ties.”  He also rejected US push for a West-style world order, stressing, “We oppose the rules-based world order that is promoted by the US and its Western allies that are trying to impose [it] on all international players.”  On the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, the top Russian diplomat underscored the necessity for the implementation by all sides of UN Security Council resolution 2231 that endorses the agreement.  He also said the talks in Vienna aimed at reviving the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) should be resumed as quickly as possible.  He echoed Iran’s stances that expect the US to resume its obligations according to the Iranian deal, but dismissed Washington’s expectation of Tehran to make certain changes so the US would re-enter the deal.  “As for the expectations of the US that Iran should make certain changes for the US to re-enter the deal, it is something that we do not accept and that Iran does not accept,” Lavrov said.  He also said Iran and Russia see eye to eye over the fact that the US worsened the situation in Afghanistan in the past 20 years.  “Both countries believe that the people of Afghanistan have suffered a lot over the two decades of political experiments carried out by the US,” he said, adding that the Afghans “have the right to freely decide the future of their land.”  “We believe that political stabilization is important to reach this goal,” he further commented.

85,118493736391039779464650400996285038769,"While watching reports from the Alba Party women’s conference that took place this afternoon, we saw something that we thought must be wrong.  But it wasn’t.  ILGA World – the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association – is an organisation that we hadn’t heard of until today. Just over a year ago they released, as part of a 200-member caucus of other groups, something called “The Feminist Declaration”. It’s a mostly-innocuous document of demands about women’s rights, but buried in the middle of it is a very disturbing section.  The World Health Organisation defines “adolescents” as people aged from 10 to 19.  So the only possible interpretation of “end the criminalization of adolescents’ sexuality” is a reduction in the age of consent to 10 years old. Indeed, a slightly earlier paragraph of the Declaration is more explicit about it:  ”Eliminate all laws and policies that punish or criminalize same-sex intimacy, gender affirmation, abortion, HIV transmission non-disclosure and exposure, or that limit the exercise of bodily autonomy, including laws limiting legal capacity of adolescents, people with disabilities or other groups to provide consent to sex”  While it doesn’t go into more detail, one would like to imagine that the intent would be to remove laws limiting capacity for consent only within that age group, ie to make it legal for all adolescents to have sex with each other, rather than to let older people have sex with them. But it doesn’t actually say that anywhere.  Even if it did, alert readers will note that that would still make it legal for 19-year-olds to have sex with 10-year-olds, and to put it very mildly that seems a somewhat controversial position.  So who are the organisations signing up to this “feminist” demand under the ILGA umbrella? On its list of member organisations, sure enough, appear the names of LGBT Youth Scotland and Stonewall Scotland.  Just 12 years ago LGBT Youth Scotland was at the centre of Scotland’s biggest ever paedophile scandal, with its chief executive James Rennie sentenced to life imprisonment for a string of offences.  So it seems remarkable that (a) it appears to be set on embroiling itself in such a contentious demand, and (b) that the Scottish Government is funding it with taxpayers’ money to do so, even allowing for the fact that until 2017 one of LGBTYS’ directors was SNP MP Alyn “Daddy Bear” Smith.  So we must apologise to Margaret Lynch – who penned an excellent article for this very website just days ago – for even momentarily doubting what she told the Alba women’s conference. It appears that it’s entirely true – the SNP are indeed paying lobby groups with your money to try to reduce the age of consent in Scotland to 10.  We wish we could be confident that the danger of that actually happening was only theoretical.",Wings Over Scotland,false
86,152560620072367015359812149597447873853,"Authorities in Scotland have officially listed the Covid-19 vaccine as the underlying cause in multiple deaths according to official records.  National Records of Scotland (NRS), the equivalent of the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in England have listed three deaths occurring before the 30th April 2021 “with the underlying cause of death being due to adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccines”. The official statistic can be viewed on table 12 of the downloadable excel document via the NRS website here.  This of course has not made headline news in the mainstream media as it would destroy the narrative that the authorities have built to persuade every adult to take an experimental, unnecessary jab via psychological warfare, propaganda, and ostrasisation of the ‘experimental vaccine hesitant’.  So what better way is there to counter the officially listed vaccine deaths than to continue the psychological warfare by rolling-out a behavioural scientist and dress them up as a “Public Health expert”? Because that is exactly what the Scottish Government have done.  Here’s BBC Scotland’s version of the authorities response to the listed vaccines deaths –  Public health expert Prof Linda Bauld said the “vast, vast majority” of Covid vaccine side effects were very mild.  The professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh told BBC Scotland that serious adverse effects from any vaccine were extremely unusual.  “The vast, vast majority of side effects from the Covid vaccines are very mild. You do have severe cases, but only very rarely,” she said.  “We have been aware of the rare blood clots that we think are linked to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine… but it’s not always possible to say the vaccine caused it. There may be other contributory factors.”  What qualifications does Professor Linda Bauld have to make her a “Public Health expert”? She has a PhD in ‘Social Policy’ and a Bachelor’s degree in ‘Political Science’. Why is a behavioural scientist considered as a “Public Health expert”? Because the past 14 months have had nothing to do with a virus, they’ve been entirely about control.  As for the vast majority of side effects from the Covid vaccine being mild, do you consider suffering a stroke mild? Do you consider going blind mild? Do you consider suffering a seizure mild? Do you consider being paralysed mild? Because these are the adverse reactions that are being reported to the MHRA Yellow Card scheme, with a significant amount of strokes being reported as of the latest update at the time of writing which includes reports made to and officially recorded by the MHRA up to the 12th May 2021.  The data shows that 34 people have gone blind after having the Pfizer jab, however the AstraZeneca jab has performed significantly worse with 176 reporting that they have gone blind after having the experimental jab.  Why are people going blind? Most likely as a result of suffering a stroke, with a vast array of different types of stroke being suffered. As of the 12th May the number of cerebrovascular accidents had increased by 6272.73% in just 15 weeks to a total of 701, with 32 of these sadly resulting in death. The number of ischaemic strokes also went up, increasing by 8300% to a total of 84. There had also been 122 cerebral haemorrhages, 57 cerebral infarctions, 74 subarachnoid haemorrhages, and 40 intracranial haemorrhages, among many others.  The MHRA have also confirmed that they have received 56 reports of death out of 309 reports of thrombo-embolic events with concurrent thromocytopenia for the AstraZeneca vaccine, 7 of which occurred in people aged 18 -29. However they don’t go as far as to list the vaccine as the definitive cause, instead adding the caveat that “it is not clear if this is a coincidence or side effect from the vaccine”.  The fact that National Records of Scotland have officially listed the experimental Covid-19 vaccines as the cause of death is a game-changer, but it will of course be swept under the carpet. But the number of deaths is in fact significantly higher, with 1,180 deaths listed in the MHRA Yellow Card scheme report as of the 12th May 2021.  But we also can’t forget the freedom of information request made to Public Health Scotland back in February in which a person asked –  “Could you please provide the total number of deaths for any reason within 28 days of having a Covid vaccine from the start of the vaccination roll out date?”  To which Public Health Scotland confirmed –  “Using the latest mortality data available (Up to 26th February), 2,207 people have died within 28 days of vaccination (number of days between vaccine and death is 0-27 where 0 is the day of vaccination).”  Will you be having the experimental jab?",Covid-19 Vaccine officially listed as the underlying cause of death multiple times by Scotland Authorities,mixture
87,58043135057254945490991034268901968178,"I welcome this opportunity to provide an update on the awarding of qualifications this year.  It is a privilege, as well as a huge responsibility, to have returned to the portfolio at such a critical time for Scottish education. The exceptional level of collaboration in supporting our learners, particularly during the pandemic, has been striking. I am determined that such constructive engagement be maintained.  Ensuring that our young people are kept safe and are able to achieve fair and credible grades in spite of the most challenging of school years has been, and remains, this Government’s absolute priority. I take very seriously the anxiety and concern that some young people, parents and teachers have voiced about the approach that is being taken—an approach that I and key stakeholders across our system firmly believe to be the fairest possible for our young people, in the challenging circumstances that result from the pandemic.  In responding to the concerns that I have heard, my statement will restate key principles about the model, provide detail on the support that is available to learners, set out how this year’s appeals process will work to support learners, acknowledge work to safeguard opportunities for this year’s learners to progress to further and higher education, and provide an update concerning the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development review of the curriculum.  The disruption that has been generated by the Covid-19 pandemic has caused this year’s national 5, higher and advanced higher exams to be cancelled. The national qualifications 2021 group was established in October 2020, with representatives of teachers, learners and parents working alongside local authorities, the Scottish Qualifications Authority and the Government to ensure that the hard work of learners can be fairly acknowledged.  The g roup agreed and co-produced the model for this year, using its members’ insight and expertise. Education partners continue to support the approach.  Let me be clear about the assessment process itself. At the heart of the model are teachers’ and lecturers’ professional judgments, which are based on what learners have demonstrated that they have attained. Those judgments alone, based on learners’ work, will this year determine the grades that young people receive. Those grades will be based not on historical data or on use of an algorithm, but on what each individual learner has demonstrated that they know, understand and can do, through the work on which they have been assessed in school or college. That is the key difference this year, compared with what happened last year. My key message to reassure learners is this: your grades will be judged by your teachers, based on your work.  I am enormously grateful for the efforts of our teachers, lecturers and others in schools and colleges who are implementing the model in order to ensure fairness for all learners. To provide evidence of how the model is being implemented locally, Her Majesty’s inspectors of education today published a review of local authority quality-assurance processes. The key findings from the review provide independent evidence that the model is working well in practice, with local authority officers, headteachers, teachers and SQA co-ordinators having collaborated to ensure that young people’s efforts are appropriately recognised, and with local authorities having supported schools to implement the model to reflect their local contexts while working within a national framework.  Despite the best efforts, a very small number of learners who completed courses have over recent weeks, in particular, experienced significant disruption that has meant that they have been unable to complete their assessments. Contingency arrangements, on which the national qualifications 2021 group is publishing details today, are in place for later certification for that group.  I fully appreciate that there are people who disagree with the model that has been put in place. However, to them I say that teachers, learners, and parents and carers have been listened to, and that the model is the result of that. Awarding qualifications would always be challenging under the current circumstances, but we believe that the model that we have is the fairest solution in the interests of young people. That is not just my conclusion; it is that of the national qualifications 2021 group, too.  That is not to dismiss in any way the concerns and anxiety that have been expressed by some learners and parents who are experiencing implementation of the model at first hand. As a result, I am announcing today a package of support measures for those learners. Many of the supports are available now, and others will be added in the coming weeks. To date, we have provided more than £400 million in additional funding to local authorities to support schools to cope with and recover from the effects of Covid. That includes more digital devices, additional staffing and wider support.  We have continued to support schools and local authorities to deliver their vital role in supporting children and young people’s mental health and wellbeing. However, we recognise that young people might need further support, so a letter will be sent to the home address of every learner who is taking national qualifications, outlining the support that is available and providing links to online resources and helpline numbers.  Learners may well have questions regarding their progression beyond school. For those who will continue within education, the SQA, the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service and college and university advice lines will be there to provide support. Learners who are moving into employment can draw support from Skills Development Scotland’s advisers. We are also working with YoungScot, whose people will, as experts in successfully communicating with learners, promote the support that is available, through their social media feeds and website.  Every effort has been made to ensure that the hard work of learners is fairly acknowledged in the first instance, with learners getting the right result first time, but the appeals process is an important final stage in the certification process. The SQA will today publish details of that process. I confirm that the approach will, for the first time, include a direct right of appeal for learners, which I am sure will be welcomed by learners and their representatives.  It is right that in these exceptional times, there is, for those who consider that they have not received the right result, a broad mechanism through which to appeal, and that the mechanism is free at the point of use. To ensure fairness and credibility, the grounds for appeal are disagreement with the centre’s quality-assured academic judgment, contested administrative or procedural error within the SQA or the examining centre, and appeals that are related to the Equality Act 2010, including on assessment arrangements.  Education stakeholders have been clear that demonstrated attainment is a key principle in ensuring the credibility and fairness of qualifications. Appeal decisions will therefore be evidence based and symmetric, which means that grades can move down, move up or stay the same, depending on the review of the evidence.  I recognise that some stakeholders are not supportive of that position and seek an approach in which grades cannot go down. Although I am sympathetic to the position of learners this year, awards must ultimately be based on the actual attainment of pupils. That means that the subject specialist who looks at an appeal must be able to give their true judgment of a pupil’s attainment and to move the grade in line with the evidence. In that way, the appeals system will be fair, consistent and credible.  Without symmetry, there would not be a full and fair review of the evidence. That could be perceived as being unfair to other learners and could raise questions about the credibility of this year’s qualifications. In adopting a symmetrical approach to appeals, judgments at appeal will be made based only on an individual learners’ work, not on an algorithm or the school’s past performance. Although formal processing of appeals will not start until learners have received their results on 10 August, learners will be able to indicate their intention to appeal from late June, when provisional results are submitted. Support will be in place for learners over the period.  Our learners also need reassurance that, having received their grades, those who wish to continue their learner journey will be able to do so. We understand that the changes to the SQA process last year and this year might impact on students who are looking to undertake courses in Scotland’s colleges and universities in the new academic year. We will, via the Scottish Funding Council, continue to provide additional support to our institutions to ensure that students are able to take up places that they would not have secured without additional places being made available.  In 2020-21, the SFC provided universities with an additional 1,297 places for students who had been impacted by the SQA changes. In 2021-22, we will continue to fund those places while also having made provision for more additional places—currently estimated to be around 2,500—for new students. Colleges have also been supported to deliver additional flexibility within their courses.  The Covid-19 pandemic has presented unprecedented challenges for our education system. It has sparked debate about the future of assessment and qualifications and about the best way to recognise learners’ achievements and equip them with the skills that they require to succeed on whatever path they choose.  Members will be aware that we extended the remit of the OECD’s review—to analysis of Scotland’s approach to assessment and qualifications and to development of options to enhance our approach. That work is on-going and will be published by the OECD in early autumn. However, I confirm that the OECD will publish its main report on the review of curriculum for excellence before then, on 21 June 2021. I look forward to discussing its findings with Parliament before the summer recess.  I relish the prospect of exploring a wide range of reform opportunities that will further improve Scottish education, but my immediate focus remains on ensuring that we do right by all the learners who are taking national qualifications this year. I reassure Parliament that everything is being done to ensure that the hard work of learners is recognised fairly, at a time that will, naturally, be anxious and stressful for many learners and their families. I ask members to acknowledge the merits of the approach that is being taken and to play their part in reassuring and supporting learners during these challenging times.",National Qualifications 2021,mixture

89,151839726124589967947469415450837062750,"“The vaccines are incredibly safe. They protect us against Omicron; they protect us against Delta; they protect us against COVID."" Those were the words of fully vaccinated CDC Director Rochelle Walensky while testifying before the Senate Health Committee with two masks on her face on Jan. 11.  Scottish data shows that the COVID-19 age-standardized case rate is highest among the two-dose vaccinated and lowest among unvaccinated! It further shows this trend of negative efficacy for the double-vaccinated persisting for hospitalizations and deaths. Something is very wrong here, and together with other data points, it raises concerning questions about the negative effect of waning antibodies, constant boosting, and the consequences of a leaky vaccine with narrow-spectrum suboptimal antibodies against an ever-evolving virus.  Every Wednesday, Public Health Scotland (PHS) has been publishing a weekly report on COVID data juxtaposed to vaccination rates. Table 14 of this week’s “Public Health Scotland COVID-19 & Winter Statistical Report” lays bare in plain English (and math) a rate of negative efficacy for the vaccine:  As you can see, while the overall Omicron wave seems to be receding in Scotland, age-standardized case rates per 100,000 people were the lowest in the unvaccinated cohort every week for the past four weeks. Thus, it’s not just the fact that the unvaccinated accounted for only 11.5% of cases the past two weeks, but even adjusted for age-stratified vaccination rates (PHS already does the math for you) the unvaccinated had the lowest infection rate out of the four cohorts – especially during the peak of Omicron. Furthermore, we see that even the triple-vaccinated clearly have no efficacy against infection, although they have some degree less negative efficacy than the double-vaccinated.  Here is a linear presentation of the depth of the Omicron wave by vaccination status, where you can see that the unvaccinated had the shallowest wave:  This also coincides with the latest data from the U.K. Health Security Agency of the entire United Kingdom. This data now shows higher rates of infection among the triple-vaccinated in all but the youngest people.  Full stop right here. Any public policy measure – from vaccine passports to discrimination – cannot be justified under the science, even if one’s conscience is OK with apartheid. In fact, clearly this shows that, especially with Omicron, the vaccinated are the super-spreaders. Before we get to hospitalizations and deaths, the notion that the unvaccinated are somehow responsible for the continued spread of this virus is completely contradicted by the data. Some might suggest without evidence that the unvaccinated possibly have a higher rate of prior infection; however, Omicron seems to attack even those who already had previous versions of SARS-CoV-2.  Now onto hospitalizations and deaths. While the vaccines clearly provided some degree of protection for some people for several months against severe illness (while possibly causing even more spread), the Scottish data paints a concerning picture of the long-term consequences of the mass vaccination. People like Dr. Geert Vanden Bossche have been warning that if you mass-vaccinate with a leaky, narrow-spectrum (only recognizes spike protein) vaccine in middle of a raging pandemic, the virus would get more virulent over time.  This concern manifests itself at two time periods when the antibodies are “sub-optimal.” There is a period of a few weeks after the jab when the antibodies are strong enough to bind but not strong enough to neutralize, and then at the back end (estimated at four to six months for the original shot, but likely much shorter for the booster), a period when they wane. The media and public health tyrants like to focus your attention on a snapshot of time, but ignore the totality of circumstances that the shots are creating negative efficacy before and after, while using accounting gimmicks to mask the problem.  Remember how the lockdowns were hailed as a success for a number of countries that initially did well, while Sweden now has the lowest rate of excess mortality in Europe in 2021?  Just as with lockdowns, the mass vaccination needs to be judged after all nine innings of the ballgame.  With that said, let’s take a look at tables 15 and 16 – the acute COVID hospitalization and death rates, respectively:  What is clearly evident both from the hospitalizations and deaths is that the double-vaccinated are now worse off per capita even against critical illness, and that pattern appears to be accelerating. Again, this evidently shows a pattern of negative efficacy even against critical illness over time as the shots wear off, increasingly quickly with Omicron. Why is there no desire to study the source of this negative efficacy and whether the fact that the vaccine is non-sterilizing, wanes quickly with sub-optimal antibodies, is narrow-spectrum, and is increasingly out of synch with the changing virus is going to make the pandemic worse in the long run?  Some will look at the chart and conclude that the boosters are amazing. But first it’s important to recognize that even the boosters don’t stop transmission at all even in the short run, and then, based on the latest hospitalization data, appear to wane just like the original shots. Relatedly, you will notice a pattern: the unvaccinated and two-dose cohorts always appear worse and the one-shot and three-shot cohorts always appear better. This is where the most important part of the data set comes into play.  You see, all cases during the first 21 days after the first shot are counted in the “unvaccinated” cohort, while the first 14 days after one receives the 3rd shot is counted among the two-dose cohort. See the definitions from Appendix 6 of the report.  We know from numerous studies (see here and here) that people are actually the most vulnerable to COVID during the first few weeks on the upswing of the antibodies, when T cells are likely suppressed. This is why the health departments smartly count them in the unvaccinated pile. Hence, for all these months, all the cases and deaths from those made more vulnerable from the first shot – which is caused by the mass vaccination, not the unvaccinated – are counted against the unvaccinated. Over time, as the shots waned on the back end, the truth became evident. Now they are starting the cycle all over again by making the two-dose group look even worse than they are by dumping all of the cases caused by the initial take-up from the third dose into the cohort of double-vaccinated.  It’s the ultimate pandemic Ponzi scheme. Just wait another two months and see what the fourth-shot group looks like relative to the triple-dosers, as the immediate vaccination causes an even greater spike in cases. In other words, you have to look in totality where we are headed rather than manipulating a snapshot of time.  What this report shows is that just 18.5% of the hospitalizations in Scotland were unvaccinated, but even that number includes numerous people within 21 days of the first shot, which is clearly a very vulnerable time. It’s akin to telling someone in a foxhole to run across the field of fire to get to a bunker that might be safer, but he runs an even higher risk of getting cut down before reaching the bunker. Then, after a few hours, the bunker will get overrun by the enemy and you have to run through a new field of fire to get to the next bunker.  Likewise, when a therapeutic lowers symptom severity through immune suppression, it’s a flash in the pan. Eventually, that mechanism of action will come back to bite you in the proverbial arm. And this is even before we get to the long-term concern that multiple shots will create permanent immune suppression by creating original antigenic sin, a position now articulated by the European Medicines Agency and top Israeli immunologists.    Just how prominent is the infection rate within the first 14-21 days of getting the shot, thereby completely distorting the epidemiological data and ultimate perception of efficacy of the shots? Although we don’t have data from the U.K. or U.S. on the timing of infection relative to vaccination period, Alberta, Canada evidently publishes some of that data. According to U.K. researcher Joel Smalley, who screenshotted the chart from the Alberta government’s website before it was taken down, roughly 40% of cases, 47.6% of hospitalizations, and 56% of deaths among the vaccinated occurred within 14 days of vaccination ! Here is the graphical presentation that was on the website, according to Smalley. The top chart represents cases, the middle is hospitalizations, and the bottom is deaths:  Alberta, like many governments, counts the first 14 days as unvaccinated. In Scotland, they are counting the first 21 days after the first dose as unvaccinated and 14 days following subsequent doses in the cohort of the previous numbered dose. Obviously, we can’t mix the Alberta time-based data with the overall Scottish data, but common sense dictates that a bunch of cases from the immune suppression period of the initial vaccination are being blamed on the unvaccinated, and the perception of the booster shots is also likely being ameliorated at the expense of the double-jabbed cohort. For example, in Alberta, it appears that roughly 60% of the hospitalizations in the vaxxed cohort got COVID within 21 days of the shot, which in Scotland, would all be counted as unvaccinated cases. Thus, they deliberately chose the cutoff date for designation of vax status after the inflection point where they see the most COVID cases post-vax!  This deep dive into the data from Scotland should serve as a Rosetta stone for the macro observations we have seen from day one. We are seeing the most vaccinated nations and states being hammered with more cases than ever in a way that defies anything we should expect to see from a safe and effective vaccine. Here are just a few of the many examples:  Dr. Fauci recently told Bloomberg news that “there are some inherent ‘non-believers’ that no matter what you say, they give you a real problem.” He’s right. It takes a true religious level of adherence – like a believer – to continue supporting his narrative, despite the plain facts before our every eyes.",Horowitz: The very concerning data from Scotland,false

Source  On the 26th Jan 22, The Expose exclusively told you how Public Health Scotland data showed fully vaccinated individuals were up to 4 times more likely to die of Covid-19 than unvaccinated individuals.  The very next week, Public Health Scotland added a whole section on alleged vaccine effectiveness in their report as well as notes in red text stating the data should not be used to measure vaccine effectiveness.  This was clearly done in response to our report, and because they could no longer use their own data, as they have done for the past year, to show that the Covid-19 injections are effective.  But now, as we quitely predicted, Public Health Scotland have gone one step further, and have announced in their latest report that they will no longer publish the number of Covid-19 cases, hospitalisations, and deaths by vaccine status.  The reasons they’ve given are laughable, because they felt no need to come up with these tedious excuses when the hospitalisation and death rates were shown to be in the vaccines favour.  But we can reveal that the real reason Public Health Scotland will no longer publish the data, is because it clearly shows that the fully vaccination population are developing Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome.  One of the main reasons given by Public Health Scotland that their data is now unreliable, is because “vaccine effectiveness wanes over time”. But this is a lie, because vaccine effectiveness doesn’t wane. Immune System Performance does.  Vaccine effectiveness isn’t really a measure of a vaccine, it is a measure of a vaccine recipients immune system performance compared to the immune system performance of an unvaccinated person.  Vaccines allegedly help develop immunity by imitating an infection. Once the imitation infection induced by the vaccine goes away, the body is left with a supply of “memory” t-cells and antibodies that will remember how to fight that disease in the future.  So, when the authorities state that the effectiveness of the vaccines weaken over time, what they really mean is that the performance of your immune system weakens over time.  In regards to the Covid-19 injections –  A vaccine effectiveness of + 50% would mean that the fully vaccinated are 50% more protected against Covid-19 than the unvaccinated. In other words the fully vaccinated have an immune system that is 50% better at tackling Covid-19.  would mean that the fully vaccinated are 50% more protected against Covid-19 than the unvaccinated. In other words the fully vaccinated have an immune system that is 50% better at tackling Covid-19. A vaccine effectiveness of 0% would mean that the fully vaccinated are no more protected against Covid-19 than the unvaccinated, meaning the vaccines are ineffective. In other words the fully vaccinated have an immune system that is equal to that of the unvaccinated at tackling Covid-19.  But a vaccine effectiveness of -50% would mean that the unvaccinated were 50% more protected against Covid-19 than the fully vaccinated. In other words the immune system performance of the vaccinated is 50% worse than the natural immune system performance of the unvaccinated. Therefore, the Covid-19 vaccines have damaged the immune system.  With that being said it should come as no surprise to anyone as to why Public Health Scotland no longer wish to publish the Covid-19 data by vaccination status, because it clearly shows in all areas that the Covid-19 injections are proving to have a negative vaccine effectiveness, and therefore a negative immune system performance, which implies the fully vaccinated are developing Covid-19 vaccine induced Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (VAIDS).  In table 13 of the latest Covid-19 Statistical Report published Wednesday 16th Feb 22, PHS provide the number of Covid-19 cases by vaccination status.  The table, found on page 37, shows that the triple vaccinated accounted for the majority of Covid-19 cases between 15th Jan and 11th Feb, recording 13,833 cases in the week beginning 5th Feb alone.This compares to 5,201 cases among the double vaccinated, and 3,834 cases among the unvaccinated during the same week.  But the table also shows us the Covid-19 case rates per 100k population by vaccination status. We’ve extracted the data to produce the following chart –  As you can see, Covid-19 case-rates have remained highest among the double vaccinated over the past four weeks. But something peculiar has also happened. The case rates among the not-vaccinated have declines week on week, but the case rates among the triple vaccinated have increased week on week, now almost matching the case rate among the double vaccinated by the week ending 11th Feb.  Now that we know the case-rates, we can use Pfizer’s vaccine effectiveness formula to work out the real-world vaccine effectiveness, which don’t forget is really a measure of the immune system performance.  Unvaccinated case rate – Vaccinated case rate / Unvaccinated case rate = Immune System Performance  The following chart shows the real world immune system performance among teh double vaccinated and triple vaccinated population in Scotland between 15th Jan and 11th Feb 22 –  If the immune system performance was to hit the minus-100% barrier then this would suggest full blown Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. But unfortunately for both the double/triple vaccinated population they are well on their way to hitting the AIDS barrier.  As of the week ending 11th Feb 22, the immune system performance of the double vaccinated has reached minus-60.4%, whilst the immune system performance of the triple vaccinated has reached minus-55%.  This means the double vaccinated are down to the last 39.6% of their immune system to protect them against fighting viruses, bacteria, and cancers. Whilst the triple vaccinated are down to the last 45%.  However, it’s clear from the graph above that the decline in immune system performance has been much steeper among the triple vaccinated over the previous four weeks compared to the decline among the double vaccinated. This therefore suggests that every vaccination worsens the immune system degradation, and could mean the triple vaccinated surpass the AIDS barrier weeks before the double vaccinated do.  We can also see the fully vaccinated are showing a negative immune system performance against both hospitalisation and death.  Table 14 of the PHS Covid-19 Statistical Report can be found on page 41, and it contains the number of hospitalisations by vaccination status as well as the hospitalisation rates per 100k.  The following chart shows the hospitalisation rates by vaccination status among the unvaccinated and fully vaccinated population –  This translates into an immune system performance which is as follows –  Table 15 of the PHS Covid-19 Statistical Report can be found on page 47, and it contains the number of deaths by vaccination status as well as the death rates per 100k.  The following chart shows the death rates by vaccination status among the unvaccinated and fully vaccinated population –  This translates into an immune system performance which is as follows –  The lowest immune system performance against hospitalisation was recored in the week ending 11th Feb, hitting minus-81%. Whilst the lowest immune system performance against death was recorded in the week ending 21st Jan, hitting minus-116.48%, meaning the fully vaccinated passed the AIDS barrier.  However, because these figures are age standardised they are subject to fluctuations, which is why UKHSA data for England which breaks down the data by age groups, and also shows a negative immune system performance for hospitalisation and death, is a much better method of measuring the immune system performance.  But what this data from PHS does clearly show is that the fully vaccinated are more likely to be hospitalised with Covid-19, and more likely to die of Covid-19 than the unvaccinated population.  AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) is the name used to describe a number of potentially life-threatening infections and illnesses that happen when your immune system has been severely damaged.  People with acquired immune deficiency syndrome are at an increased risk for developing certain cancers and for infections that usually occur only in individuals with a weak immune system.  Public Health Scotland data clearly shows that the fully vaccinated are developing Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, and this is precisely why Public Health Scotland have made the decision to no longer publish the data going forward.

I don’t want to lose it.”  He said that going from the blue sky to the utter blackness of space was a moving experience: “In an instant you go, `Whoa, that’s death.′ That’s what I saw.”  Shatner became the oldest person in space, eclipsing the previous record — set by a passenger on a similar jaunt on a Bezos spaceship in July — by eight years. The flight included about three minutes of weightlessness and a view of the curvature of the Earth.  ADVERTISEMENT  Sci-fi fans reveled in the opportunity to see the man best known as the brave and principled commander of the starship Enterprise boldly go where no star of American TV has gone before. The internet went wild, with Trekkies quoting favorite lines from Kirk, including, “Risk: Risk is our business. That’s what this starship is all about.”  “This is a pinch-me moment for all of us to see Capt. James Tiberius Kirk go to space,” Blue Origin launch commentator Jacki Cortese said before liftoff. She said she, like so many others, was drawn to space by shows like “Star Trek.”  NASA sent best wishes ahead of the flight, tweeting: “You are, and always shall be, our friend.”  The flight brought priceless star power to Bezos’ space-tourism business, given its built-in appeal to baby boomers, celebrity watchers and space enthusiasts. Shatner starred in TV’s original “Star Trek” from 1966 to 1969, when the U.S. was racing for the moon, and went on to appear in a string of “Star Trek” movies.  Bezos is a huge “Star Trek” fan — the Amazon founder had a cameo as an alien in one of the later movies — and Shatner rode free as his invited guest.  As a favor to Bezos, Shatner took up into space some “Star Trek” tricorders and communicators — sort of the iPhones of the future — that Bezos made when he was a 9-year-old Trekkie. Bezos said his mother had saved them for 48 years.  Bezos himself drove the four crew members to the launch pad, accompanied them to the platform high above the ground and cranked the hatch shut after they climbed aboard the 60-foot rocket. He was there to greet them when the capsule floated back to Earth under its brilliant blue-and-red parachutes.  “Hello, astronauts. Welcome to Earth!” a jubilant Bezos said as he opened the hatch of the New Shepard capsule, named for first American in space, Alan Shepard.  Shatner and the others wore close-fitting, flame-retardant, royal-blue flight suits, not exactly the tight, futuristic-for-the-’60s V-necks that the crew of the Enterprise had on TV.  The actor said he was struck by the vulnerability of Earth and the relative sliver of its atmosphere.  “Everybody in the world needs to do this. Everybody in the world needs to see,” he said. “To see the blue color whip by, and now you’re staring into blackness, that’s the thing. The covering of blue, this sheath, this blanket, this comforter of blue that we have around, we say, ‘Oh, that’s blue sky.’ And then suddenly you shoot through it all, and you’re looking into blackness, into black ugliness.”  Shatner said the return to Earth was more jolting than his training led him to expect and made him wonder whether he was going to make it back alive.  “Everything is much more powerful,” he said. “Bang, this thing hits. That wasn’t anything like the simulator. ... Am I going to be able to survive the G-forces?”  Passengers are subjected to nearly 6 G’s, or six times the force of Earth’s gravity, as the capsule descends. Blue Origin said Shatner and the rest of the crew met all the medical and physical requirements, including the ability to hustle up and down several flights of steps at the launch tower.  Shatner going into space is “the most badass thing I think I’ve ever seen,” said Joseph Barra, a bartender who helped cater the launch week festivities. “William Shatner is setting the bar for what a 90-year-old man can do.”  The flight comes as the space tourism industry finally takes off, with passengers joyriding aboard ships built and operated by some of the richest men in the world.  Virgin Galactic’s Richard Branson went into space in his own rocket ship in July, followed by Bezos nine days later on Blue Origin’s first flight with a crew. Elon Musk’s SpaceX made its first private voyage in mid-September, though without Musk on board.  Last week, the Russians launched an actor and a film director to the International Space Station for a movie-making project.  Blue Origin said it plans one more passenger flight this year and several more in 2022. Sounding like the humane and idealistic Captain Kirk himself, the company said its goal is to “democratize space.”  Shatner strapped in alongside Audrey Powers, a Blue Origin vice president and former space station flight controller for NASA, and two paying customers: Chris Boshuizen, a former NASA engineer, and Glen de Vries of a 3D software company. Blue Origin would not divulge the cost of their tickets.  The flight brought to 597 the number of humans who have flown in space.  “Today’s launch is a testimony to the power of the imagination, and we should not lose sight of that power,” University of Rochester astrophysicist Adam Frank said in an email.  “William Shatner may be `just an actor,′ but Captain James T. Kirk represents a collective dream of a hopeful future in space that ‘Star Trek,’ and science fiction in general, gave us all,” Frank continued. “Bezos gave Shatner a seat on his rocket because he, like millions of others, fell in love with ‘Star Trek’ and its vision of a boundless frontier for humanity.”  ___  The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

But why not incorporate newly uncovered cultural treasures into the building, instead? That’s what McDonalds did when it found an ancient Roman road beneath an Italian construction project, reports Elisabetta Povoledo for The New York Times.  The newly opened result is the only McDonalds on Earth that includes an ancient Roman artifact. It all started in 2014, Povoledo reports, when workers in Marino came across a 147-foot-long stretch of road dating between the first and second centuries B.C.E. The road would otherwise have been documented and reburied, Povelodo notes. Instead, McDonalds sponsored an archaeological dig and used the road as part of the restaurant.  This isn't the first time, nor will it be the last that something like this has happened at a building site. Take 50 Bowery, a proposed hotel on New York’s Lower East Side, which as SmartNews reported in 2013, was delayed after builders found what appeared to be the remains of a tavern frequented by George Washington and others. The tavern was never positively identified, writes The New York Times’ Emily Rueb, but the site’s owners decided to incorporate some historical elements into the structure and build an exhibition space inside the hotel.  Now that this unique McDonalds has opened its doors, visitors can walk along transparent flooring and view the road or go underground to get a better look at three skeletons and other remnants, The Telegraph’s Nick Squires reports. The road is thought to have connected to the Appian Way, an ancient Roman superhighway that linked Rome to southern Italy.  While a Happy Meal with a side of history may seem quirky, the McDonald's location is far from the weirdest store in the fast food giant's repertoire. Indeed, McDonalds restaurants can be found in everything from airplanes to mansions. Not too far from Marino, there’s even a McDonalds decorated with Roman-style mosaics and marble fountains. In that sense, the new restaurant will fit right in.  (h/t mental_floss)",New McDonalds Has a Cool Design Element: an Ancient Roman Road,true

That comes despite the supporting companies making a combined $4.6 billion in financial commitments to the cause.  As Bloomberg reports:  A new study of diversity in the technology industry found companies that made statements of solidarity had 20% fewer Black employees on average than those that didn’t. The finding highlights a gap between what companies say about social issues and what they do in their own workplaces, said Stephanie Lampkin, the founder and chief executive officer of Blendoor, which conducted the study.  Obviously no company should be hiring specifically because one belongs to a particular demographic over skill, but it is amusing an amusing juxtaposition nonetheless.  Corporations pretending to take political stances for the purpose of promoting a public image of themselves is nothing new. We saw this when companies like Apple, Nike, and Coca-Cola all came out with their “principled stands against injustice” in opposing common sense voter integrity laws in George – as they were lobbying against a bill that would bar U.S. companies from relying on forced Uighur labor in China.  This is nothing new either. Decades ago, in response to businesses capitalizing off of climate change hysteria there was even a term coined to describe the practice of companies deceptively marketing themselves as “green” and “environmentally friendly” solely to boost business: greenwashing.

95,88256910189474760694260871425503562851,"Listen 0:00 BOSPUB-1.mp3  Earlier this month, 47 democrats in the house of representatives defied a house veto threat by backing a GOP bill to ramp up screening requirements for Syrian and Iraqi refugees. Congressman Stephen Lynch was among them. He joined Jim Braude and Margery Eagan on Boston Public Radio to discuss the reasoning behind his vote and other congressional matters.  Questions are paraphrased, and responses are edited where noted [...].  MARGERY: Let’s start with the vote on the Syrian refugees. Why were you with those 47 other democrats?  It’s a very simple bill, I know that it’s got subsumed within a larger discussion about immigration policy, but basically, the bill we voted on was a very short bill—four pages in length, basically, and it said that the director of national security shall review the vetting process as being conducted by both the FBI and the department of homeland security. Because of the disastrous results we’ve had so far with the screening process, especially the department of homeland security, I think it was a very good idea to have another set of eyeballs looking at that process.  Back in August, we did an investigation—the inspector General did—of the Department of Homeland Security, and they had 72 individuals that were on the terrorist watch list that were actually working at the Department of Homeland Security. The director had to resign because of that. Then we went further and did and eight-airport investigation. We had staffers go into eight different airports to test the department of homeland security screening process at major airports. They had a 95 percent failure rate. We had folks—this was a testing exercise, so we had folks going in there with guns on their ankles, and other weapons on their persons, and there was a 95 percent failure rate.  I have very low confidence based on empirical data that we’ve got on the Department of Homeland Security. I think we desperately need another set of eyeballs looking at the vetting process. That’s vetting that’s being done at major airports where we have a stationary person coming through a facility, and we’re failing 95 percent of the time. I have even lower confidence that they can conduct the vetting process in places like Jordan, or Belize or on the Syrian border, or in Cairo, or Beirut in any better fashion, especially given the huge volume of applicants we’ve had seeking refugee status.  JIM: Even if you’re right that the system needs strengthening, the most likely way that a terrorist would come into this country is not through an 18-24 month-long process, but through this Visa program that allows 20 million people from 38 countries to come here every single year with absolutely no prior approval at all.  We had Democratic and Republican proposals on this bill, and there wasn’t a dime’s worth of difference between the two of them. It became a sort of a proxy battle over immigration. You had a bunch of Republican governors who were using it politically, and saying, “we’re going to stop refugees from coming into our state, which is baloney because they have no ability—zero ability—under the constitution to actually prevent refugees from coming into their state. You also had other people on the far left saying that this would stop every person from coming into the United States. In both cases, if they only took the time to read the bill, they would see that it did not do either. The democratic proposal also requires a multi-layered vetting process of refugees.  The reason the refugee issue came up and not the Visa waiver program is because in the Paris example, you had somebody go into the stream of legitimate refugees and then perpetrate acts of violence upon the civilians in Paris. That’s why that example came to the forefront.  I agree with you—I think the Visa waiver program, where you’ve got 20 million people coming in, versus the [refugees] coming in, 10,000? perhaps? At the end of the day, obviously the Visa waiver program is the one that we should be looking at.  JIM: Governor Charlie Baker was one of those governors who hesitated about refugees coming to Massachusetts—he didn’t sign the letter that Republican governors sent to the president, but he did state that he wanted a pause on the whole refugee thing. Was he grandstanding in your opinion?  I don’t think he was. If you listen to his press conference, when he addressed it, I thought his remarks were very thoughtful, and I thought his remarks were very measured, compared to what you heard from some of the red state governors that were doing a lot of the chest bumping and that sort of thing. Governor Baker was asking for more information, which I think was totally appropriate.  MARGERY: You just mentioned the TSA’s terrible record. You mentioned having low confidence in the Department of Homeland Security… is it every man for himself every time you get in an airplane?  I think that they… The resources are being spent, I think there are a bunch of different weaknesses in our system, I think we have very low-paid TSA and DHS workers, I think there’s a huge turnover there, when you talk to the people at the airport who are actually working there. When Bush created this system, I think it was 700,000 employees, he basically stripped away their right to join a union. They’re trying to use low-wage employees there, I heard from a TSA employee last week who was leaving, and he said there’s just no room for advancement there, they’re just stuck. I think morale is part of it, and the whole screening process is being revisited now after the inspector general’s report.  MARGERY: If Homeland Security is so inept, but we depend on them, should we be much more scared than we are? Should the focus be to better train DHS employees?  Absolutely...we had a hearing three weeks ago where the new TSA director said that they’re going back to the drawing board, and beginning again in terms of what their approach is. That’s a good thing. It’s a little bit late in coming, but I think because of what happened in Paris and what happened in Egypt with the airliner, what happened in Beirut… We’re redoubling our efforts, but obviously the system that was initially put in place was inadequate.

Macdonald was taken off of the Weekend Update desk in 1998 at the behest of Don Ohlmeyer, president of NBC's West Coast division, allegedly because of ratings, although Macdonald believed that it was actually because he was ""insubordinate,"" especially when it came to jokes at the expense of people like of Michael Jackson and OJ Simpson. Macdonald ended up leaving the program later that season altogether.

Which Republican ever said that they did not like the American Rescue Plan because they wanted to defund the police? JEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Well, first, let me just note that the president ran and won the most votes of any candidate in history on a platform of boosting funding for law enforcement after Republicans spent decades trying to cut the COPS program — there’s record of that; that doesn’t require anyone having new comments — and then also stood in the way of crucial funding needed to prevent the laying off of police officers as crimes increased. That’s a simple statement of fact. REPORTER: I understand what you’re saying there; however, there are lots of examples of Democrats explicitly saying they want to defund the police. We’ve got Congresswoman Cori Bush, Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar. Are there any examples of Republican members of Congress saying they want to defund the police? PSAKI: I think most people would argue that actions are more important than words, wouldn’t you say? REPORTER: Well, to that point — to your point there: At the time of the vote on the American Rescue Plan, you had the Republican leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, he said he just didn’t like it because he thought it was a classic example of big-government Democratic overreach in the name of COVID relief. And then Kevin McCarthy said he thought Democrats were using coronavirus as an excuse to justify funding pet projects. Where is the — PSAKI: Well, here — REPORTER: “We’re going to vote against this because we want to defund the police”? PSAKI: Again, I think actions speak louder than words, Peter. So if you oppose funding for the COPS program — something that was dramatically cut by the prior administration, and many Republicans supported — and then you vote against a bill that has funding for the COPS program, we can let other people evaluate what that means.

99,136777197726369964590839264019021680241,"In an attempt to reduce violent crime, San Francisco, California, will launch a program that will pay people $300 a month if they don’t shoot someone.  Fox News reported that the program, called Dream Keeper Fellowship, “will pay 10 individuals who are at high risk of being on either end of a shooting $300 each month to not be involved in such crimes.” This means that people at high risk of being shot also qualify for the program, though it’s unclear how the determination is made. The program will launch in October.  Sheryl Davis, executive director of the Human Rights Commission, told Newsweek that the program is not “transactional,” as it may seem.  “It’s not necessarily as cut and dry as folks may think. It’s not as transactional as, ‘Here’s a few dollars so that you don’t do something bad,’ but it really is about how you help us improve public safety in the neighborhood,” she told the outlet.  From Newsweek:  Participants will be paired with life coaches from the city’s Street Violence Intervention Program and will be considered “community ambassadors” who work to prevent violence. They will work on their professional, personal, and community development and will be thought of as “partners” in engaging community members and decreasing violence.  Davis said the program will attempt to find the “root causes” of violence, which she said in “so many ways are economic.”  This sentiment was echoed by San Francisco Mayor London Breed.  “In many cases, sadly, the common denominator is that these folks do not have any sort of income. And so part of what we’re trying to do is make sure that money is not a barrier to turning your life around,” Breed said, according to The Telegraph.  Participants in the program can earn even more money by getting a job, going to school, or even mediating situations that may lead to violence. In other words, the program will pay people to do things they should be doing anyway. What happens if and when that money stops? Will the people continue to work or follow the law? Will they need to be paid this way forever?  Newsweek reported that the program in San Francisco is based on a similar one in Richmond, California, which the American Journal of Public Health said helped reduce gun homicide by 55%. That claim is so odd that even left-wing Mother Jones questioned whether paying people not to shoot others actually reduced crime or whether the city just got lucky.  The Washington Examiner’s David Freddoso noted that a similar program was also tried in Sacramento, “where its promoters boast that ‘only’ 44% of participants were subsequently arrested on new charges — well, as long as you don’t count about one-third of the participants who dropped out or were arrested in its first six months.”  Activist and Reverend Eugene Rivers, another critic of the program, told Fox News that the program was a “gimmick.”  “You do not get young people to turn from crime by generating gimmicks. This is a policy gimmick,” he said. “It’s a bad idea, it’s not a new idea and for many people it’ll be Christmas in September or October.”  The Daily Wire is one of America’s fastest-growing conservative media companies and counter-cultural outlets for news, opinion, and entertainment.

Darse E. Crandall announced on Tuesday that Mezvinsky, whose testimony helped convict Clinton, will indeed be prosecuted as a co-conspirator to Chelsea’s crimes.  A JAG source speaking under promise of anonymity told RRN that Rear Adm. Crandall revoked Mezvinsky’s immunity plea after learning that he had marginalized his role in Hillary and Chelsea’s child trafficking ring. At Clinton’s tribunal Mezvinsky had painted himself a victim, claiming the Clintons had made him an indentured servant in exchange for allowing Chelsea to be his bride. Mezvinsky testified under oath that the scope of his crime was destroying records linking the Clintons to the sale of underage boys and girls. He had told the Office of Military Commissions that his undying, amorous affection for Chelsea led him down a deep, dark path of self-regrets.  Although JAG and the OMC had not previously disclosed Mezvinsky’s fate, RRN heard through sources that Mezvinsky would be released from custody for having testified against Chelsea, presumably to care for his own children—odd since he helped destroy the lives of so many others.  On Tuesday, November 16, Rear Adm. Crandall said new evidence will clearly illustrate that Mezvinsky did far more than burn and shred and digitally cleanse evidence of the Clintons’ crimes. RRN has not been made aware of what that evidence might be, but it must be damning because Rear Adm. Crandall will ask the tribunal to consider capital punishment.  “The investigation into Clinton crimes didn’t end with Hillary’s death, not with Chelsea’s either. It’s been ongoing. There’s been an ongoing effort to identify kids whom the Clintons victimized—establishing their identities and getting testimony from ones that escaped fates worse than death. All I can say right now is Mezvinsky minimalized his involvement; the rest will come out at trial,” our source said.  Mezvinsky, he added, has been “detained” at Guantanamo Bay ever since his apprehension. Unlike other GITMO “guests,” Mezvinsky has avoided Camp Delta and instead been housed in barracks modernized to appear like a contemporary apartment.  “That will now change, now that he’s indicted and not a witness. On Monday he’ll be moved to Delta to await his tribunal, which will begin after Thanksgiving weekend. He’s been a wreck since Chelsea got hanged,” our source said.

She was 15 at the time of the encounter.  “My parents were political donors and got invites to events. That man…Hunter Biden was at one of them. I was with my parents and their friends when he came over to say hello. He gave off creepy vibes to me right away…I was about to excuse myself to grab a soda when Hunter said he’d get it for me. I started to say ‘no thank you,’ but he was already walking toward the bar…or whatever it was. As he handed me the drink, he brushed a finger over mine and it sent chills down my spine. I shouldn’t have drank the drink. I felt lightheaded and my legs felt rubbery. Everything went blurry. And next thing I know he is holding my hand, leading me up a staircase.”  Rear Adm. Crandall and the 3-officer panel sat in silent contemplation as Ashely relived the horrid event in her mind. Handcuffed and seated across from them, Hunter Biden glanced away from the screen on which Ashley, tears welling in her eyes, continued her story.  “It was like my parents had just vanished. My body literally went numb and my speech was slurred. Next I’m on a bed, and he’s looming over me undressing himself and then…me. Everything was fuzzy but it was him. And then he put a camera on a tripod and got into the bed with me…and raped me, vaginally and anally.”  Rear Adm. Crandall asked her if she saw the villain in the tribunal chamber. She pointed directly at Hunter Biden and said, “Him.”  He then set a laptop on the prosecution table and told the officers they would bare witness to Hunter Biden’s crimes shown on a grotesque video, although everything except Hunter and Ashely’s faces had been blurred. The video showed a naked Hunter Biden flopping around atop a top a young girl whose face was identical to Ashely’s. She seemed spaced out, crying “stop, stop, stop” as Biden repeatedly raped her.  “We obtained this video from one of Biden’s devices. Ashley, is this you in this video. I know it’s difficult to see,” Rear Adm. Crandall said.  “Yes,” she muttered.  Hunter Biden objected: “May I pose a question? Is this tribunal expected to believe I whisked this girl away, drugged her, and did these things—when she was accompanied by her parents? This video is fabricated, false.”  “When I came to and realized what had happened and told my parents, they called me a liar, too,” Ashley said. “They told me it never happened. That it must have been a nightmare. I no longer speak to them.”  Five more young women appeared on Zoom to tell eerily related stories, and the 3-officer panel had to suffer through video snippets of Hunter Biden’s assault on each of them. Biden made vain and ineffective attempts at refuting their testimony and the veracity of the videos, but the tribunal didn’t give any credibility to his rebuttals. The last girl to testify claimed that Hunter and his father raped her together, but the video only showed Hunter, not Joe.  Regardless, the tribunal reached a swift decision, finding Hunter Biden guilty on all charges and recommending he receive the death sentence for his crimes. Rear Adm.

104,90441816400320113167399611573580321697,"Delta Force operators on Saturday arrested Chelsea Clinton and husband Marc Mezvinsky while the two were travelling by car from Clinton’s lavish Manhattan condominium to a vacation spot in Rockport, MA., where the duo visits often to escape the hustle and bustle of city life, Real Raw News has learned. Per military sources, Special Forces had been shadowing Clinton for weeks, waiting for an opportunity to apprehend her when she was least protected.  That chance came shortly after 11:00 a.m. Saturday morning, about 20 miles northeast of Hartford, Connecticut, along Highway 84. Plain clothed Delta Force in two civilian vehicles stopped Clinton’s rented Mercedes GLE and saw three children in the rear seats. Although Clinton and Mezvinsky have 3 kids of their own—Charlotte, Jasper, and Aidan—the ones in the vehicle spoke no English and had a dark complexion; in short, they were not Clinton and Mezvinsky’s children, a source at the U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General’s Corps told Real Raw News.  He told RRN that JAG and the Office of Military Commissions have obtained evidence that Chelsea was following in her late mother’s footsteps—abducting Haitian children and selling them off to the highest bidders of a child trafficking ring that has existed for decades. The children found in her vehicle, our source said, were estimated to be between 8 and 12 years old, and spoke Haitian Creole.  Earlier this month a 7.2 magnitude earthquake rocked the island nation of Haiti, levelling buildings and killing at least 2,500 people, many of whom were adults whose children were left orphaned in the cataclysmic disaster.  The military alleges that Chelsea and her husband swept in, under the guise of a humanitarian mission sponsored by the Clinton Foundation and extracted Haitian kids under the pretense of rehoming them with stable, American families.  “We have evidence that Clinton pulled 50 kids out of Haiti. But there’s no proof the children were listed for foster care or put up for adoption. Her mother did this in the aftermath of the 2010 quake, and it certainly looks like the apple don’t fall far from the tree. Chelsea seems to have repeated her mother’s actions—and mistakes,” a JAG source told RRN.  He said a belligerent Chelsea Clinton chastised Delta Force operators, while her effeminate husband cowered in fear and sobbed about how he was only following his wife’s instructions. Delta Force took them into custody, and they have been moved to a holding facility at an unknown location.  Our source said he does not know the disposition of the minors.  “She was travelling without her Secret Service detail. We don’t know why, but we do know in the past they’ve slipped their detail,” our source said.  RRN will provide updates as they become available.

105,272551099392675324731306423016944451154,"On Thursday, July 1, a military tribunal at Guantanamo Bay convicted Chair of the House Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff on charges of treason and espionage after hearing evidence that linked the weaselly worm to a Chinese-sponsored plot aimed at impeaching the most patriotic president to have ever sat in the Oval Office.  In July 2019, Schiff grossly distorted and wildly mischaracterized Trump’s telephone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in which he is alleged to have withheld U.S. aid in return for an investigation into Hunter Biden. Both Trump and Zelenskiy refuted the allegations, but Schiff abused his authority in pressing Congress to move forward with an impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump.  In September 2019, the U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General’s Corps launched an investigation to determine whether Schiff’s actions violated House Rules, whether his grievances were constitutional.  JAG’s 6-month investigation proved that Schiff, like most Deep State operatives, had an unremitting addiction to opulence and happily accepted bribes in exchange for aiding enemies of the United States, when such actions aligned with his personal goals.  JAG and the Office of Military Commissions acquired evidence linking Schiff to a Chinese plot meant to depose Donald J. Trump. Specifically, Schiff had received “gifts” from a Chinese businessman named Li Wei. Wei was a senior executive at Bohai Harvest RST (Shanghai) Equity Investment Fund Management Co., the very company Hunter Biden owns 10% of.  The gifts included a rare 1954 Bao Dai Rolex valued at $5,000,000 and a Bugatti Chiron Pur Sport worth approximately $3,000,000, the later of which he surreptitiously auctioned at Sothebys.  The Office of Military Commissions claims Schiff blatantly violated the Gifts Rule of the House Ethics Committee, which forbids federal employees from accepting gifts for favors and requires that any item valued at over $166 be reported to the State Dept.  This evidence, in part, led to Schiff’s May 24 arrest and subsequent trip to Guantanamo Bay.  His Thursday tribunal lasted only two hours, with Vice Adm. John G. Hannink calling on the 3-officer panel to convict Schiff, who appeared without counsel, of high treason.  “Schiff’s greed, compounded by his seething hatred of Donald Trump, led him down a path of treasonous behavior. He is weak and malleable, and he did knowingly betray his oath of office in hopes of making money and staging a tacit coup against the elected President of the United States. Certainly, others must have known he received these gifts, and who they came from, but that was swept under the rug by a Deep State desperate to remove Trump from office. Schiff used aliases and proxies to launder many of his ill-gotten presents, but there’s always a trail,” Vice Adm. Hannink told the panel.  Asked to answer for his crimes, Schiff admitted he should have declined the gifts, but said they were “above board” and bore no relevance to his association with China, Li Wai, Joseph Biden, or Hunter Biden.  “Of course, I know these people,” Schiff said. “But Wai is a friend mine who struck good fortune and shared some of that with me, his friend. It had nothing to do with Trump. I have loyally served this nation for many years and don’t recognize this tribunal’s authority over me.”  Vice Adm. Hannink, as he had at previous tribunals, pulled the proverbial rabbit from a magic hat: via teleconference, Schiff’s wife Eve appeared on a video screen to testify against her husband. She told the tribunal that Schiff had accepted $20,000,000 in gifts and incentives to wage war against Donald Trump. She was able to produce receipts and ledgers, as well as personal correspondence between Schiff and Hunter Biden, proving Schiff’s payouts were meant as compensation for trying to dethrone Trump.  “The documents you see on screen, we have copies of,” Vice Adm. Hannink said, and passed the incriminating paperwork to the panel. “Mrs. Schiff, have you in anyway been coerced or compensated to give testimony against your husband?”  “I have not,” Eve Schiff said. “I was tired of the abuse. I’m glad this is finally over. I was tired of the lies, the manipulation, the evil that pervaded our home. Adam was never happy with a government salary. He was telling me how he hoped to get rid of Trump and get rich at the same time.”  “You’re getting what you deserve, Adam,” she addressed her husband personally, and the screen winked off.  Shortly thereafter, the three officers weighing the military’s case found Schiff guilty and recommended he receive capitol punishment for his crimes against America. Vice Adm. Hannink concurred, and scheduled Schiff’s execution for August 13.  (Visited 265,335 times, 6 visits today)",Adam Schiff Convicted of Treason,false

Scott is accused of instructing his followers to inject random spectators with fentanyl.  Houston Police took Scott into custody Monday night. One source close to the investigation confirmed with Conservative Beaver that Scott was found with child pornography on his computer, as well as documents regarding Satanism and the occult. Scott will face additional charges for the child pornography images.  Travis Scott’s lawyers did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The link between Scott and Satanic groups is still unclear, however the police source stated they are investigating other people and organizations that played a role in the murders.  According to USA Today, a criminal investigation was launched Sunday after “the crowd at a Houston music festival on Friday suddenly surged toward the stage during a performance by rapper Travis Scott, killing at least eight people.”  According to the Guardian: Travis Scott and Drake are being sued for having “incited mayhem” after eight people were killed and dozens injured in a crush during the AstroWorld concert.  Previous trouble with the law  According to the Associated Press, Travis Scott was previously arrested at least twice for prompting his audience to rush the stage in disobedience of security measures.  The media report said that, in 2017, the American rapper was accused of inciting followers to avoid security and hasten the stage at a concert in Arkansas. During the 2017 incident, more than a dozen people including a security guard and a police officer were injured in the incident. Some social media users also claimed that the singer had directed his fans to jump off the 3rd-floor balcony, which resulted in one concertgoer being pushed off from it. Similarly, in 2015, the American singer pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct charges after the Lollapalooza music festival in Chicago, reported news agency Sputnik. Scott reportedly called fans to climb over security barriers however, no injuries were reported at that time.  Reports of Satanic practices  Multiple viral tweets and TikTok videos have called attention to signs of Satanic rituals in Travis Scott’s performance, including flames and a circle onstage, which people claimed could be used for summoning demons.  Travis Scott is accused of being a Satanist. His show on Friday was described by many as a “demonic ritual.” TikTok commentator Conservative Barbie slammed Travis Scott in a video posted to her channel. The commentator claims the AstroWorld disaster was just a “tiny” glimpse of what hell would be like. She ends the video asking people to “stop worshipping celebrities.” Her video has received close to 50,000 likes at the time of publication.  Commentator Matt Walsh called Scott a “Satanic weirdo” that regularly encourages his crowds to “get out of control and violent.” Walsh added believes Scott deserves to be arrested and charged.  Matt Walsh on Twitter: “Travis Scott is a satanic weirdo who regularly encourages his crowds to get out of control and violent. He kept playing that night even as people were dying all around him.

110,176303560892511009234462993720602674020,"World  UPDATED 1:53 PM (SEE BOTTOM): EVIDENCE THAT LAPALMA ERUPTION & EARTHQUAKES ARE ARTIFICIAL ATTACK!  UPDATED 1:53 PM EDT - SEE BOTTOM -- The volcanic eruption which began on the Island of LaPalma in the Canary Islands, Atlantic Ocean, off the northwest coast of Africa seems to be getting some help: artificial help to make it WORSE! Evidence below:  When the Cumbre Viejo volcano on La Palma began erupting on September 10, it immediately became the focus of intense attention because that island is the only place in the world which can generate a Tsunami wave, which is capable of literally destroying the entire east coast of North America.  Back in the 1990's several scientists closely studied and even went inside the then-dormant volcano and found that the entire southwest flank had become unstable and could slide into the Atlantic Ocean. That unstable land mass is the size of the island of Manhattan, NYC, and would generate a tsunami wave.  Computer models showed the tsunami would begin hitting the US east coast within 7 to 8 hours, and would smash almost all the major cities, with a wall of water 30 meters to fifty meters high. That would mean a wave 100-164 FEET tall, lasting 5 to 45 minutes as it flooded 12-15 miles inland.  As interest in the eruption grew, people starting paying closer attention to what was taking place there.  Tonight, that attention has paid off.  The European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC) was founded in 1975, following a recommendation from the European Seismological Commission (ESC). The ESC is a regional commission of the International Association of Seismology and Physics of the Earth's Interior (IASPEI), itself a specialized association of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG). Put simply, it is Europe's equivalent to the US Geological Survey in the USA.  Tonight, if someone goes to the EMSC web site to look at earthquakes taking place on the island of LaPalma, they get a map showing this:  The red dots forming a blob of red indicates the ongoing clusters of earthquakes around the erupting volcano.  If you zoom-in a little closer on the same earthquake map, you see this:  But watch what happens when you zoom-in really close:  That's almost a perfect grid pattern. There is no way that's natural. No possible way at all.  Hal Turner Editorial Opinion  It looks as though LaPalma is being attacked. It appears some type of technology is being used to specifically target the island and CAUSE earthquakes, and the attack pattern indicates it is intended to deliberately weaken the same southwest flank where the unstable land mass is located.  THERE ARE EVEN PRECISE SECONDARY EARTHQUAKES IN THE PRECISE LOCATION OF EARLIER EARTHQUAKES!  This appears to be a deliberate effort to CAUSE the flank to slide into the ocean and generate a tsunami to wipe out the US east coast.  Whoever is doing this appears to be TRYING to cause the destruction of the US east coast. This may be an actual act of war!  Unless, of course, it's the US Government doing it, to cause a calamity which wipes out a slew of people who would no longer be able to claim welfare, Medicare or Medicaid? Think of how many people on the east coast, who have paid into Social Security for years, wouldn't be alive to claim any benefits! Big savings for the US government!  Even more enticing for some of the government control freaks, it would be the perfect excuse to implement nationwide Martial Law when all the big bank headquarters got demolished, and the business capital of the country was destroyed, allowing the government to justify their takeover of . . . everything.  Or how about this: The tsunami happens, it kills the estimated 65 million that FEMA thinks could die in such a cataclysm, so the government goes to the bankers and says, the country is wrecked, we have no hope at all of paying our $28 TRILLION national debt; we need debt forgiveness . . . . and they get the slate wiped clean so they can start the whole shebang all over again!  Whatever is going on on La Palma, may have begun naturally, but as of 11:45 PM eastern US time on Friday, October 22, 2021, it now clearly looks as though some type of man-made attack is taking place.  It LOOKS like somebody wants a lot of Americans dead.  Here is a DIRECT LINK to the EMSC Earthquake map. You can verify these findings yourself by going to LaPalma, then zooming in.

The special broadcast features Dr. Douglas Frank who holds a Ph.D in Surface Analytical Chemistry for the University of Cincinnati. Dr. Frank is an internationally recognized scientist with over fifty scientific publications. In 1990 Dr. Frank discovered and invented a technique for creating three dimensional images of molecules resting on surfaces. This led to a cover article in Science Magazine, which is the most read science magazine in the world by scientists, and he was on the cover of the Naturwissenschaften, in Europe.  Dr. Frank has spent countless hours since the 2020 election following the data of the election returns county by county across such states as Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Colorado to name a few. Dr. Frank’s scientific and mathematical investigation has revealed that there was absolutely massive cyber fraud in the 2020 election.  In the television special Dr. Frank testifies to host Mike Lindell that deviations and mathematical impossibilities could not have been done by humans, by artificial intelligence and computers that were running before, during, and after the 2020 U.S. election.  Dr. Frank’s investigation reveals that the 2010 national census data was used to manipulate the 2020 election rolls and to inject phantom votes into the election totals. His scientific investigation documented and proved that numerous states throughout America had more people voting than lived in many of the counties.  The injection of the 2010 national census data into the 2020 election rolls facilitated a crime that some experts are calling the largest cyber-crime in world history.  Dr. Frank explains that the 2010 census was used to actually cast votes for voters that had either passed away or no longer lived in the county or state.  In numerous documented cases, voters showed up to vote at their precinct only to be told they had already voted, when in fact, they had not voted. What is now being revealed by the scientific investigation of Dr. Frank is that these Americans had their vote cast for them through a highly sophisticated computer program.  In this television special, Dr. Frank explains to Mike Lindell what tipped him off that a cyber-crime had been committed — not in just a few precincts, counties or swing states, but on a national basis. Dr. Frank also reveals that even in the states President Trump won, the President won those states by larger numbers than was reported.

The FBI is reportedly making arrangements to fly in and interrogate him once Interpol is done with him.  Giuseppe Governale, Italy’s chief anti-mafia prosecutor, was called in early into the investigation into Pope Francis and others within the Vatican. He said the group was “underestimated” and particularly dangerous because of its ability to proliferate across nations and infiltrate them.  “These individuals are truly the worst of the worst in society. I can promise you, we will not stop targeting human trafficking until we put a stop to this despicable trade in the Vatican and Italy, as well as surrounding countries around Europe. While I am a lead prosecutor in Italy, my department will strive to protect our citizens, especially those that need us most, our children”. Giuseppe Governale  In order to make the arrest, police and military agents had to cut off the power in the Vatican, as well as dim the live cam. This was noticed by web-sleuths, who quickly became suspicious of what was happening in the Vatican.

115,168630167933794745497863382647998652761,"Nation  U.S. STATE GOVERNORS NAMES ON CHINA COMMUNIST PARTY **MEMBERSHIP** LIST  A database obtained by computer hackers from China Communist Party computers allegedly reveals the names of more than a DOZEN U.S. State Governors who are reportedly shown in the database as being MEMBERS of China's Communist Party:  The database was originally leaked on Telegram, the encrypted instant messaging app, and passed in September by a Chinese dissident to the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, which comprises more than 150 legislators around the world who are concerned by the influence and activities of the Chinese government. Here is a statement from IPAC about the data:  Detailed analysis by U.S. Intelligence sources say the list is genuine!  The list mostly includes the details of CCP members based in Shanghai, in more than 79,000 branches, or cells. The CCP's total membership currently stands at more than 92 million, with a success rate of around 10 percent for aspiring members.  China Communist Party (CCP) members have infiltrated not only some of the largest corporations of the US, Australia and the UK, but also many consulates and government agencies, giving them access to sensitive and no doubt compromising information that would give the CCP an edge on the world stage.  Make no mistake, these agents ultimately answer directly to the party and Chairman Xi Jinping.  This is a fascinating look inside the CCP’s infiltration network and gives us an idea of just how deeply their agents have been embedded.  The original database in Chinese contains some 1.95 million names, the majority from Shanghai, many complete with National ID number & personal details, but also contains the details of some 79,000 communist party branches, many of them INSIDE the companies they have infiltrated. Some of the names are listed as having been “executed” while others have notes regarding organs and a price.  Take a quick look at how the CCP works:  Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger who ran what may be the most fraudulent election in the nation on November 3, where President Trump lost the traditionally Red State, has a brother. Meet Brother, Ron Raffensperger CTO for HUAWEI Enterprise Storage Solutions, the Data Storage Company of . . . . the CCP.  The same Chinese Communist Party (CCP) that paid DOMINION $400 million through a subsidiary of HSBC, a month or so BEFORE the November 3 election, which may have gotten the CCP the ability to ""update"" Dominion voting software for the then-upcoming U.S. Presidential Election!  Elsewhere, other key people are tunring out to have strong connections to the CCP. Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson – currently obstructing efforts to investigate Michigan’s election results – developed ties with Chinese state-run universities and trained lawyers for the Chinese Communist Party – even delivering a lecture at Chinese Premier Xi Jinping’s alma mater.    Benson undertook the work aiding the Chinese Communist Party while serving as the Dean of Wayne Law School in Detroit, Michigan.  Being the CTO for a mega corporation like HUAWEI pays huge bucks. Maybe some of that money is going to a certain Secretary of State? Who knows what's happening between the two brothers . . . maybe at the behest of the CCP?  China's infiltration efforts have been vast. Major aerospace companies Airbus, Rolls-Royce, and Boeing have employed hundreds of CCP members. Additionally, Pfizer and British drugmaker AstraZeneca (COVID-19 Vaccine developer!) employed a total of 123 Party members. British automaker Jaguar Land Rover also employed CCP members.  Now, back to the USA. The Governors allegedly named in the database are listed below:    AZ - Ducey    AR - Hutchinson    CA - Newsome    CT - Lamont    NM - Grisham    VT - Scott    IA - Reynolds    RI - Raimondo    NE - Ricketts    DE - Carney    IN - Holcomb    NV - Sisolak    TN - Lee    KY - Beshear    ID - Little    MT - Bullock    OR - Brown    IL - Pritzker    LA - Edwards    TX - Abbott    MN - Waltz    MA- Baker  NC-Cooper    UT - Herbert  Other names totaling 1.9 Million people, are also on the list, which is still being sorted and translated. The process of translating is taking longer than expected, but it looks like this: (Click image to enlarge)  POMPEO WARNED THEM ALL  Earlier this year, U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, spoke at the National Governor's Association Winter Meeting and HE WARNED GOVERNORS they were being targeted by China. He told the Governors that China was doing harm to the US and to our industries, and they were moving to manipulate Governors into doing things that would help China AT THE EXPENSE of America. Pompeo warned them all to be careful.  The warning apparently came too late because based on the information outlined above, obtained from computer hackers, it SEEMS that several U.S. State Governors may have already sold-out and become Communists.  COMMUNISM ILLEGAL IN THE UNITED STATES  The Communist Party is unlawful in the United States. It's very existence is banned by federal law. Here is the law:  Of course, while the federal law above bans the Communist Party of the United States, it does NOT ban the Communist Party of China. The question then becomes, have these Governors become members of the China Communist Party (CCP) for the SAME PURPOSE as that previously espoused by the Communist Party of the United States? Same political ideology . . . same goal?  Folks who live in states whose Governor's name appears on the CCP Member List, need to make a major fuss about this and find out what's what.

117,128673969544887014112874722250225160398,"Florida Governor Ron DeSantis on Wednesday did not mince words on a congested conference call with Biden and federal health authorities who are seeking to prohibit domestic travel to and from the Sunshine State. DeSantis and Biden exchanged salvos of biting barbs after the criminal president said the federal government had authority to “restrict movement” of the people.  Citing concerns over the widespread proliferation of Covid-19 variants, Biden said he might have to prohibit vehicle and air traffic until the CDC and NIH were confident that currently available vaccinations had a proven efficacy against emerging strains, such as highly transmissible anomalies from the United Kingdom, Brazil, and South Africa.  Also on the call were “Deep State” Dr. Fauci and acting CDC Director Rochelle Walensky, both of whom championed Biden’s idea and told DeSantis that surging cases in Florida threatened to undermine the federal government’s expansive efforts to mitigate spread across the country. Florida, Dr. Fauci said, was the epicenter of Covid-19 mutations, and argued that new variants accounted for between 15-35% of new cases in Florida.  Walensky argued on the call that any attempt by DeSantis to resist a federally mandated travel ban would be immoral, selfish, and possibly illegal.  Biden echoed her words, and he berated DeSantis for having left Florida’s economy open during “the dark days of Covid.” Moreover, Biden claimed he had unilateral and constitutional authority to protect the nation’s health from “rogue politicians” acting in contravention of established health guidelines.  DeSantis’s initial reply was brief and blunt: “I will not comply,” he said, and then cited the CDC’s own statistics showing a nationwide decline in active Covid-19 cases.  Florida had arrested the spread of Covid-19, DeSantis argued, and accused Biden of targeting Republican states that supported Donald Trump.  “Florida absolutely will not comply,” DeSantis repeated. “Instituting a travel ban or restriction of movement would be a gross example of federal overreach with no grounding in law or science. We have Covid-19 in check, and you’re trying to exert unlawful authority over our state and its people,” he chided Biden.  Biden then tacitly threatened to withhold federal funding and to deny Florida access to Covid-19 vaccinations.  “C’mon, man, Florida needs our help, and you need vaccines, which are hard to come by, isn’t that right, Dr. Fauci,” Biden said.  The “Deep State” doctor replied in the affirmative, telling DeSantis that he expects the prevalence of the UK variant to double or triple every week to 10 days.  “Governor, do you want to be responsible for reinfecting the nation? Truth is, we don’t even know how effective current vaccines are against the UK strain.”  DeSantis told Dr. Fauci he trusted his own state health authorities over financially incentivized federal officials.  “How much do you stand to earn from these vaccines, Dr. Fauci? And, Joe, if you continue with this course of action, I will authorize the state National Guard to protect the movement of Floridians,” DeSantis said.  “Address me as Mr. President or President Biden,” Biden said.  “I will not, and you can go fuck yourself,” DeSantis said before hanging up.  In closing, it seems obvious that Team Biden favors perpetual lockdowns and a stagnant economy, keeping Americans imprisoned under a de facto state of medical martial law.

119,160429690561290892893444429613585961776,"OPINION:  The Biden administration has justified its new COVID-19 vaccination mandate as an “emergency power.”  But just where is the emergency?  If we’re facing such grave danger from the COVID-19 pandemic, then why did it take the Biden administration two months to draft its OSHA ruling on private businesses that employ more than 100 people? If there’s such a medical emergency, why did the Biden administration delay its mandate implementation date nearly a month from Dec. 8 to Jan. 4, conveniently after the holidays to minimize workforce disruptions?  The fact of the matter is COVID-19 case rates have been declining precipitously nationwide. The number of new daily COVID-19 cases has dropped 57% nationally since peaking on Sept. 1, as more people get vaccinated or recover and enjoy natural immunity. Some 67.7% of the American population has received at least one dose of the vaccine, and 58.5% have been fully vaccinated. Nearly 86% of adults over the age of 65 have been fully vaccinated – hitting Dr. Anthony Fauci’s “75 to 80-plus%” target on reaching herd immunity.  Not surprisingly, Dr. Fauci has been quietly raising his estimates throughout the past year, telling The New York Times in September a 70% to 90% range is more likely. Still, the World Health Organization cites a 60% to 70% range as the goal for achieving herd immunity.  COVID-19 death rates are also declining nationwide and hospitals are no longer overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients.  “In another month to two months, I think we’ll be on the back end of this, and prevalence will be very low, and you’ll start to see local communities lift restrictions. Some are already lifting them,” former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb predicted this week on CBS’ “Face the Nation.” “I think that we’re close to the end of the pandemic phase of this virus.”  In addition to vaccines being widely available, both Pfizer and Merck have developed oral pills awaiting federal authorization that can treat COVID-19 cases at home, cutting both hospitalization and fatality rates. The drug Ivermectin has been used successfully on some patients when prescribed by a doctor, as has hydroxychloroquine. Both are FDA-approved inexpensive generic drugs that have been used for decades to treat other ailments.  For young, healthy adults, there’s a 99.9% chance they’ll survive the disease if they come down with COVID-19, and on average, 98.2% of known COVID-19 patients in the U.S. survive. Coupled with high voluntary vaccination rates, these odds certainly don’t seem like they constitute a medical “emergency.”  Clearly, the Biden administration’s desire is to prolong the COVID-19 pandemic for as long as possible. Why? So they can exert greater state control over the American population with their “emergency rulings.” From a public policy perspective, however, this approach is coming at great cost. Twenty-seven states have filed lawsuits against Mr. Biden’s vaccination mandate and on Friday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit ordered a stay on its implementation.  Thousands of front-line workers have lost their jobs for refusing to get a jab, and airlines have had to cancel flights because of vaccination mandates.  COVID-19 fears have crippled our supply chain and sparked a labor shortage. Imposing a vaccination mandate on private businesses will only exacerbate these crises. Even the Biden team seems to know it, which is why they pushed back the implementation deadline until after the holidays.  “The people that operate the pickup and delivery systems, the warehouses and the fulfillment and sortation centers that make this country’s logistics system go, there’s a fair number of them, a large percentage, that simply do not want to be vaccinated,” Fred Smith, the CEO of FedEx, explained on Sunday to CBS “Face the Nation. “That’s not just hearsay. I was in a couple of our facilities just two days ago and had that confirmed by a number of our front-line managers. And it’s what we’re hearing throughout our system. So, this was a wise decision to move the mandate.”  Mr. Biden didn’t want to ruin Christmas with his federal overreach, hence the delay. It’s politics, pure and simple. If we were actually in an “emergency,” as the administration claims, it would be easy for the president to explain to the American people why Christmas should be canceled this year. But he can’t because we’re not. And everybody knows it. Everybody except Mr. Biden.  The pandemic is over, but the Biden administration will never admit it. Our leaders will keep moving the COVID-19 goalposts to preserve their position and power. It’s up to the American people to resist and for the courts to stop them.  • Kelly Sadler is the commentary editor at the Washington Times.

120,167282208584189593961208697574617768921,"A new report from Italy’s Higher Institute of Health provides an objective analysis of the nation’s misleading covid-19 death tally. Italy’s official covid death tally rose to 132,161 in October of 2021. This tally is unrealistic because covid-19 was diagnosed in haste and under conditions of financial bribery using non-specific diagnostic criteria.  Covid-19 was often listed as the cause of death when it was merely “suspected” and when “it could not be ruled out.”  After careful review of the medical reports, it turns out that respiratory infections may have been a contributing factor but did not cause most of these covid-19 deaths outright.  Various forms of medical malpractice, withheld treatment, inhumane isolation, undernourishment, and unethical standards of care are at the root of this worldwide medical crisis. The deaths are real, but the causes are skewed.  New medical analysis reduces Italy’s covid-19 death tally by 97.1%  A new analysis reduced Italy’s covid-19 death tally by 97.1 percent and provided a more accurate picture as to why these people died in the hospital. Only 3,783 cases could be directly correlated with a covid-19 diagnosis. Because the PCR test (that was designed to detect covid-19) was fraudulently-calibrated from the start, even these 3,783 cases of covid-19 are suspect.  Symptoms of respiratory infection could have been the result of any number of infections that kill people every year, whether that be influenza, tuberculosis, pneumonia or countless other lower and upper respiratory tract infections. Viral infections do not have the same effect on one person to the next due to several underlying factors including the cellular and microbiome terrain, so it is extremely difficult to accurately diagnose a specific respiratory infection and quantify viral load.  According to this new analysis, only 2.9% of the deaths registered since the end of February 2020 have been caused by the novel SARS coronavirus that has never been isolated from humans and replicated in human tissue samples. The annual respiratory infections, antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections, medical errors and other acute medical emergencies that usually cause overcrowding in hospitals were used as propaganda to terrorize and defraud the world into perpetual lock down.  The covid-19 death tally included Italians who suffered from one to five underlying chronic diseases; many were on immune suppressant drugs, and a certain percentage died from medical emergencies that are totally unrelated to covid-19. A total of 67.7% suffered from more than three chronic diseases that had not been resolved through modern medicine. Italians who were already suffering from chronic conditions went on to suffer further from ventilator-associated pneumonia and ventilator-associated lung damage.  One in ten of the deceased patients had a stroke; 65.8% of the Italians had arterial hypertension and were on immune-suppressant drugs; 15.7% suffered from heart failure; 28% had ischemic heart disease; and 24.8% suffered from atrial fibrillation. At least 17.4% already had sick lungs. Many (29.3% had diabetes and other metabolic ailments) that drastically impacted their immune response.  There were several patients (16.3%) who were on their deathbed, struggling on immunosuppressant chemotherapy and radiation drugs known to make people susceptible to any respiratory infection.  These cancer patients had been dealing with cancer for the past five years, with an average three-to-five-year chemotherapy survival rate coming to a close. Another 23.5% were struggling with dementia, their life coming to a close.  Unethical, inhumane practices have been implemented in medical systems worldwide  Ever since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a worldwide pandemic of SARS-CoV-2, medical systems around the world have handled hospitalized patients differently. Patients with any sort of respiratory symptom were isolated and separated from family members.  “Out of an abundance of caution,” hospital systems made vague diagnoses, classifying anyone “suspected of covid” as an official case of SARS-CoV-2. These patients were viewed as highly contagious vectors of disease that should be isolated and put on mechanical ventilation.  Efficacious treatments were bypassed. People dying on ventilators were classified as covid deaths “when covid-19 could not be ruled out as the primary cause of their death.”  As terror and fear were propagated across the media, hospital systems put non-urgent, elective procedures on hold, suspending routine outpatient services that left many chronic patients without adequate medical care.  Industrialized nations like Italy did not implement at-home treatment plans and did not distribute nutraceuticals and prophylactics to help control respiratory disease in the population. This caused populations to be dependent on an already overcrowded system that is not set up to deal with panic, ignorance and helplessness.  As nations continue to put all their stock in retrovirus-contaminated influenza jjabs and experimental gene interference coronavirus jjabs, people continue to suffer and die, even as countless anti-viral, bronco-dilating, anti-inflammatory immune therapies exist.

121,153413353294637456778770852368236678845,"Failed California Governor Gavin Newsom got a rude awakening, literally, when he first opened his eyes Monday morning following a 11-day-long vaccine-induced coma that he fell into shortly after receiving a Covid-19 booster shot. The first thing Newsom saw through eyes opened to narrow slits were a Navy physician removing an intubation tube from his mouth and Rear Adm. Crandall looming over the hospital bed on which he lay.  Newsom tried to cough, but he hadn’t the strength. Frail and gaunt, the ever-thin Newsom had lost so much weight, he looked more inhuman than human. He winced as if in pain as the physician waved a penlight before his eyes.  “We’re delighted you’re still with us,” Rear Adm. Crandall told him, according to a GITMO source familiar with the incident.  “What the?” Newsom gurgled. “I’m in hell. My wife, my kids.  “They’re fine, which is more than can be said about you. Looks like that vaccine you push so hard didn’t work too well for you,” Rear Adm. Crandall reportedly said.  Newsom’s breath came slow and shallow. He choked on his words, struggling to speak. “Placebo. I was supposed to get a placebo.”  “You Deep Staters are always double-crossing one another,” Rear Adm. Crandall said. “When medically fit, you will be put on trial, held accountable for thousands of fatalities. Enjoy this reprieve while you can.”  JAG and the Office of Military Commissions will seek the death penalty, our source said. Although he was unable to provide to RRN a complete list of charges, he said that JAG will hold Newsom to account for the deaths of “thousands” of senior citizens and 600 California children who had developed lethal staph infections from prolonged mask usage, as well as 4,000 vaccine-related fatalities that he had obfuscated by ordering the California Department of Public Health to blame the deaths on other causes, like heart attacks, diabetic shock, aneurisms, etc.  JAG, our source added, has already subpoenaed witnesses to testify against Newsom, including members of his staff, employees of CDPH, and friends and family privy to his wanton corruption. Several potential witnesses expressed joy at the idea of seeing Newsom hang, while others had to be finagled—comply or be charged as an accomplice.  Lesser charges, which JAG might not pursue at trial, include Newsom’s “pay-for-pandemic” scheme, in which he accepted $30m in “campaign contributions” from the CEOs of Netflix, Hulu, and other streaming services in exchange for keeping movie theaters and entertainment centers shut down during the plandemic. The endgame was to boost sales for struggling streaming services and, in turn, bankrupt the theater industry.  “There’s enough evidence on Newsom as there was on Cuomo, if not more. His fate is pretty much sealed. I imagine right now he’s wishing that vaccine actually killed him,” our source said.

The decision to hang Clinton, a JAG source told Real Raw News, was not reached swiftly because Rear Adm. Crandall was initially uncertain whether legal precedence supported the execution of a criminal not convicted of murder or treason. Although the 3-officer panel recommended capitol punishment, Rear Adm. Crandall sought council instead of making a unilateral judgment.  On October 28, two days after Clinton’s conviction, Rear Adm. Crandall tasked 6 senior JAG officers with deciding whether Clinton should be hanged or spend life at Guantanamo Bay. Until that point, all executions took place after a military tribunal found the accused guilty of murder and/or treason, clearly defined capitol offenses worthy of a hanging or firing squad. Trafficking in foreign children, as opposed to American ones, “muddied the waters,” Rear Adm. Crandall said, but also admitted that the severity of Clinton’s crimes paralleled her mother’s.  For nine days JAG’s brightest legal minds pondered Clinton’s fate, ultimately concluding that Chelsea Clinton would indeed be hanged. “Chelsea Clinton’s crimes, on which she has been convicted, and wanton disregard for child safety and welfare leave us no choice but to support a death penalty. Her lack of remorse at her tribunal leads us to believe that lifelong imprisonment will not benefit her,” they wrote in a memorandum.  Upon learning her fate, Clinton collapsed in a tearful fit.  “You can’t hang me, I’m a mother, what about my children. They’ll be left motherless,” Clinton said to Rear Adm. Crandall.  “I guess you should have thought of that before you ruined the lives of thousands of mothers and children,” Rear Adm. Crandall snapped.  “Why don’t you hang Marc instead? Why aren’t you hanging him?” Clinton asked.  “He cooperated with us,” Rear Adm. Crandall replied.  “I’m so, so sorry. It was my mother and Bill. They forced me—” Clinton started, but Rear Adm. Crandall interrupted her.  “–You’re not very adroit at faking emotion. You hang tomorrow.”  And on the morning of November 6, Chelsea Clinton’s neck snapped, ending over 30 years of Clinton carnage.  RRN did not feel it necessary to spell out the details of the actual hanging as they were remarkably like those of other Deep State agents whose lives ended at the gallows.

Vaccine formulation  Authorization is being requested for a modified formulation of the Pfizer‑BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Each dose of this formulation contains 10 μg of a nucleoside-modified messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding the viral spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 that is formulated in lipid particles and supplied as a frozen suspension in multiple dose vials. To provide a vaccine with an improved stability profile, the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine for use in children 5-11 years of age uses tromethamine (Tris) buffer instead of the phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) as used in the previous formulation and excludes sodium chloride and potassium chloride. The packaged vials for the new formulation are stored frozen at -90°C to – 60°C. The frozen vials may be thawed and stored at refrigerator at 2°C to 8°C for up to 10  weeks.  For more real news, see our home page, PressCalifornia.com.  Tromethamine (Tris) is a blood acid reducer which is used to stabilize people with heart attacks.

125,234242797683800776876719382265426554314,"Pilots of Southwest Airlines and other major U.S. carriers have good reason for resisting vaccination mandates. Their fellow pilots who had taken the controversial Covid-19 vaccine have been dropping dead on both domestic and international flights.  Two weeks ago, Dr. Jane Ruby claimed on the Stew Peters Show that a Delta Airlines pilot died inflight, shortly after the pilot had received a second dose of the Covid-19 vaccination. The mainstream media, Delta, and the so-called fact-checking agencies quickly dismissed the claim, calling it false and unsubstantiated—mainly because the claimant did not supply the name of the pilot, the flight number, or the points of origin and destination for the flight.  Nonetheless, Real Raw News felt the issue deserved further investigation. Although we cannot authenticate Dr. Ruby’s specific incident, we learned that at least two freshly vaccinated pilots had dropped dead midflight within weeks of having received a Covid-19 vaccination.  An FAA whistleblower speaking under condition of anonymity told RRN that the Biden administration, the FAA, and the airlines are covering up the incidents because the airlines need ticket sales and because the administration wants to maintain the illusion that Covid-19 vaccines are safe and effective.  According to him, two American Airline pilots in 14 days have perished in the cockpit.  On October 15, American Airlines Flight 2740, an Airbus A320, was enroute from Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport to Fort Meyers (RSW) when the unthinkable happened. As the plane began a gradual decent toward southwest Florida, the pilot in command (PIC) began convulsing and had a cardiac arrest. Fortunately, the aircraft was still on autopilot, giving the co-pilot time to evaluate the situation, unharness himself, pull the PIC from his seat and try to administer CPR. But his efforts were in vain.  The co-pilot returned to his seat and squawked 7700, the international transponder code for “I have an emergency.” The plane landed safely, but the co-pilot was put on administrative leave for having left his seat and endangering the aircraft, our source said.  “It was later determined that the PIC had a fatal heart attack caused by myocarditis, a known side effect of the Covid-19 vaccinations. He had received his second dose of the vaccine two weeks before that flight. His last full physical was three months prior, and his doctor had given him a clean bill of health,” our source said.  The second fatality took place a week later, and it, too was a DFW departure. American Airlines Flight 971, an Airbus A321, departed DFW for LAX at 8:00 a.m. Midway through the flight, the co-pilot complained he had chest pains but chalked it up to having eaten a spicy meal before departure. He told the PIC it was indigestion. As the plane flew at 32,000 ft. over the New Mexico/Arizona state line, the co-pilot started convulsing and vomiting on the flight controls. At that point, the PIC contacted Air Traffic Control, requesting permission to swing around and make an emergency landing in Albuquerque, NM, but ATC, after apparently consulting American Airlines, denied the request and compelled the PIC to complete the flight to LAX.  The co-pilot died in his chair, also from acute myocarditis. He had gotten his second vaccination—Pfizer—21 days ahead of that fateful flight.  “The PIC was put under a gag order and told not to discuss the incident with anyone under threat of losing his job,” our source said. “There is a systematic effort going on right now to prevent the public from knowing about pilots getting very ill or very dead in the air. The airlines don’t want to lose money, and the administration doesn’t want the public to know the true dangers of the vaccine. I know for fact that Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg ordered the airlines to classify incidents involving pilot deaths.”  In closing, he added that he is aware of at least 12 non-fatal incidents involving pilots that had recently taken the jab.

The ‘Covid-19 Vaccine Surveillance Report – Week 43’ was published by the UK Health Security Agency (formerly Public Health England) on Thursday, 28th October 2021 and it shows that the vast majority of Covid-19 hospitalisations between September 27th and October 24th were among the fully vaccinated population.  Table 3 of the report shows that the number of people presenting to emergency care with Covid-19 resulting in overnight inpatient admission who were not-vaccinated was 2,832, whilst a further 305 were partly vaccinated, and 5.124 were fully vaccinated.  Meaning between September 27th and October 24th, 66% of those hospitalised with Covid-19 were vaccinated whilst 34% were not-vaccinated.  However, the above figures unfortunately are not reflected in the number of Covid-19 deaths, because whilst the majority were yet again among the fully vaccinated, the difference between the vaccinated and not-vaccinated was much greater.  Table 4 of the report shows the number of people to have died within 28 days of a positive test result for Covid-19 who were not vaccinated was just 487, whilst a further 88 were partly vaccinated, but a shocking 2,185 were fully vaccinated.  Meaning between September 27th and October 24th, 82.4% of those who died with Covid-19 were vaccinated whilst just 17.6% were not vaccinated.

127,160041499387201398371320513885789589546,"Marc Mezvinsky’s testimony resumed Thursday morning, and his remarks helped slam shut Chelsea Clinton’s proverbial coffin.  Rear Adm. Crandall opened the day by asking Mezvinsky about the 3 Haitian children who were passengers in Chelsea’s rented Mercedes at the time of her arrest.  “They were imported into the country some time ago; I don’t remember exactly when. They were meant to be gifts to a friend of the Clinton foundation,” Mezvinsky said.  “Interesting vernacular you have there. You use the word ‘imported’ as if they were a crate of microchips or lettuce. I think the words ‘abducted’ and ‘smuggled’ are more appropriate, don’t you? Who was this friend?” Rear Adm. Crandall asked.  Mezvinsky said he did not know. He claimed that he was to wait in the vehicle while Chelsea escorted the children to a hotel room in Rockport, Massachusetts. He also denied knowledge of the youngsters’ names, for Chelsea, like her mother, indecipherably scrambled proper names into anagrams to thwart attempts to track down smuggled children.  “Was it common for you and the defendant to personally deliver smuggled kids into the hands of pedophiles? You’re both high-profile people. Isn’t that a bit…risky and stupid?”  “It was rare, and she told me it was a special delivery. Besides, we had a get out of jail free card, like in the monopoly game,” Mezvinsky said.  “Get out of jail free card? Could you expand on that?” asked Rear Adm. Crandall.  “Say, for example, we got puled over by a state trooper, or even the feds, for whatever reason. They’d make one phone call and be told they’d have to release us, no questions asked,” Mezvinsky said.  “Are you suggesting, Mr. Mezvinsky, that local law enforcement and the intelligence agencies are subservient to the Clintons?” Rear Adm. Crandall asked.  “Absolutely,” Mezvinsky replied.  “It seems the Delta Force operators who arrested you didn’t honor that get out of jail free card you had,” Rear Adm. Crandall said.  “That was—unexpected,” Mezvinsky admitted.  Rear Adm. Crandall wanted to know if Hillary Chelsea Clinton knew the names of the thousands of children she and her family had sold to pedophiles, and the identities of the recipients.  “She does,” Mezvinsky said.  His admission caused Chelsea to launch into an inexorable rant against Mezvinsky, calling him a “spineless, sorry excuse of man, no backbone, no balls, piss-poor excuse of a husband. You keep your fucking mouth shut, that’s what you do, Marc.” Her outburst, Rear Adm. Crandall said, denoted a blatant contempt of courtroom civility, and he cautioned her to respect the court under threat of being gagged for the rest of the trial.  “During your testimony on Tuesday, Mr. Mezvinsky, you stated you were responsible for destroying evidence of Clinton crimes. But that’s not entirely true, is it? In your deposition, you told JAG you had screenshotted spreadsheets containing thousands of, how shall I put this, anagrammed names of both smuggled children and their intended recipients, including dollar amounts they were to be sold for. Is that correct?” Rear Adm. Crandall asked.  Mezvinsky nodded, saying he need “an insurance policy” against Clinton retaliation, in case they turned on him.  Rear Adm. Crandall approached the 3 officers tasked with judging the military’s evidence on Clinton. He laid on the table a ream of paper, saying the documents, regardless of muddled names, conclusively proved that Chelsea Clinton had authorized the selling of children who had been smuggled into the United States from countries such as Haiti, Columbia, and the Ukraine.  One recipient’s anagram–Tindus Komsovitz—appeared 11 times. Rear Adm. Crandall told the tribunal that U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command at Ft. Meade had rigorously scrutinized the database and deduced that “Tindus Komsovitz” was really Facebook Co-Founder Dustin Moskovitz, a longtime friend of the Clintons who had donated millions of dollars to Hillary Clinton’s election campaigns.  “I ask you, directly, Mr. Mezvinsky—did you and Chelsea Clinton sell children to Dustin Moskovitz?”  Rivulets of tears streamed down Mezvinsky’s face. “I’m sorry, yes, him and so, so many others.”  “And you’ll provide us the names you—” Rear Adm. Crandall started, but Chelsea rose to her feet and again lambasted her husband.  “You’ll keep your fucking mouth shut,” Clinton blurted, her voice a witch’s cackle.  Per Rear Adm. Crandall’s instructions, a pair of Marines gagged Clinton and dragged her from the chamber.  Rear Adm. Crandall asked the panel whether it had heard enough, and the officers unanimously found Chelsea Clinton guilty of all charges and recommended she be executed for crimes against humanity and for destroying the lives of countless families. Rear Adm. Crandall, however, admitted to quandary—could the U.S. military execute Clinton given the absence of evidence that she was guilty of murdering an American citizen or committing treason as stipulated under the Insurrection Act of 1812, the U.S. Constitution, or the Patriot Act.  Sentencing, Rear Adm. Crandall said, would commence “in days.”  “She will either be hanged or spend life at GITMO,” Rear Adm. Crandall said.

128,121134728971857760974547929716810845044,"U.S. Special Forces arrested former President George W. Bush Saturday morning at his Crawford, Texas, ranch following a blistering firefight with Secret Service agents and private security contractors assigned to protect him.  On Friday evening, a Special Forces “Alpha Detachment” stationed at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, received from U.S. Army Special Operations Command orders to infiltrate the ranch and arrest the 43rd president. SF were told to expect resistance because recent intelligence on the ranch showed that Bush had surrounded himself with armed private security contractors in addition to the trio of Secret Service agents that routinely patrolled the grounds.  Transportation to the ranch was provided by the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, nicknamed Night Stalkers, a group of highly skilled chopper pilots that conduct transport, attack, assault, and reconnaissance missions, at night, at low altitude, and on short notice. The choppers had to make 3 refueling stops to reach their destination.  Under cover of darkness early Saturday morning, the choppers descended into a clearing near the southeast corner of Bush’s 1,600-acre ranch, far from the staff trailers and the main house where they hoped to find Bush sleeping. After offloading SF, the choppers ascended into the night to await a call for exfiltration.  A military source familiar with the mission told Real Raw News that Special Operations Command had obtained detailed satellite imagery of the property as well as locations of trail cams that live-streamed to a communications bunker 100 yards from the main building.  “Intelligence estimated that Bush had 20 security contractors and 3 Secret Service on the property. The plan was to exploit blind spots in the surveillance cameras, ingress to the main building, subdue Bush’s personal guards, and drag him to the exfil point without alerting the larger security force. But something went horribly wrong,” our source said.  Special Forces had approached to within 200 yards of the main house when all hell broke loose.  Two open-top ATVs, each with a driver and 3 security personnel, sped out of the darkness and toward the encroaching SF unit, the headlights momentarily illuminating the soldiers as they separated into groups and dove for cover. Bush’s security unleashed a hailstorm of suppressive fire, wounding one soldier and killing another. While one SF group engaged the enemy, the other dashed toward the main house, hoping to capture Bush before he could be evacuated on his own private helicopter, which sat parked near the main structure.  “The battle turned in our favor quickly. SF took cover behind a rock wall and with the aid of NVGs shot out the tires on both vehicles and then killed or grievously wounded Bush’s security. But they knew there was still at least a dozen patrolling the property and they would’ve been alerted and on their way. Time was of the essence,” our source said.  The second SF unit reached the main house just as 2 Secret Service agents emerged and began steering Bush, still in his pajamas, to an armored limousine parked alongside dense shrubbery. SF instructed them to halt and throw up their hands, but the agents wheeled around and drew weapons, only to be killed a second later.  Somewhere on the property a deafening klaxon blared like an air raid siren.  “They gagged and bagged Bush, then regrouped. They couldn’t make the exfil point, not with one KIA and a teammate with a sucking chest wound. They radioed for pickup where they stood. A pilot told them that enemy forces were mobilizing near the staff trailers, and they had only minutes to get out of there. The birds weren’t armed for combat; otherwise, they could’ve hosed down those trailers,” our source said.  The choppers touched down only long enough to retrieve SF and their package, avoiding further conflict.  Our source said that JAG and the Office of Military Commissions had long sought Bush’s arrest. He did not say why it waited so long or why it felt such an impetus to grab Bush Saturday morning. Bush, he said, has been charged with treason and is being held to account for the deaths of thousands of soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan and for his role in masterminding 9/11, in addition to other crimes.  “He will face a military tribunal,” our source said.

Likewise, at 3:42 in the morning, a dump of 143,379 votes came in to the state of Wisconsin, also miraculously, given to Biden. Where did these “votes” come from? Both were State Election changing events, and that is on top of the other corruption without even including the fact that neither state got Legislative approval, which is required under the United States Constitution.  Also, note something that we called HORSESH*T the day after the election. The state of Wisconsin have an 89% turnout in the election.  Umm. That didn’t happen.  This ratio was impossible as well and indicated likely fraud.  Why doesn’t Speaker Vos want to look into this?

At 3:00 a.m., Delta Force cut the lock on a barbwire fence that protected an 8,500-square-foot warehouse just south of Pier 33 near San Francisco Bay. Equipped with innovative weaponry and night vision goggles, the operators pushed toward the warehouse and, after failing to cut through a reinforced lock on the warehouse door, blew open the door using a shaped C-4 charge. They hurled flashbang grenades into the warehouse, stunning two chemists who had been hovering over an assortment of beakers and vials.  They subdued the chemists with zip ties, and then made a shocking discovery—15 industrial freezers brimming with bags of chilled Adrenochrome, 600 liters in all.  Delta Force also found 100 bags of whole blood in a locked refrigerator.  Each bag was dated with an indelible marker, ostensibly reflecting the date it was filled. The most recent inscribed date was October 16, two before the raid.  One Delta Force operator described the scene as a “macabre mad science lab with beakers and test tubes and other chemistry gear covering several stainless-steel tables.”  Our source said Delta confiscated everything in the laboratory and transported the items to an unknown location for destruction.  “We took what we need for evidence; the rest has been destroyed. There’s going to be a lot of unhappy elitists out there looking for their Adrenochrome injections or infusions. It’s likely this was just one of many clandestine storage units and labs,” our source said.  Asked whether the military had been tipped off by a Deep State official, like the ones who had been tried and executed at Guantanamo Bay, he said the following: “No. I’m sure if criminals such as Hillary or Podesta knew the locations of these places, the stuff would have been moved immediately following their capture. None of them shared info on Adrenochrome storage. This location was not a mobile lab, it was fixed, and they’d been there quite a while.”  (Visited 195,061 times, 15 visits today)",Delta Force Raids Adrenochrome Warehouse,false

Their immune systems are deteriorating at around 5% per week (between 2.7% and 8.7%). If this continues then 30-50 year olds will have 100% immune system degradation, zero viral defence by Christmas and all doubly vaccinated people over 30 will have lost their immune systems by March next year.  By a concerned reader  (Read the latest update of this article here – ‘It’s worse than we thought – A comparison of official Government reports suggest the Fully Vaccinated are developing Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome much faster than anticipated’)  The 5 PHE tables below from their excellent Vaccine Surveillance Report, separated by 4 weeks, clearly show the progressive damage that the vaccines are doing to the immune system’s response.    People aged 40-69 have already lost 40% of their immune system capability and are losing it progressively at 3.3% to 6.4% per week.  Weekly Decline in doubly vaccinated immune system performance compared to unvaccinated people…  Everybody over 30 will have lost 100% of their entire immune capability (for viruses and certain cancers) within 6 months.  30-50 year olds will have lost it by Christmas. These people will then effectively have full blown acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and destroy the NHS.    The vaccine booster shots have to be the same as the vaccines themselves, because it takes forever to do clinical trials and get approval for something different. So if you take a booster shot, these figures show that you are giving yourself an even faster progressive form of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (after a couple of months of effectiveness).

The figures above indicate that their figures may well have been correct immediately after vaccination (the younger age groups have had the vaccine for the shortest time).  But the figures above also show that the vaccines do NOT merely lose efficiency over time down to zero efficiency, they progressively damage the immune system until a negative efficiency is realised.

133,7680489079867068140564496336735896469,"The disreputable, faux Biden administration and its media cohorts have perpetrated yet another fallacy on the American public by claiming that Colin Powell died of “Covid-19 complications” despite being fully vaccinated. Although breakthrough infections that result in death are becoming more common and broadly reported by alternative media, Colin Powell had never received a positive Covid-19 diagnosis or displayed symptoms commonly associated with the China virus, said an administration whistleblower speaking under promise of anonymity.  The administration and the media have released scant details on his death, obfuscating both where he died and the approximate time of death, but were quick to blame his demise on Covid-19.  Powell, who had suffered from multiple myeloma, a blood cancer, committed suicide early Monday morning, our source said.  “Powell died at home after consuming a bottle of prescription sleeping pills,” he said.  According to him, Powell’s wife Alma awoke at 3:00 a.m. and noticed that her husband was not breathing. She discovered an empty bottle of Ambien, which had been nearly full the night previous, tucked amid the bedsheets.  “Alma called 911. She said the bottle was almost full because Colin had filled it only a few days ago. 911 routed the Call directly to the White House, which has never been heard of. No paramedics, no ambulances showed up at his McClean, Virginia, home—only the FBI,” our source said.  Two FBI Special Agents and an agency forensic pathologist arrived at the Powell’s residence shortly after 4:00 a.m. They found Mrs. Powell in a state of hysteria, screaming and crying at the top her lungs as she hovered over late husband’s corpse. After a thorough examination of the bedroom, one agent found what appeared to be a suicide note on the floor beside the Powell’s bed.  “I’ll love you always, Alma, you and the children. But I am old and sick, and I know they’ll find me soon, like they have the others. I don’t want my legacy to end that way. I pray you can all forgive me, for what I’ve done, and now what I no longer have to do. The man in the glass tower must not rise. I place myself in the Lord’s hands; I’d rather He judge me than them,” part of the note purportedly read.  Powell, who had identified as a Republican, was a RINO—Republican in name only. He was an outspoken opponent of Donald J. Trump, and he had endorsed both Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden’s bids for the presidency.  “The FBI made a call directly to Kamala Harris, and she told them they’d have to spin the death to make it appear as if he died from Covid,” our source said. “The FBI is a tool of the Deep State.”  The administration and the CDC have been instructing health institutions and city and county coroners to falsify death certificates to make it seem as if every human fatality over the last two years was a result of Covid-19.

134,54688712778267922348610211453294770038,"On Monday afternoon, former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo learned his fate, having been held responsible for the needless deaths of thousands of senior citizens who perished during the first wave of a largely manufactured global plandemic. He was sentenced to death after a 3-officer panel at Guantanamo Bay heard testimony from former members of Cuomo’s staff, nursing home and hospice employees, and the worker of a freight company who claimed Cuomo had threatened to bankrupt the company unless it converted 18-wheelers into a fleet of roving freezers and crematoriums.  From the moment he entered the courtroom, Cuomo was combative, belligerent, and argumentative, hurling obscenities at both Rear Adm. Darse E. Crandall and the panel chosen to weigh the merits of the military’s case against him. He admonished the Office of Military Commissions, calling it an affront to the criminal justice system and the “American way of life.”  “Never in my gubernatorial career or my years as a lawyer have I seen such a fucking miscarriage of justice. You people are really pieces of shit,” Cuomo said during a brief opening statement.  The brevity of his argument was not by choice. Had he the chance, Cuomo would have castigated the court until his voice went hoarse. But Rear Adm. Crandall quickly put an end to Cuomo’s theatrics and shenanigans by instructing GITMO security to gag his mouth and shackle his ankles to a chair.  “We have zero tolerance for staginess and theatricality in this chamber,” Rear Adm. Crandall said. “The witnesses will be heard.”  The first witness to appear on ZOOM was a woman named Michelle Steiger, a former administrator at the Cobble Hill Health Center in Brooklyn. She testified that on March 26, 2020, the facility received a sudden influx of alleged Covid-19 patients, 65 in all, from area hospitals, even though the senior living facility had enough beds to accommodate less than half that amount.  Ms. Steiger: We were told the patients had Covid-19 and ordered to take them into our facility  Rear Adm. Crandall: Ordered how?  Ms. Steiger: We received documents signed by Andrew Cuomo and the health commissioner, Howard Zucker, saying that they’d pull state funding unless we accepted all Covid-19 patients sent to us. Few of our existing patients had tested positive, and of the first 65 they sent us, only 7 were positive for Covid-19. But we were told to say they all had Covid-19, because we’d be better financially compensated, even in the absence of a positive PCR test. We were told to falsify medical records, to say people who didn’t have Covid-19 had it. And to expect a new group of patients every week.  Rear Adm. Crandall: But Cobble Hill Health had no room for that many more patients?  Ms. Steiger: That’s correct. In another correspondence, we were told not to worry about that because a pickup was to be arranged each week to remove existing Covid patients and replace them with new ones.  Rear Adm. Crandall: Replace them? Had they died—of Covid-19?  Ms. Steiger: I’m unaware of any patient dying from or with Covid-19. In our environment, people die, yes, of heart attacks and non-Covid respiratory ailments. But we were told to code all deaths as Covid fatalities.  Rear Adm. Crandall: I see. Certainly not all patients in your ward suddenly dropped dead. What happened to the ones who were alive to make room for new patients the hospitals sent to you?  Ms. Steiger: For the live ones, trucks, like the ones that haul frozen goods across the country, arrived every other week or so, and the patients were taken and placed in the trucks. I don’t know where they went or what happened after that, but these were old and frail people, and there’s no way they survived long in refrigerated trucks.  Rear Adm. Crandall: And the patients who had expired, for whatever reason.  Ms. Steiger: Different kinds of trucks, fitted with furnaces. The bodies were hurled into them.  Rear Adm. Crandall: Didn’t you realize the criminality of your actions and participation, Ms. Steiger?”  Ms. Steiger: Of course. But I—we—were afraid, afraid of losing our jobs and of other things. One staff member who threatened to go to the press was told CPS would take her children if she didn’t keep quiet and follow instructions.  Rear Adm. Crandall: One last question. Why transport people from hospitals to nursing homes at all? Why wouldn’t he just have had these alleged Covid patients picked up at the hospitals?  Ms. Steiger: I could only speculate.  Rear Adm. Crandall: The tribunal will indulge your speculation given that you’ve spent 25 years working in the facilities, but the officers are instructed to not consider your statement as evidence.  Ms. Steiger: Hospitals are enormous institutions with thousands of people, most of them pretty healthy. If someone did have Covid, there’d be a risk of the infection spreading across all the staff and patients. Hospital acquired infection is a leading cause of death in hospitals. The infirmed at nursing homes are very old and very sick and don’t have much life left in them. I guess it was no big deal if they died.”  Rear Adm. Crandall: Finally, did you receive any compensation for going along with this agenda?  Ms. Steiger: I did not.  Rear Adm. Crandall excused the witness and slid documents onto the table behind which the 3-officer panel was seated. The papers bore the signatures of Andrew Cuomo and Howard Zucker. One, which Cuomo had sent to 8 nursing homes in lower New York State, instructed staff to “assume patients were Covid-19 positive regardless of test results if they exhibited even a single symptom of the illness,” such as coughing, sneezing, wheezing, or shortness of breath.  “We cannot jeopardize the health of the general population. All patients exhibiting symptoms of Covid-19 should presumptively be considered to have it unless directed otherwise by New York State Health and Human Services,” Cuomo or Zucker had written.  After a brief recess, Rear Adm. Crandall introduced the next witness, Marco Miranda, a former driver for Brooklyn-based freight carrier BZC. He said he had been employed with BZC for 15 years and had spent most of that time hauling produce between the United States in Canada. In March of 2020, however, the company had given him new instructions.  Rear Adm Crandall: Mr. Miranda, in your deposition you said you were one of several drivers who picked up patients at Cobble Hill Health Center, is that correct?  Mr. Miranda: Cobble Hill and other places.  Rear Adm. Crandall: And that operating on instructions given by BZC, you moved patients from those facilities into refrigerated tract—”  Mr. Miranda: I didn’t move nobody. The staff at those places moved them and put’em in the truck. Me and my partner just did the driving, that’s all.”  Rear Adm. Crandall: But you can confirm they were alive when placed in the vehicle?”  Mr. Miranda: Oh, yeah, they were breathing all right. Some of them even flailed their arms and the nursing home people sedated them for transport.  Rear Adm. Crandall: How were they stored?  Mr. Miranda: Bunks, cots, 3-high were installed on either side of the trailer. They were put there and strapped down.  Rear Adm. Crandall: What is the temperature inside a refrigerated trailer?  Mr. Miranda: Oh, it’s like your fridge at home, we can dial up or dial down the temp, anywhere from 65 to -20 Fahrenheit. We were told to bottom out the thermostat.  Rear Adm. Crandall: Did you know that the persons inside, who were alive, would not survive long in those temperatures?  Mr. Miranda: Wasn’t my business. I did what I was told. Look, man, you didn’t cross the Cuomo brothers—if you did, bad shit would happen to you and your family. I have a wife and 3 kids to think about.  Rear Adm. Crandall: So you’re saying with certitude that Cuomo was behind the orders?  Mr. Miranda: We knew who was calling the shots.  Rear Adm. Crandall: Where were the patients taken?  Mr. Miranda: There was a mass grave site dug on Hart Island. We drove to City Island, and people was waiting to unload the bodies and put’em on a ferry to Hart. I never touched a single one of them. All I did was drive.  Rear Adm. Crandall: In your deposition, you said you saw Cuomo at the unloading site, is that correct?  Mr. Miranda. I saw the bastard. Even snapped a pic on my phone.  Rear Adm. Crandall entered into evidence a photograph of Andrew Cuomo standing beside six men in HAZMAT suits who were unloading frozen corpses from the trailer and moving them onto the ferry.  Rear Adm. Crandall: Just a few more questions. Ballpark figure, how many persons did you transport between March and September of 2020.  Mr. Miranda: Thousands. And we wasn’t the only one. We had five trucks going all the time.  Rear Adm. Crandall: And were you promised anything in return for your testimony today?  Mr. Miranda: No. I know what we did was wrong. But we were scared. Like I said, you don’t fuck with the Cuomo brothers. I just pray God forgives me.  The last witness to appear was none other than Melissa DeRosa, who had been Cuomo’s principal ally, aide, and mouthpiece. She resigned her position after many women accused the former governor of sexual harassment. She provided to the Office of Military Commissions countless papers and electronic files that corroborated the testimony of earlier witnesses.  Rear Adm. Crandall: Mrs. DeRosa, we know you’re reluctant to speak here today, but can you say as fact that your former employer, Andrew Cuomo, seated before us here today, did indeed profit from the actions he’s alleged to have taken and that he did so to foster an agenda—that agenda being to artificially amplify the threat Covid-19?  Mrs. DeRosa: Yes, I can testify to that. The documents I’ve provided spell it all out.  Rear Adm. Crandall: And do you know as fact that Andrew Cuomo is responsible for the murders of thousands of senior citizens who might otherwise be alive today were it not for his actions?  Mrs. DeRosa: Tens of thousands.  Rear Adm. Crandall: Were you afraid of Cuomo?  Mrs. DeRosa: Terrified.  After excusing the witness, Rear Adm. Crandall instructed the tribunal to carefully read the documents and to thoroughly consider the testimony it had heard. The panel sequestered itself in an antechamber and deliberated for three hours before returning a verdict of guilty on all counts, recommending that Andrew Cuomo be hanged for his crimes.  An execution date is pending.  (Visited 225,573 times, 8 visits today)",Military Convicts Andrew Cuomo,false

137,139924374180619967196409555904041689472,"Arthur Roberts, the 83-year-old C-List actor who portrays Joseph Biden on television and in person, blew his cover during a televised press conference with UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson earlier this week. In a stunning scene seen by many, Biden’s (RRN uses the term ‘Biden’ to stand for either Biden or his body doubles) handlers abruptly and seemingly without cause ushered the press pool from the White House Briefing Room while Johnson tried to field questions from British journalists in attendance.  The stunned press pool protested as security forcibly ejected them, clueless as to why they, the administration’s MSM allies, were being rudely told to leave.  On Wednesday, Jen Psaki, who is currently under military investigation, said the room was cleared because Johnson’s questions were not preapproved, but a whistleblower in the fake administration’s communications office revealed to RRN what actually transpired during the surreal briefing.  As reported previously, it is RRN’s contention that the real Joseph R. Biden has not been seen in public since shortly after the 2020 presidential election. The reason is that, in early February, he suffered a massive stroke that left him brain dead and hospitalized at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where he has lain comatose ever since. Biden’s Deep State handlers had had high hopes for Kamala Harris, and had intended that she would succeed him, but it soon became apparent that she lacked fortitude and the mental acuity needed to coalesce the liberal base. Much to her chagrin, she was put on the backburner while the Deep State sought body double replacements who could play a convincing Joe Biden.  One such find was Arthur Roberts, an obscure 80s actor whose capstone cinematic achievement was playing the evil ninja, Braden, in the 1984 martial arts flick Revenge of the Ninja. After that, he faded into obscurity, henceforth obtaining only minor roles in film and television productions, until the Deep State grabbed him as a potential Biden replacement in early March.  Roberts, no spring chicken himself and older than the genuine Biden, apparently has a touch of dementia, which caused him to veer off script and raise suspicion in the eyes of Boris Johnson.  In a moment not caught on microphone and spoken softly enough for the press pool to not overhear, Roberts began lamenting to Johnson his failed film career, and he asked the UK Prime Minister whether he had seen the films Little Miss Magic and Up in Smoke, in which he had minor roles.  A theatrically masked Boris Johnson, our source said, discretely muted his microphone and spoke softly in Roberts’ direction, asking, “You’re not Joe Biden. Who the bloody hell are you?”  “Even though he muted his mic, Jen Psaki and White House Communications Director Kate Bedingfield were in another office, and able to overhear the entire discourse through hidden parabolic mics in the briefing room. They, how should I put this, freaked the fuck out. They began screaming into Roberts’ hidden earpiece to get back on script or read only from the teleprompter. That’s when Roberts silenced his own mic and told Boris he was only joking around. But Psaki feared the situation would deteriorate, and she immediately ordered the room cleared,” our source said.  He added that a bewildered Johnson later asked Psaki “what the hell just happened,” and was told to forget the entire incident, unless the UK wanted to lose all U.S. support.

138,76843441503493252304942628948139343325,"On Saturday morning U.S. Marines from Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, apprehended a Deep State asset whose name laymen may find unfamiliar but who, from the shadows, has influenced the illegal Biden administration’s domestic policy decisions on a grand scale. That person is Anita Dunn, a political strategist who served as Biden’s chief advisor until her resignation on August 12. Although Dunn declined to comment on her reasons, she abruptly quit her position after FOX News unearthed a quote attributed to her; at a 2009 speech to graduating high schoolers, Dunn said Chinese dictator Mao Zedong was one of her “favorite political philosophers,” Moreover, she refused to file the public financial disclosure required of every other presidential appointee.  But Dunn’s departure was in name only. She felt she would wield greater authority and draw less scrutiny operating outside official channels, sentiment shared by her peers—a consortium of vile villains the military aptly refers to as the Biden administration’s “brain trust.” These fastidious fanatics, Dunn among them, have worked arduously to dismantle the U.S. military, defund domestic law enforcement, strengthen the ANTIFA and BLM movements, drive inflation, bankrupt businesses, push vaccination and mask mandates, and embolden foreign adversaries like China.  A JAG source speaking under promise of anonymity told RRN that Dunn had met privately with Deep State Dr. Fauci 7 times since January. At a May meeting Dunn, who has no medical credentials, whimsically suggested to Dr. Fauci that Americans ought to receive quarterly Covid-19 vaccinations, and Fauci, who is an M.D. but has not treated patients since 1977, replied, “Of course it’s a great idea. The more shots we get in arms, the better.”  “I can’t speak to how we obtained recordings of their conversations, but we have them. They had several meets discussing how best to enforce vaccination mandates, and at each meeting they upped the number of shots they thought people should get every year. Dunn’s family has strong ties to the pharmaceutical lobbying industry, and Dr. Fauci has earned enormous profit from vaccine sales. It’s important to remember that Dunn was groomed by Obama. We have her on tape saying that people that die from the vaccine are just collateral damage,” our source said.  Dunn also advocated lockdowns on behalf of the illegitimate administration. In early 2021, she made multiple trips to California, Michigan, and New York to lobby the states’ respective governors to maintain draconian-style lockdowns and bankrupt as many businesses as possible—so the owners would have no choice but to rely on federal assistance, a tenet of Socialism.  “This woman was a major player in the Deep State’s plandemic conspiracy. And even now, as those plandemic plans come crashing down around them, they’re trying to double down and lockdown this country like Australia and Germany. The evidence against Dunn is massive, and it compelled JAG and the OMC to seek her arrest,” our source said.  On Friday, November 19, Rear Adm. David G. Wilson of JAG reached out to Gen. David Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps, with instructions to “apprehend immediately and discretely Anita Dunn at her Bethesda, Maryland, home.”  It should be noted that Bethesda is a stronghold of Deep State activity, as if the Deep State hierarchy instructs its agents to congregate there for mutual protection. Yet they have been picked off one by one.  Gen. Berger acknowledged the instruction and ordered his subordinates to at once assemble a team to grab Dunn. Early Saturday morning an unknown number of Marines from the 2nd Marine Raider Battalion descended on Dunn’s home. They found Dunn asleep beside her husband Bob Bauer, another Obama stooge, and subdued them with zip ties and duct tape before they could come to their senses and start a fuss.  “The Marines apprehended both out of necessity.

139,152268304197102830214965820369934196688,"A preprint paper by the prestigious Oxford University Clinical Research Group, published Aug. 10 in The Lancet, found vaccinated individuals carry 251 times the load of COVID-19 viruses in their nostrils compared to the unvaccinated.  Miss a day, miss a lot. Subscribe to The Defender's Top News of the Day. It's free.  A groundbreaking preprint paper by the prestigious Oxford University Clinical Research Group, published Aug. 10 in The Lancet, includes alarming findings devastating to the COVID vaccine rollout.  The study found vaccinated individuals carry 251 times the load of COVID-19 viruses in their nostrils compared to the unvaccinated.  While moderating the symptoms of infection, the jab allows vaccinated individuals to carry unusually high viral loads without becoming ill at first, potentially transforming them into presymptomatic superspreaders.  This phenomenon may be the source of the shocking post-vaccination surges in heavily vaccinated populations globally.  The paper’s authors, Chau et al, demonstrated widespread vaccine failure and transmission under tightly controlled circumstances in a hospital lockdown in Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam.  The scientists studied healthcare workers who were unable to leave the hospital for two weeks. The data showed that fully vaccinated workers — about two months after injection with the Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine (AZD1222) — acquired, carried and presumably transmitted the Delta variant to their vaccinated colleagues.  They almost certainly also passed the Delta infection to susceptible unvaccinated people, including their patients. Sequencing of strains confirmed the workers transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to one another.  This is consistent with the observations in the U.S. from Farinholt and colleagues, and congruent with comments by the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conceding COVID-19 vaccines have failed to stop transmission of SARS-CoV-2.  On Feb. 11, the World Health Organization indicated the AZD1222 vaccine efficacy of 63.09% against the development of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. The conclusions of the Chau paper support the warnings by leading medical experts that the partial, non-sterilizing immunity from the three notoriously “leaky” COVID-19 vaccines allow carriage of 251 times the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 as compared to samples from the pre-vaccination era in 2020.  Thus, we have a key piece to the puzzle explaining why the Delta outbreak is so formidable — fully vaccinated are participating as COVID-19 patients and acting as powerful Typhoid Mary-style super-spreaders of the infection.  Vaccinated individuals are blasting out concentrated viral explosions into their communities and fueling new COVID surges. Vaccinated healthcare workers are almost certainly infecting their coworkers and patients, causing horrendous collateral damage.  Continued vaccination will only make this problem worse, particularly among frontline doctors and nurses workers who are caring for vulnerable patients.  Health systems should drop vaccine mandates immediately, take stock of COVID-19 recovered workers who are robustly immune to Delta and consider the ramifications of their current vaccinated healthcare workers as potential threats to high risk patients and coworkers.  CLARIFICATION: The comparison of viral load between vaccinated and unvaccinated (pre-vaccine era) as reported in the Chau et al. 2021 Lancet preprint is between two different variants of SARS-CoV-2. Dr. McCullough states directly that samples were compared to those “from the pre-vaccination era of 2020.” Thus, differences between these two groups aren’t a result of vaccination status alone. The authors of the Chau et al. 2021 study in their rebuttal to our piece point out another preprint (Li et al. 2021) which reported a difference in viral load of ~1000 between patients infected with the Delta variant and patients infected with A/B. However, the vaccination status of the Delta variant patients in this preprint is not reported. Thus, no one here has done a direct comparison between unvaccinated Delta patients and unvaccinated A/B patients to determine the true difference in viral load. In two additional preprint scientific publications (Riemersma et al. 2021, Chia et al. 2021), comparable viral loads of the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 are reported among vaccinated and unvaccinated patients. However, this itself is an indictment of vaccine efficacy as both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals possess the ability to spread the Delta variant. Simply stated, COVID vaccines have failed to stop transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","Study: Fully Vaccinated Healthcare Workers Carry 251 Times Viral Load, Pose Threat to Unvaccinated Patients, Co-Workers",false
140,266395614791875836926396928370420406227,"Marine Corps General David H. Berger on Monday rebuked Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin’s edict requiring all Armed Forces personnel to submit to Covid-19 vaccinations under threat of court martial or discharge, said a source in Gen. Berger’s office who overheard a heated conversation between them.  Gen. Berger telephoned the defense secretary minutes after he said in a press conference that the Covid-19 vaccination is needed to maintain military readiness and that he would enforce the mandatary vaccination policy regardless of FDA approval status.  “There will be no mandatory vaccinations for my Marines,” Gen. Berger said.  In a transcript of the call reviewed by Real Raw News, Gen. Berger lambasted Austin and branded him a traitor.  “Under no circumstances will Marines be compelled to take a potentially hazardous vaccination that the FDA won’t even fully endorse,” Gen. Berger told Austin. “You are a coward and a traitor, manipulated by people pushing bad policy on the men and women who provide security to our nation. Neither you nor your puppet president has authority to enforce such a policy.”  Austin argued that mandatory vaccinations have always been a requirement for soldiers enlisting into the Armed Forces, and they, as property of the U.S. government, have no right to decide whether to take the Covid-19 jab. The federal government and President Biden would decide for them, Austin said.  “They’re incapable of making informed decisions. So we, their leaders, make the big decisions they cannot,” Austin said. “Biden and Harris are in charge, not individual soldiers.”  Then Austin got political: “If conservatives and evangelicals see our fighting forces getting vaccinated, they’ll be more likely to get vaccinated themselves,” Austin said.  Gen. Berger said it was unfair to compare established vaccinations with a product that was rushed to market with little concern for side effects. He called the CDC and Dr. Fauci corrupt, and he asked Austin why the puppet administration hid from the public an NIH report linking the vaccination to thousands of fatalities.  “If someone dies, you say it was Covid-19. There’s a refusal to admit the vaccination carries side effects that can include death in certain individuals.”  “I’m not a physician. I’m the Secretary of Defense for Joseph R. Biden, and I follow orders,” Austin retorted.  “In case you haven’t heard, Biden’s not in charge of the military, and neither are you. You can sell whatever lies you want to the media. You sold your soul, Lloyd, and I hope you can live with yourself,” Gen. Berger said.  Gen. Berger said he had the support of other Joint Chiefs of Staff and would implore them to ignore unlawful orders coming from the illegitimate administration.  “If a soldier wants the vaccination, fine. If not, he’s not rolling up his sleeve. If you try to forcibly vaccinate even one of my Marines, you better come armed,” Gen. Berger said, and hung up the phone.  In a statement Monday afternoon, Biden said he strongly supports Austin’s message and that he is “eager to see” the Covid-19 vaccination added to the battery of vaccinations soldiers receive upon joining the military.

142,225477679296468901121622447952821522587,"Actor Tom Hanks has left the earth, put to death by a military tribunal that found him guilty of pedophilia and child endangerment.  On June 12, the U.S. military apprehended Hanks after a plane he had chartered in Greece, where he held dual citizenship, landed at Malpensa Airport in Milan, Italy, where Hanks had been scheduled to attend a foreign film festival.  U.S. military sources told RRN that members of the 173rd Airborne Combat Brigade and INTERPOL were awaiting Hanks’ arrival when the Learjet 75 reached the airport apron. Weapons drawn, they boarded the plane and found Hanks seated beside longtime friend Peter Scolari, who in 1980 starred alongside Hanks in the TV sitcom Bosom Buddies, in which the duo portrayed transvestites living in an all-female college dormitory. Hanks would later say it was his favorite role, and that wearing women’s clothes made him feel more manly.  The military released Scolari but shackled and promptly ushered Hanks aboard a waiting C-130, which had to be refueled twice inflight to reach Diego Garcia, where the Office of Military Commissions has built a penitentiary near its B2 bomber base. Upon landing, Hanks was placed in a holding cell to await his military tribunal.  Ten days later, Hanks had his day in court, with the U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General’s Corps presenting proof connecting Hanks to a child trafficking ring that, the military alleged, had worked in the shadows for 30 years. It presented into evidence many electronic devices—laptops and cellphones—that held photographs and videos of Hanks engaged in sexual intercourse with male children who were obviously below the age of consent.  Other videos showed Hanks involved in adrenochrome parties, gatherings at which the liberal elite and Hollywood A-listers comingle and inject into themselves an ungodly chemical compound made of oxidized adrenaline, which is extracted from frightened and tortured children, and synthetic opiates. Those who partake in the luciferian ritual believe the compound prevents illness, extends life, and enhances sexual prowess.  One video showed Hanks and songstress Lady GaGa injecting each other while an unseen child’s screams, the wailing sound of death, echoed in the background.  The military’s case was built on 50 video clips and 2,000 images, sources told RRN.  The 3-officer panel, however, found the content so disturbing that it reached a verdict of guilty after watching four snippets.  Hanks, when asked if he had anything to say in his defense, showed no remorse for his crimes and told the tribunal that adult-child intercourse was “natural” and that he proudly supported NAMBLA, the North American Man-Boy Love Association, a pedophilia and pederasty advocacy organization in the United States.  The tribunal declared Hanks receive capital punishment and asked that his sentence be carried out expeditiously.  “My death won’t stop anything; we are everywhere,” Hanks said.  Three days later, Hanks received an injection other than adrenochrome. He was strapped to a gurney and had pancuronium bromide, potassium chloride, and midazolam injected into his veins. If any adrenochrome remained in his blood, it wasn’t potent enough to protect him against lethal injection.  (Visited 474,703 times, 62 visits today)",Military Executes Tom Hanks,false
143,96937410132542135152629626396821026387,"The U.S. military on Tuesday arrested Microsoft founder Bill Gates, charging the socially awkward misfit with child trafficking and other unspeakable crimes against America and its people.  Sources within the U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General’s Corps told Real Raw News that the military had spent months trying to find Gates, but the elusive billionaire had used his wealth and Deep State contacts to elude capture, somehow keeping a step ahead of the military’s manhunt.  But on Tuesday, July 27, Gates slipped up, and U.S. Marines were able to apprehend him at a property he secretly owned in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.  The charges against Gates cover a broad spectrum. He purportedly coerced the FDA into issuing emergency authorization on Covid-19 vaccines, knowing that the potentially dangerous pharmaceutical cocktail would not only endanger recipients but also scramble human DNA. JAG is also investigating whether vaccines contain synthetic nanoparticles manufactured by Microsoft and Swedish biotech company Biohax International. The military alleges that Gates stood to profit massively from vaccine sales. Gates, who has previously denied having a financial stake in the vaccines, earned at least $10 billion from the joint sales of the Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson vaccinations, according to JAG documents. JAG is holding Gates partly responsible for the deaths of 7,000 American citizens who died within 72 hours of receiving the drug.  Moreover, the military has charged Gates with masterminding a child trafficking ring, which he ran with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. As reported by RRN on 20 May, U.S. Navy Seals operating under JAG authority stormed Gates’ 492-acre ranch in northwest Wyoming and discovered a subterranean bunker where children had been temporarily housed prior to being sold into slavery. An SD card recovered at the scene showed a young girl in pajamas handcuffed to a bed and crying out for her mother. Off camera, a maniacal Gates could be heard encouraging the child to dress in high heels and lingerie so she could better please her “new mommy and daddy.”  That evidence, taken in tandem with Gates’ vaccine fraud, prompted the military to launch a global manhunt for the socially awkward but ruthlessly dangerous nerd.  Sources told RRN that Gates’ wife Melinda played a crucial role in his arrest.  “Initially she was reluctant to fully cooperate, because she felt that knowledge of her involvement might jeopardize the fortune she aims to get from the divorce settlement, most of which has not been paid. But JAG has evidence proving that she had knowledge of the child trafficking and told her she’d be charged alongside Bill if she didn’t cooperate. It turned out that Bill had been spamming her with enciphered emails only she could decode. He wanted to reconcile. The military used that to its advantage,” our source said.  Melinda finally answered him, our source added, and agreed to a meeting. She told Bill to name the time and place. In response, Bill Gates suggested a house he had owned in Myrtle Beach. Although the military had been conducting surveillance on all known Gates-owned properties, the Myrtle Beach house had escaped military notice, because Gates had purchased it under an alias.  When Gates showed up, the Marines were waiting, our source said.  He was taken into custody and is currently being detained at an unknown location pending transportation to Guantanamo Bay, our source added.

144,195567146821647531237035109042014655536,"Further evidence proving the Covid-19 vaccination programme is a huge failure has been released which confirms throughout the whole of August 80% of the people who allegedly died of Covid-19 had been vaccinated against the disease.  We’re living in strange times, and if you believe the Covid-19 vaccination programme is working because the authorities on the television tell you that it is, then you must surely find it extremely strange that the UK is in the middle of a third wave in the middle of summer? Especially when you consider that in summer 2020 Covid-19 deaths flat-lined to zero even though a Covid-19 injection was not available.  But the strangeness doesn’t end there, just take a look at the latest Covid-19 Statistical Report released by Public Health Scotland (PHS) on the 8th September 2021.  The report provides an array on data on testing, quarantining, vaccinations, cases, hospitalisations, and deaths but it doesn’t get very interesting until you read Table 15 which covers the number of Covid-19 positive cases by week and vaccination status.  Interesting because it shows that the majority of confirmed cases are now among the vaccinated population. In the most recent week from 28th August to 3rd September 2021 the report shows that there were 20,744 confirmed cases among the unvaccinated population, who are more likely to be tested for the simple reason they have not been vaccinated.  But it also shows that there were 5,508 confirmed cases among the partly vaccinated population, and 16,810 cases among the fully vaccinated population – two populations who are least likely to be tested due to be being vaccinated.  This means that between 28th August and 3rd September there were 22,318 cases among the vaccinated population – almost 2,000 more than the unvaccinated population.  The same can also be said for the week of 21st August to 27th August which saw 15,647 cases among the unvaccinated population and 22,234 cases among the vaccinated population, and the same can also be said for the previous two weeks before that.  The data actually shows that between 7th August 2021 and the 3rd September 2021 there were 47,580 cases among the unvaccinated population, 21,020 cases among the partly vaccinated population, and 41,748 cases among the fully vaccinated population. Meaning there were 15,188 more cases among the vaccinated population.  So now that we’ve cleared up that the experimental Covid-19 injections clearly do not prevent infection or spread of Covid-19, let’s find out if they prevent hospitalisations like the authorities claim.  According to table 16 of the report between the 28th August 2021 and the 3rd September 2021 there were 36 admissions to hospital related to Covid-19 among the unvaccinated over 60 population, whilst there were 7 admissions on the partly vaccinated population.  However, there were a huge 299 admissions among the fully vaccinated over 60 population, and the same pattern can be seen for the weeks previous all the way back to the 7th August 2021.  In all for the week of 28th August to 3rd September 2021 there were 271 hospitalisations among the entire unvaccinated population but 423 hospitalisations among the fully vaccinated population. If we base these hospitalisations occurring after the previous weeks confirmed cases then we can calculate the case-hospitalisation rate.  In the week beginning 21st August there were 15,647 confirmed cases among the unvaccinated population. Therefore based on the unvaccinated hospitalisation figures of 271 in the week beginning 28th August the case-hospitalisation rate is 1.7%. However, when we carry out the same calculation for the fully vaccinated population hospitalisations (423) and cases (14,519) we can see that the case-hospitalisation rate is 2.9%.  Therefore, this shows that the Covid-19 injections are increasing the risk of hospitalisation when exposed to Covid-19 by 70% rather than reducing the risk by the 95% claimed by the vaccine manufacturers and authorities.  So now that we’ve cleared up the Covid-19 injections increase the risk of hospitalisation rather than reducing it let’s find out if they prevent deaths like the authorities claim.  Table 17 of the Public Health Scotland report shows the number of deaths to have occurred via vaccination status. However, PHS have been very clever in the way they’ve presented the number of deaths. Because rather than present them on a week by week basis like they have with the number of cases and hospitalisations, they’ve instead included deaths all the way back to the 29th December.  This means they are including deaths from the height of the alleged second wave of Covid-19 where just 9% of the population had received a single dose, and just 0.1% of the entire population were fully vaccinated. Therefore, PHS are very sneakily able to give the impression that the majority of Covid-19 deaths are occurring among the unvaccinated population.  The above table is taken from the report released by Public Health Scotland on the 18th August 2021 and shows deaths due to Covid-19 by vaccination status between the 29th December 2020 and the 5th August 2021. As you can see anyone reading the report would be given the impression that the vaccines are doing a fantastic job at preventing death due to Covid-19.  But fast forward to the most recent report and you will find on Table 17 that there have been 3,102 deaths among the unvaccinated population, 279 deaths among the partly vaccinated population and 298 deaths among the fully vaccinated population between the 29th December and the 26th August 2021.  Therefore, the true number of deaths by vaccination status between the 5th August 2021 and the 26th August 2021 are as follows –  Unvaccinated population – 25 deaths  Partly vaccinated population – 6 deaths  Fully vaccinated population – 92 deaths  This means the unvaccinated population have accounted for just 20% of alleged Covid-19 deaths throughout the whole of August, whilst the fully vaccinated accounted for 75% of them. But couple the partly vaccinated deaths with the fully vaccinated deaths and you can see that throughout August 80% of deaths occurred among the vaccinated population.  However this makes it hard to work out the case-fatality rate so to do this we need to look at how many deaths occurred in the previous weeks report. Up to the 19th August there had been 3,096 deaths among the unvaccinated, 277 deaths among the partly vaccinated, and 264 deaths among the fully vaccinated.  Therefore, the true number of deaths by vaccination status between the 19th August 2021 and the 26th August 2021 are as follows –  Unvaccinated population – 6 deaths  Partly vaccinated population – 2 deaths  Fully vaccinated population – 34 deaths  If we base these deaths on occurring two weeks after the number of confirmed cases then we can work out the case-fatality rate.  In the week beginning 7th August there were 3,788 confirmed cases among the unvaccinated population. Therefore based on the unvaccinated death figures of 6 in the week beginning 19th August the case-fatality rate is 0.15%. However, when we carry out the same calculation for the fully vaccinated population hospitalisations (34) and cases (3,490) we can see that the case-hospitalisation rate is 1%.  Therefore, this shows that the Covid-19 injections are increasing the risk of death when exposed to Covid-19 by a huge 566% rather than reducing the risk by the 95% claimed by the vaccine manufacturers and authorities.  What’s even more concerning about this is that the number of confirmed cases among the fully vaccinated population have rose significantly in the most recent week compared to four weeks prior. Therefore the number of hospitalisations and deaths that could occur in the next few weeks could possibly be enough for the authorities to justify another lockdown.  The data clearly shows the jabs do not prevent infection or transmission, and it clearly shows that they are increasing the risk of hospitalisation and death rather than reducing the risk.",EXCLUSIVE – 80% of Covid-19 deaths in August were people who had been vaccinated according to Public Health data,mixture
145,204168055253944555338677855725036860837,"A military tribunal at Guantanamo Bay has convicted Microsoft Founder Bill Gates on charges including child trafficking, pedophilia, conspiracy, money laundering, murder, and public health endangerment—the conclusion of five days of heated testimony that repeatedly saw Vice Adm. John G. Hannink of the U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General’s Corps square off against attorney David Baluarte.  The fireworks continued Wednesday morning as Vice Adm. Hannink offered into evidence additional proof of Gates’ illicit ties to the vaccine industry. Documents obtained from Gates’ personal server outlined how he in 2011 distributed vaccines “carrying serious side effects up to and including death” to 41,000 children in poverty-stricken India, after meeting “mild” resistance from vaccine distributors in the U.S. Gates claimed the vaccination granted absolute immunity against a strain of “super polio” that was ravaging the impoverished.  Rather than inoculate recipients against polio, the vaccine exacerbated it and left over 40,000 children crippled or dead. And while cases of polio indeed were on the rise, the mysterious “super polio” was pure fiction, invented by Gates and a consortium of international vaccine distributors. Gates even travelled to India to help administer the product, which was often given orally, as a sign of good faith.  “By his own documents, Gates and his people had waged a massive marketing campaign to convince the people of India that his “super polio” was resilient to current vaccinations and that only his product, which he personally endorsed, could stave off the imaginary, virulent strain. He had the audacity to handfeed his poison to innocent children,” Vice Adm. Hannink addressed the tribunal.  Baluarte objected: “Let’s pretend a moment that this court is just. Let’s further pretend these outlandish tales are true. How, tell me, can an American military court prosecute for crimes against foreigners on foreign soil?”  “If all things were equal, that would be correct,” Vice Adm. Hannink admitted. “But all things are not equal. American missionaries worked alongside medical staff in India. Some of those American missionaries had young children—children who took the Gates vaccine.”  Six of six children, Vice Adm. Hannink said, developed complete and irreversible paralysis, followed by cerebral hemorrhaging and death within 90 days of inoculation.  Since the children were American citizens, born to American parents, the military had authority to prosecute Gates for their deaths, as is stipulated in the Insurrection Act of 1807, which Donald J. Trump activated prior to leaving office.  “Gates’ diabolical ventures didn’t stop with India,” Vice Adm. Hannink told the 3-officer panel. “Four years later, he repeated his so-called humanitarian mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo—that time claiming he’d developed a cure for HIV. And while we can’t prove any Americans died of that drug, we know at least 27,000 Africans did—and this all points to motive.”  Vice Adm. Hannink pivoted to more current events, questioning Gates’ relationship to Dr. Anthony Fauci.  “You met privately with Fauci five times, at his home and yours, between December 2019 and July 2020. Your own documents discussed ‘donating’ tens of millions of dollars to pharmaceutical manufacturers in exchange for getting 10 times your ‘investment’ back once vaccines were marketed. In your own words, Fauci approved of the idea. If you’re such a philanthropist, why were you expecting kickbacks?” Vice Adm. Hannink said.  Gates’ lawyer instructed him to not answer the question.  “And did you not discuss placing what you referred to as a ‘nano-centric biometric recorder’ into vaccines—a chip, as it were, that would send biomedical data of recipients back to the vaccine manufacturers and to the NIH and to the CDC without the recipient’s knowledge?” Vice Adm. Hannink went on. “This invasion of privacy—and we are working to determine if this took place and the scope—is just another of example of Gates’ madness. We believe the Office of Military Commissions has offered enough prove to convict the accused and sentence him to death. But that decision is in your hands,” he told the 3-officer panel.  The officers needed not one minute to reach a unanimous decision; they found Gates guilty on all charges and asked that he be hanged for his atrocities. Vice Adm. Hannink set an execution date of October 5, 2021.  (Visited 273,754 times, 10 visits today)",Military Convicts Bill Gates,false

Yet, time has shown that he was far from the patriot many of us considered him to be.  The Bushes were neither patriots nor great Republicans.  In fact, the battle wasn’t Republican vs. Democrat, but globalists vs. nationalists instead!  It was between the ones who truly love this country, and the ones who would try to destroy America in all ways possible.  Things are much clearer now.  The video below reveals one painful truth- GWB admits there were explosives used in 9/11!  Yet, he does not “come clean” and admits the truth, but he tells it just because he is not smart enough!  Watch it below:  This is not the first time allegations of explosions have been made, and a mountain of evidence indicates that it was a controlled demolition.  Actually, Trump stated the same the week of the wreckage.  Daily Commercial News reported:  “Despite strong contrary arguments, a McMaster University engineering professor steadfastly maintains the collapse of three World Trade Center buildings after the infamous 9/11 attacks can only be adequately explained if “controlled demolition” is part of the equation.  Robert Korol, a civil engineering professor emeritus and a fellow of the Canadian Society of Civil Engineering, authored a report with Steven Jones, former professor of physics at Brigham Young University, Anthony Szamboti, a mechanical design engineer in the aerospace and communications industries and Ted Walter, director of strategy and development for Architects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth (AE911Truth). The report was titled 15 Years Later: On the Physics of High-Rise Building Collapses published last year in the Europhysics News journal which is a magazine for the European physics community and owned by the European Physical Society.  In the controversial paper, the authors reflect the overarching premise of the AE911Truth, which has collected 2,936 signatures from engineers and architects. Among those petition signatories are 19 who earned their respective degrees in Canada, including 15 who live here.  AE911 Truth posits: “there is sufficient doubt about the official story and therefore the 9/11 investigation must be re-opened and must include a full inquiry into the possible use of explosives that might have been the actual cause of the destruction of the World Trade Center Twin Towers and Building 7.”  The group has long been controversial and its arguments have ignited many debates. The overwhelming consensus has favoured the official explanation which states that fires burning inside the buildings weakened the structural steel and triggered their collapse. This has consistently been reaffirmed by U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) over the last 16 years.  The Europhysics News editors also recognize the controversy, publishing the article with the following note: “This feature is somewhat different from our usual purely scientific articles, in that it contains some speculation. However, given the timing and the importance of the issue, we consider that this feature is sufficiently technical and interesting to merit publication for our readers. Obviously, the content of this article is the responsibility of the authors.”  Reached at his home in Dundas, Ont., Korol shrugs off the controversy.  “I’ve been scratching my head over this one since it happened on Sept. 11, 2001,” he says. “I just couldn’t understand how those buildings collapsed. It didn’t make sense.”  JEFFMOCK/WIKIMEDIA COMMONS — World Trade Center Building 7 is the red-tinted building behind and to the left of the Twin Towers.  While the most iconic images of that fateful day are the collapse of the twin towers World Trade Center 1 (WTC 1) and World Trade Center 2 (WTC 2) within moments of each other, following the fires started by a passenger airplane crashing into each of them, there is a third building most often cited as the smoking gun in the “controlled demolition” theory. This building, World Trade Center Building 7 (WTC 7) was not hit by any aircraft and yet it too imploded like a house of cards, says Korol and his co-authors and others note it housed CIA and Secret Service offices.  “Indeed, neither before nor since 9/11 have fires caused the total collapse of a steel-framed high-rise — nor has any other natural event, with the exception of the 1985 Mexico City earthquake, which toppled a 21-storey office building,” they argue. “Otherwise, the only phenomenon capable of collapsing such buildings completely has been by way of a procedure known as controlled demolition, whereby explosives or other devices are used to bring down a structure intentionally.”  Korol, who has taken contrarian positions on other engineering-related issues, says it’s important to keep challenging the status quo because we need to know how and why the buildings collapsed in order to prevent reoccurrences.  “The fires were on the upper floors, there’s little chance the heat would have spread down and caused the steel columns, or the connectors or floor beams, to sufficiently weaken and collapse in the twin towers,” he tells the Daily Commercial News.  “Also they were treated with a fire retardant which would have insulated them.”  Further, he says, when the structures did fail they did so with such explosive force that pulverized concrete was ejected at high velocity and scattered on a debris field some 370 meters away.  NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION/WIKIMEDIA COMMONS —  An aerial view of the remains of the collapsed World Trade Center (WTC) buildings on 9/11. The original footprints of the WTC Twin Towers 1 and 2 and Building 7 are outlined.  The most probable explanation is a controlled explosion and most likely using thermite, he says, adding in the case of WTC 7 some 67 percent of the supporting steel strength in Column 79 — pinpointed as the cause of the fatal collapse — would have to be lost before it failed and that would mean temperatures of 660C.  The paper also notes sprinkler systems would have reduced heat factors, while the overall design of the steel structure would isolate any failure and prevent a domino effect collapse.  The NIST however maintains the heat factor triggered an expansion in floor beams, pushing them off their seats and causing the collapse when other components also failed due to thermal expansion.  Korol and other like-minded colleagues, stubbornly disagree.”  Watch more here:  Source:  https://canada.constructconnect.com",SHOCKING VIDEO FOUND: George W.

147,28070735176737195652540407892504944071,"Twenty-seven active-duty U.S. Air Force pilots have resigned their commissions over the unconstitutionality of Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin’s mandate requiring all Armed Forces members to at once receive a Covid-19 vaccination, Real Raw News has learned.  The exodus began on August 27, with 12 pilots from the 1st Fighter Wing at Joint Base Langley-Eustis, Virginia, submitting to their commanding officer letters of resignation only hours after they received a 4:00 a.m. text message instructing them to submit to mandatory Covid-19 vaccinations by 10:00 a.m. that same day. It’s unknown whether the pilots collaborated ahead of resigning, but all 12 resignations were handed in within a 90-minute period.  One officer, a 29-year-old F-22 Raptor pilot, said of the situation, “We undergo routine physicals and must meet rigorous fitness standards to stay on flight duty. I think it’s safe to say all Air Force pilots are in good physical condition. We must be to endure extreme G-force stress on our body. There is no reason we should be at risk of Covid-19 or becoming sick from it. I know I’m not alone in rejecting this potentially dangerous and soundly untested shot.”  Pilots at other airbases apparently joined him in solidarity.  A day later, 15 pilots of the 2nd Bomb Wing in Barksdale, Louisiana tendered letters of resignation after they, too, received orders to get the jab. The orders stated explicitly that any officer refusing a Covid-19 vaccination would lose his flight status and be subject to disciplinary action, including a potential dishonorable discharge from the service.  A pilot with the 2nd Bomb Wing told RRN that he and his fellow pilots marched into their commanding officer’s office and dropped the resignation letters on his desk. He added that airmen and maintenance crews—enlisted persons who cannot simply resign from the service—are also furious about the mandatory vaccination requirement. Several of them, he told RRN, have sent hardship letters asking for early dismissal from the Air Force, mainly because they don’t have faith in a vaccine that has killed thousands of healthy people, military and civilians alike.  “This is only the beginning. A lot more of us will be turning in our wings,” he said.  RRN will provide additional details on this topic as it develops.

148,218269668526748655502263047268775987406,"Elements of the U.S. military working under JAG authority arrested Hunter Biden on Monday morning as he and two underage female companions tried to reenter the United States after deboarding a chartered flight that originated in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.  According to sources familiar with the arrest, U.S. Customs and Immigration Services detained Hunter Biden and friends moments after they had claimed baggage at Dulles International Airport in Washington, D.C.  Preliminary information suggests that a suitcase in Biden’s possession held several kilograms of “crack-cocaine” and that his two companions, based on passport information, were 13 and 14 years old.  Why or how Dubai authorities did not notice the drugs remains unknown; typically, baggage is x-rayed at the point of departure, not arrival, and it’s highly unusual for the TSA or Customs to detain passengers at baggage claim.  Nor is it immediately clear why Dubai allowed two underage females to accompany Hunter Biden on the flight.  Our source said that Customs alerted the military to Biden’s arrival, and that plain clothed Delta Force operators were at once dispatched to apprehend Biden before he had a chance to call his father or other Deep State associates.  Biden and his female colleagues were heavily intoxicated or stoned at the time of arrest, a military source told RRN. All three had bloodshot eyes, slurred speech, and could barely stand on their own two feet without aid.  “Do you know who my father is? You can’t do shit to me, motherfucker,” Hunter Biden purportedly told a Delta Force operator.  “Guess what? We don’t work for your father,” the operator replied.  Hunter Biden was separated from the females and taken to a holding facility at an unknown location.  RRN will provide additional details as they develop.

At West Point Military Academy, a number of cadets are currently rebelling against the push from the Biden administration and military higher-ups to take one of the controversial COVID-19 vaccines. 700 cadets who initially refused the vaccine were brought together into a meeting room, and were briefed as to the benefits of the vaccine. The number of cadets has now dwindled significantly after allegations of daily pressure by “senior officials” at the school, and rumors of reductions of leave. Some cadets relented and received the vaccine, while many left West Point due to the pressure.  Those who still refuse to take the vaccine are forced to wear masks everywhere, marking them out from everybody else who is vaccinated. A number of parents of those holdouts have now organized legal counsel on behalf of their children, with CDMedia reporting that they are “banding together to fight this perceived criminal behavior by those in power over their children.  ADVERTISEMENT  An anonymous whistleblower, whose identity National File is protecting, gave a breakdown of the current restrictions that West Point cadets who refuse to take the COVID vaccine have to face. For those cadets returning for summer programs, they will have their two week leave shortened to one, as they have to spend 7 days in a quarantine that amounts to serious solitary confinement. The cadets are locked up for 23 hours each day in one room, and are only allowed out for one hour to walk or run outside.  Crucially, these cadets are not tested for COVID-19 before they are put into self-isolation. In fact, they are only tested at the end of the period. If they test negative, they will be released to their training programs. In a letter sent to the cadets deemed “high risk,” there was no detail as to what would happen if the cadet tested positive instead, in terms of whether they would be forced to endure another week or more of the solitary confinement. National File contacted West Point for details on this program via phone and email, but did not receive a response by the time of publication.  ADVERTISEMENT  The new regime could not accurately be described as self-isolation or quarantine, as such programs already existed at West Point for cadets returning after the summer and Christmas breaks this academic year who tested positive. For those cadets, before the vaccination program kicked into high gear, they would be restricted at some points, but could also work out in the outside gyms, and leave their accommodation to go and order food, albeit being ordered to stay away from cadets who were not infected. These luxuries are not afforded to the cadets who refuse to take the vaccine, even though they may not have the virus.  West Point allegedly plans to round up all the cadets who are refusing the vaccine and transfer them into all one company or platoon based on how many they’re are. At the time of writing, around 50 cadets have not backed down. The whistleblower said this would likely be better for them, as they would not be around other troops who derogatorily shout at them, calling them “anti-vaxxers,” and instead would be with those who stand with them. “They’re being treated like criminals,” the whistleblower added. “They’re trying to protect other people’s rights and their rights are being compromised.”  National File reported last year on two successive suicides from the Colorado Springs Air Force, with students expressing to the academy that the deaths may have been linked to depression springing from the then extremely strict social distancing policies and punishments for violating the six-foot distance protocols. Following the deaths, looser restrictions were enacted.",EXCLUSIVE: Biden’s Military Puts West Point Cadets in Solitary Confinement If They Refuse COVID Vaccine,false
150,261076908714584999386249878156498941652,"On June 21 the Office of Military Commissions convicted former Attorney General William Barr on charges of treason, buttressing Donald J. Trump’s assertion that Deep State operatives had infiltrated nearly every crevice of his administration. Upon learning of Barr’s fate, Trump reportedly told his inner circle “Justice was served” and that Deep Staters masquerading as Republicans are not impervious to military justice.  Real Raw News can now report that Barr was taken into custody on May 21, when U.S. Marines operating under the guidance of the Insurrection Act arrested the traitor at his McClean, Virginia, home. He was promptly taken to Guantanamo Bay, where he lived in a 6X9’ cell while awaiting his tribunal date.  On Tuesday Barr had his day in court. In an opening statement, he said he had been fiercely loyal to Donald J. Trump prior to his ousting. He said he had helped craft many of the indictments on which the military was now acting, under the belief that Trump was interested in “draining the swamp.” But in November Barr had an epiphany; he told the tribunal that Trump had instructed him to author indictments on persons who had no ties to the political arena, and that it was his opinion that Trump’s indictments were designed to settle personal scores and vendettas, not to restore political integrity.  “President Trump subverted my trust and judicial authority. When he showed me a list of people to be indicted, I was shocked. I asked him why this or that person was being indicted, and he told me ‘Because they’re criminals, Bill.’ When I asked for proof, he told me ‘Don’t worry, Bill, we’ll find the proof.’ I refused to participate any further in his witch hunt, and that’s why I tendered my resignation on 23 December,” Barr addressed the tribunal.  His explanation didn’t seem to impress Rear Adm. Darse E. Crandall, who had successfully prosecuted the military’s case against John Podesta.  “An interesting, largely fictional telling of what happened. Let’s be honest with each other here, Mr. Barr. You were given an opportunity to resign—to save face. Not that it mattered because, unbeknownst to you, you were already under scrutiny. If you had moral and ethical issues with the indictments back in April, May, June, July, August, September, October, and November, why would you wait until Dec 23 to resign? That doesn’t make much sense,” Rear Adm. Crandall said.  Barr countered that he wanted to give Trump every chance to realize he had taken a precipitous turn toward the dark side and to return to the light.  “I tried to help him,” Barr said.  “The truth is exactly the opposite, isn’t it, Mr. Barr. Trump kept you around because he keeps his friends close and his enemies closer, and he gave you every opportunity to amend your mistakes. Then you stabbed him in the back by denying election fraud and supporting a fraudulent president. And certainly you understand that bribery, especially for an appointed official, is akin to treason,” Rear Adm. Crandall said.  He showed the panel incontrovertible proof of Barr’s criminal maleficence—financial documents proving the Barrs—William and Christine—had received a $7,000,000 “donation” deposited into a 501C3 titled “Conservative Truth Initiative.” The depositor, a Chinese national with indisputable ties to the DNC, spread the funds across several bank accounts. The deposits had hit the Barrs’ accounts on 2 December, one day after Barr excoriated Trump on national television.  “I submit to you,” Rear Adm. Crandall told the three-officer tribunal, “that William Barr did knowingly collaborate with the enemy to undermine and delegitimize the democratically elected President of the United States, Donald J. Trump, and in doing so betrayed his oath to the U.S. Constitution. Simply put, treason.”  “What I did was take action to protect the United States. If I had to, I’d do it again. I’d do it five times over,” Barr said.  Fifteen minutes later, the panel found Barr guilty of treason, seditious conspiracy, advocating overthrow of government, recruiting for the service against the United States, and enlistment to serve against the United States, and decreed that he be executed for his crimes in accordance with U.S.C. Title 18 and provisions specified in the Insurrection Act of 1807.  Rear Adm. Darse has scheduled Barr’s hanging for August 2.

152,144243934266366015992482948123848406077,"William Jefferson Clinton’s military tribunal at Guantanamo Bay began on Friday, following a three-day delay caused by a female panelist whose amorous display of affection toward the former president shocked the Office of Military Commissions.  The joviality and swagger Clinton displayed on Monday had evaporated when uniformed MPs escorted him to GITMO’s south courtroom Friday morning. A much more sullen and forlorn Bill Clinton, head hung low, was seated at the defense table beside the advocate he had chosen to represent him, the venerable David E. Kendall.  Kendall is an American attorney, a graduate of Wabash College, Yale Law School, and Worcester College, Oxford, who clerked with Supreme Court Justice Byron White, worked as associate counsel at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, and has been a partner at Williams & Connolly LLP of Washington, DC since 1981, where he has provided legal counsel to individuals and corporations on high-profile business and political matters. He represented Clinton during the 1998-1999 impeachment proceedings stemming from Clinton’s relations with White House intern Monica Lewinski.  At the start of Friday’s proceedings, Kendall boldly asked Rear Adm. John G. Hannink to “dismiss without prejudice” all charges leveled against Bill Clinton. Those charges include murder, sex crimes against minors, treason, theft of government property,  “President Clinton should not have to answer for the crimes of Hillary Rodham Clinton, who has already been sentenced and put to death. For many years, William Jefferson Clinton was largely oblivious to his wife’s transgressions, and once he became aware of them, he had only a peripheral involvement, at best. Make no mistake, she called all the shots. My client was along for the ride,” Kendall said.  “It was all Hillary,” Bill Clinton said.  But Vice Adm. Hannink was unimpressed at Clinton’s refusal to take accountability for his misdeeds. Paraphrasing author Peter Schweizer’s observation in the book Clinton Cash, Vice Adm. Hannink noted that “the couple that steals together, stays together,” and expounded on that theory by telling the tribunal that “apparently, the couple that kills together, stays together too.”  “And there is no statute of limitations on murder, not even for you, detainee Clinton,” Vice Adm. Hannink said.  “My client never killed anyone,” Kendall interjected.  His statement prompted Vice Adm. Hannink to play a taped telephone call for the tribunal. It was a 1993 conversation between Bill Clinton, then-Attorney General Janet Reno, then-ATF chief David Chipman, and former FBI director William Sessions. The call, recorded on day 50 of the Waco standoff between Branch Davidian leader David Koresh and U.S. alphabet agencies, underpinned Clinton’s mounting hatred of not only Koresh but also the women and children sheltered within the compound. Reno, Chipman, and Sessions urged Clinton to swiftly resolve the protracted stalemate, arguing that his indecisiveness would empower future “domestic terrorists” and religious zealots to follow in Koresh’s footsteps. Reno pleaded with Clinton to “burn them out,” and both Chipman and Sessions, after expressing mild trepidations, agreed the situation had become untenable. Clinton gave them “carte blanche,” and encouraged them to eliminate “malcontents” as long as blame was assigned to Koresh and the U.S. government was held harmless for any fatalities.  “I don’t care what happens to them, they didn’t vote for me anyway,” Clinton said on the call. “If they die, they die. Just make sure the finger can’t be pointed back at us, or more importantly, me. Let’s nip this in the bud right now.”  As most know, on day 51 the FBI and ATF launched a siege on the Branch Davidian Compound. A fire consumed the facility, and 76 Branch Davidians, including Koresh, 25 children, and two pregnant women, were reduced to ashes. Janet Reno later claimed that Koresh had burned out his own people, even though video footage of government vehicles and personnel equipped with flamethrowers and other incendiary devices surfaced in pictures and video.  On a recorded telephone call captured three days after the siege, Clinton congratulated Reno, saying the Branch Davidians “got what they deserved.”  In GITMO’s south courtroom, Vice Adm. Hannink replayed the recording several times.  “This was not Hillary; this was all you. You were president, not your wife. Nowhere is she heard on these calls. No one here is saying Koresh was a nice guy. But you, detainee Clinton, ordered those deaths,” Vice Adm. Hannink said.  Kendall objected, claiming the tapes had not been entered into discovery and, thus, he had been given no opportunity to rebut their validity.  “I understand you were an accomplished civilian litigator, Mr. Kendall, but this is a military commission, operating under full force and effect of the insurrection act,” Vice Adm. Hannink replied.  Kendall altered his tone and calmly requested a 72-hour continuance, until Monday morning, to allow him to authenticate the tapes.  “Very well, this commission will grant you your 72 hours, but we’ll tolerate no further delays after this,” Vice Adm. Hannink said.  He put the tribunal in recess until ten hundred hours Monday morning.  (Visited 149,474 times, 8 visits today)",Bill Clinton Military Tribunal: Day 1,false

The confidentially agreement which can be viewed here states that providers ‘Moderna’ alongside the ‘National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases’ (NIAID) agreed to tranfer ‘mRNA coronavirus vaccine candidates’ developed and jointly-owned by NIAID and Moderna to recipients ‘The Universisty of North Carolina at Chapel Hill’ on the 12th December 2019.

Recipient signatories found on page 107  The agreement was also signed by two representatives of the NIAID, one of whom was Amy F. Petrik PhD, a technology transfer specialist who signed the agreement on December 12th 2019 at 8:05 am. The other signatory was Barney Graham MD PhD, an investigator for the NIAID, however this signature was not dated.  NIAID signatories found on page 107  The final signatories on the agreement were Sunny Himansu, Moderna’s Investigator, and Shaun Ryan, Moderna’s Deputy General Councel. Both signautres were made on December 17th 2019.  Moderna signatories found on page 108  All of these signatures were made prior to any knowledge of the alleged emergence of the novel coronavirus. It wasn’t until December 31st 2019 that the World Health Organisation (WHO) became aware of an alleged cluster of viral pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China. But even at this point they had not determined that an alleged new coronavirus was to blame, instead stating the pneumonia was of “unknown cause”.  It was not until January 9th 2020 that the WHO reported Chinese authorities had determined the outbreak was due to a novel coronavirus which later became known as SARS-CoV-2 with the alleged resultant disease dubbed COVID-19. So why was an mRNA coronavirus vaccine candidate developed by Moderna being transferred to the University of North Carolina on December 12th 2019?  The same Moderna that have had an mRNA coronavirus vaccine authorised for emergency use only in both the United Kingdom and United States to allegedly combat Covid-19.  What did Moderna know that we didn’t? In 2019 there was not any singular coronavirus posing a threat to humanity which would warrant a vaccine, and evidence suggests there hasn’t been a singular coronavirus posing a threat to humanity throughout 2020 and 2021 either.  Considering the fact a faulty PCR test has been used at a high cycle rate, hospitals have been empty in comparison to previous years, statistics show just 0.2% of those allegedly infected have died within 28 days of an alleged positive test result, the majority of those deaths by a mile have been people over the age of 85, and a mass of those deaths were caused by a drug called midazolam, which causes respiratory depression, and respiratory arrest.

On Monday, June 7, Brennan shared Hillary Clinton’s macabre fate—death by hanging after a military tribunal convicted him of murder and treason. Unlike Clinton, who remained steadfastly silent until the very moment the noose was slipped around her neck, a loudmouthed Brennan cussed out the guards who offered him a last meal, which he declined, berated his MP escort to gallows, and rebuked the small assembly of military and civilian personnel who had gathered near the Windward Point Lighthouse to witness his death.  In fact, Brennan had scarcely shut his mouth in the weeks between conviction and execution, said a GITMO source speaking on condition of anonymity. He told Real Raw News that Brennan availed himself of every opportunity to express contempt at the U.S. military and the citizenry. Brennan spent much of his incarceration deriding Donald J. Trump, calling him society’s great mistake and a threat to national security. He said Trump ought to have been “aborted.”  His swaggering bravado, however, did not stop GITMO staff from escorting him to gallows early that morning. At precisely 8:00 a.m., he climbed atop the same apparatus that was used to execute Hillary Clinton less than two months prior. Shackled at the wrists and bound at the ankles, he stood on the trap door that would swing open beneath his feet when Vice Adm. John G. Hannink ordered the 5-man execution detail to push the circular red buttons affixed to the lattice framework.  Vice Adm. Hannink reminded the detail to press the buttons in synchronicity, after, and only after, he issued the ‘execute’ command. Only one button would trigger the ghoulish device, and no soldier would ever know if his button ended Brennan’s life.  “Your all pussies and cowards, especially you, Adm. Hannink. I don’t see the three cowardly officers who passed sentence on me here, either. Where are they? No stomach. Where’s Trump? I figured he ain’t got the testicular fortitude to watch his handiwork in action. He’s a fucking pussy, and you’re all cowards and liars for following him. Let’s get this over with. I ain’t scared of shit,” Brennan said, as an MP slipped the noose around his neck.  Vice Adm. Hannink approached the gallows and tilted his head to meet Brennan’s menacing stare.  “This is not about Donald J. Trump. This is about you and the actions you’ve taken in the name of evil. Trump just had the guts to get the ball rolling, but one way or another, with or without Trump, your fate was sealed the moment you participated in the murders of innocent civilians. Trump may have been the catalyst, but you’re here because, frankly, you’re one evil sonofabitch,” Vice Adm. Hannink said.  “Do your master’s bidding; I’ll see you and Trump in hell,” Brennan retorted.  The ‘execute’ command was given, and the door beneath Brennan’s feet swung downward. His neck snapped, and the rope was cut. Brennan’s lifeless body lie motionless on a patch of grass. A military physician felt for a pulse and declared Brennan dead.  “Today justice has been served,” Vice Adm. Hannink said to the assembly.  Brennan’s death, the latest Deep State casualty, was heralded as a moment of triumph among upper echelon brass involved in the Deep State purge.

The females, RRN has learned, had cellophane-wrapped packets of cocaine strapped to their torsos, and Hunter Biden’s suitcase held 3kg of crack-cocaine. RRN cannot explain why customs in Dubai did not spot the contraband before they boarded the flight.  RRN has learned that the U.S. military conducted a simultaneous raid on Biden’s posh Venice, CA mansion, which he reportedly leases from Sweetgreen Co-founder Johnathon Neman at the cost of $25,000 per month.  A source at the Office of Military Commissions told RRN that Special Forces stormed the lavish estate within minutes of Biden’s apprehension at Dulles. The Rapid Deployment Teams, our source added, had standing orders to arrest Biden when he was least protected and to search his home for evidence of drug and child trafficking, and child pornography.  Upon entering the residence, Special Forces met resistance in the form of two Secret Service agents who had been assigned to guard the home. The Secret Service, like the intelligence agencies and rogue military commanders, have sided with Biden and the Deep State rather than devote its resources toward protecting American freedoms. The agents drew weapons and tried to repel Special Forces, but both Secret Service agents were killed in a brief but explosive firefight. Neither Biden’s wife, Melissa Cohen, nor his children were home at the time of the raid, our source said.  Special Forces seized 6 laptops, 2 desktop computers and five cellular phones from the residence. They also found a disguise kit, which Hunter had apparently used to alter his appearance, and 7 passports in 7 different names.  In a closet they found and confiscated 400 grams of crystal meth and 150 Ecstasy tablets, the latter being a popular party drug, as well as a shoebox of drug paraphernalia.  “The drugs weren’t hidden; the computers were in the open. It’s like Hunter really didn’t care if anyone came by and just saw this stuff sitting around his house. I’m sure that’s because he felt protected, that his father would always be there to protect him. The data on the electronic devices is currently being analyzed by military cybersecurity specialists. We hope to have the results soon,” our source said.  Meanwhile, Hunter Biden has been taken to a holding facility in an undisclosed location until he’s transported to Guantanamo Bay.

157,129001368288934163726698146308431990346,"Traitor. Murderer. Pedophile. Luciferian. Clinton co-conspirator. John Podesta was the embodiment of evil—“was” being the operative word. On Tuesday morning at precisely 8:00 a.m. GITMO time, a military firing squad composed of Marine volunteers gave Podesta a 6-gun salute—center mass.  Two hours earlier, military police had awoken Podesta and asked whether he wanted a final meal. A tearful and trembling Podesta reportedly refused a last repast, saying he had no appetite while whining about how Donald J. Trump and the U.S. military had convicted an innocent man.  Shackled at the wrists and ankles, Podesta was placed in a Humvee and driven to a clearing a kilometer southeast of Marine Hill, home to the fictional Lt. Col. Nathan R. Jessup in the film A Few Good Men.  The clearing was featureless except for freshly trimmed grass and a cement wall that measured 6’x6x2’. A small group of both military and civilian onlookers watched as two MPs removed Podesta from the Humvee and escorted him to the cement barricade, demanding he stand motionless before it.  The most recognizable attendees were Rear Adm. Crandall, who prosecuted the military’s case against Podesta, and, surprisingly, Marine Corps General David H. Berger, who recently assumed the role of Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff after unseating Gen. Mark A. Milley, who now stands accused of treason.  Six marines, rifles at their side, faced the barricade—and Podesta–at 20 yards.  “If the condemned has any last words, or wants Last Rites, now’s the time,” Rear Adm. Crandall said.  “I don’t want to die. I didn’t do anything. This is an aberrant violation of due process. I don’t want to die alone like this,” Podesta said.  General Berger spoke up: “You needn’t worry about dying alone. Hillary’s waiting for you, wherever you’re headed, and we’ll be sending plenty more company your way.”  Asked whether he wished to be blindfolded, Podesta said, “Does it matter?”  Rear Adm. Crandall addressed the firing squad: “When I give the command to fire, you’re to fire your rifles simultaneously, center mass. The magazines on your rifles hold only one round each. You will chamber that round on the ‘ready’ command. One cartridge holds a blank. If any of you soldiers feel guilty afterward, just convince yourself that it was your rifle that fired the blank. Remember, you volunteered for this duty.”  He gave the ‘ready’ command, and the Marines raised their rifles and chambered their single round of ammunition.  “Aim,” Rear Adm. Crandall said.  The Marines drew a bead on Podesta’s chest.  Podesta called out to God.  “Fire!” Rear Adm. Crandall ordered.  At once the six Marines discharged their weapons, and Podesta’s perforated body slumped forward and collapsed to the ground. A physician present felt for a pulse and placed a stethoscope to Podesta’s blood-stained chest, then declared him dead.  (Visited 256,021 times, 35 visits today)",John Podesta Executed at GITMO,false

Furthermore, the institute is against offering the vaccine on a voluntary basis, which has been proposed both in Norway and fellow Scandinavian nations.  “We believe that such an alternative may appear unethical and with a high risk that those who make such a choice have not fully understood the risk to which they are exposed,” the institute said.  The FHI also ventured that recommending the AstraZeneca vaccine for further use could lead to lower confidence among the population in vaccination programmes in general.  “This could lead to a lower vaccination rate and vaccination rate in the long run, and that patients in risk groups will also say no to vaccines.”  A recent survey by the FHI in collaboration with Mindshare and Norstat, indicated that 76 percent of the respondents were sceptical of at least one of the vaccines, even though 82 percent were initially positive about getting vaccinated. Of the vaccines, AstraZeneca gained the highest level of scepticism at 99 percent, compared with Moderna (9 percent) and Pfizer (8 percent).  However, the government believes it is too early to discontinue the vaccine completely, and is instead launching a new expert group to further investigate both AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson, which triggered similar concerns.  Pending a final decision, however, Norway has decided to distribute its stock of AstraZeneca to fellow Nordic countries that actually want to use them.  Of the Norwegian stock, Sweden will borrow 200,000, while 16,000 will go to Iceland.  “If the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine is resumed, we will get back the doses we lend as soon as we request it. Sweden and Iceland will then send back the doses from their first deliveries from AstraZeneca,” Health Minister Bent Høie said, as quoted by Verdens Gang.  The Swedish Public Health Agency has made a different assessment of the AstraZeneca vaccine and has concluded that the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks and the side effects.  The agency's Swedish equivalent, the Swedish Public Health Agency, has, however, made a completely different assessment and believes that the benefits of the vaccine far outweigh the risk of side effects.  State epidemiologist Anders Tegnell described the contentious vaccine as having a “high protective effect” and “reducing the risk of serious illness and death, especially among the elderly and weak”.  Earlier this spring, dozens of countries temporarily stopped the use of the AstraZeneca shot amid reports of side effects. Of them, many, like Sweden, have since resumed inoculation, citing a precarious infection situation and shortages of other vaccines.",Norway: Risk of Dying From AstraZeneca Higher Than of COVID-19,false

The claim that there is no evidence trans girls perform better in sports better than cisgender girls was put forward by Dr Veronica Ivy, a doctor of philosophy. There has been no peer-reviewed study to support the claim.  Ivy’s claim that the data that’s currently available doesn’t actually show that transgender girls have the upper hand when it comes to performing in sports alongside cisgender girls was not supported by any evidence.  Advert 10  Ted Eytan/ABC News  A doctor of philosophy has said that there’s no evidence that transgender girls perform better in sports than their cisgender peers.  Dr. Veronica Ivy said that the data that’s currently available doesn’t actually show that transgender girls have the upper hand when it comes to performing in sports alongside cisgender girls.  She added that until there’s data proving this, transgender girls should be allowed to compete with cisgender girls.  Advert 10  TMZ  However, Dr. Ivy – who has a PhD in philosophy but who is not a medical doctor – did acknowledge that there is a difference in performance between biologically-born boys and girls in the world of sports, but the reason for this is still speculated. It’s believed it could be biological, sociological or a combination of both, TMZ reports.  Addressing whether it’s testosterone in men that makes them perform better, Dr. Ivy said on TMZ Live:  The truth is, we don’t know [what makes men better at sports compared to women]. But we do know now, finally, after all these years, that it isn’t as simple as natural testosterone. That is not the reason. There are elite world championship level men with natural testosterone below the women’s average, and they’re competing at no disadvantage to men with 100 times as much testosterone. So there are certainly, maybe, some biological reasons for men, on average, being bigger, stronger, faster than women, but we do know that there are also social reasons.  Advert 10  PA Images  Dr. Ivy went on to describe competition in sports as a ‘human right’, and the ongoing issues transgender people are facing in the sports world is because people continue to compare men to women and girls to boys, instead of transgender women to cisgender women, and so on.  She said, ‘If we’re talking about trans girls in girl’s sport, then we have to talk about the difference between trans girls and cisgender girls – not boys and girls.’  Dr. Ivy’s comments come after several US states banned transgender girls from competing in girl’s sports out of concerns that they have an unfair advantage. These rules have been implemented in states such as Mississippi, Tennessee and Kansas.  Advert 10  PA Images  It also comes after Caitlyn Jenner said that biologically-born boys shouldn’t be able to compete in girl’s sports. She said, ‘This is a question of fairness. That’s why I oppose biological boys who are trans competing in girls’ sports in school. It just isn’t fair. And we have to protect girls’ sports in our schools.’  She’s since received criticism for her comments as many expected her, as a trans woman herself, to be more supportive.","CORRECTION: No Evidence Trans Girls Perform Better In Sports Than Cisgender Girls, Says Doctor",false

Hillary Rodham Clinton was hanged at Guantanamo Bay Monday night, her death the culmination of an operation that began on March 2 when U.S. Navy SEALs on Donald J. Trump’s authority arrested the disgraced politician at her Chappaqua, NY mansion. After a five-day tribunal at the world’s most infamous detention center, a three-officer panel found Clinton guilty of murder, accessory to murder, treason, child trafficking, and other high crimes. Clinton, who had refused counsel, had uttered nary a word throughout the proceedings, and had taken Vice Adm. John G. Hannink’s sentence of death with an unflinching gaze.  The hanging took place at 9:05 p.m., at once after Taps, which marks the start of quiet hours on U.S. military bases across the globe.  “The world is about to sleep quieter tonight,” Vice Adm. John G. Hannink said to a small assembly that included 3 Joint Chiefs of Staff and, notably, Donald J. Trump, who, garbed in his typical dark suit and crimson tie, had arrived at GITMO earlier in the day. Michael Pompeo and former NYC Mayor Rudy Giuliani flanked him, both men having played an integral role in amassing evidence against Clinton.  Under military guard, a shackled Hillary Clinton was escorted from Camp Delta detention block to gallows made of steel latticework, with a downward swinging door beneath her feet, that the Army Corps of Engineers had erected in a clearing near Windward Point Lighthouse, on GITMO’s southern edge. Affixed to a steel beam was a rectangular box with five circular, red buttons protruding from the case. In front of each button stood a uniformed soldier. Atop the platform, another soldier slipped a braided noose around Clinton’s neck.  Vice Adm. Hannink addressed the execution detail: “When I say ready, and not one moment before, you will poise your left index finger in front of the button. You will keep it hovered there until I say execute, and then you five must simultaneously press your button. Only one of the five buttons will trigger the door, and none of you will ever know which button that was. Do you understand these instructions?”  “Yes, sir,” the five bellowed in unison.  A chaplain and a physician climbed the 13 steps leading to the top of the platform and stood beside a soldier who was checking to ensure the noose was secure around Clinton’s neck. Below them, Vice Adm. Hannink asked if Clinton wanted last rites or had any final words.  Clinton broke silence. “I’m Hillary Clinton, you can’t do this to me,” she said, her voice a witch’s cackle.  “It’s already done,” Donald J. Trump shouted up at her.  “Ready.” Vice Adm. Hannink nodded at the execution detail.  After a moment’s pause, he gave the “execute” order, the soldiers pressed their buttons, and the grate beneath Clinton’s feet swung open. Her legs and feet, still shackled at the ankles, twitched a moment or two, then stopped.  The rope was cut, and Clinton’s lifeless body lie sprawled in a damp patch of grass. The physician present checked her vitals and declared her dead.  A confidential source involved in Trump’s mission to obliterate the Deep State said the overall mood was somber and melancholy; there was no celebration, no jubilation, just an atmosphere of contentedness, an acknowledgement that what had to be done, was done. The nature of her crimes overshadowed celebratory thought. But a four-decade reign of terror had come to an end.  “As much as Trump hated her, this was purely business. He cares about the children who suffered at her hands more than he cares about what she did to him. Yes, her demise sends a signal to the Deep State. But Trump knows there are many more to go, and he won’t celebrate till the job is done,” our source said.  (Visited 956,678 times, 55 visits today)",Hillary Clinton Hanged at GITMO,false
161,39310041483877003275003860085912868357,"President Joe Biden handed the border crisis off to Kamala Harris so that she could get a handle on the humanitarian catastrophe the Biden administration created.  So, since she has been placed in charge of the problems created by the surge of Unregistered Democrats illegally crossing our southern border, Harris has yet to visit ground zero to get a look-see at the administration’s handiwork. Remember when Harris laughed at questions asked by reporters on when she was going to visit the border? “Not today, HAHAHAHAHA!” #EyeRoll  Harris may not have made it to the border yet but her book has already made it there to be dropped into welcome bags that are given out to unaccompanied illegal border crossing migrant children at a Long Beach, California shelter where they are being held.  “Superheroes Are Everywhere” was published in January 2018. Harris wrote the book, a picture book that currently sells on Amazon for $11.85. It is recommended for children 3–7 years old. The book was seen inside welcome bags that were packed up for unaccompanied minors as they arrive at the Long Beach Convention & Entertainment Center along with basic hygiene supplies and clothing.  You have to wonder how this happened because things like a person’s book being placed into a welcome bag for illegal aliens isn’t just a coincidence.  The White House played dumb – and unfortunately for them, no one knew the difference – when a White House official said the administration was not aware that the book was being distributed. The official then blamed it on local volunteers. The official told Fox News that local communities usually put together welcome bags for illegal migrants, and the White House is using that in hopes that the blame for the story goes to the volunteers at the Long Beach facility, which makes sense because Democrats never take responsibility for anything. Remember, just a couple of weeks ago they were still saying there is no crisis at the border?  It doesn’t really matter who did it. The point is doing it is an ethical violation and I believe illegal as well. Remember when Harris and Biden said the administration was going to be the most transparent in history? Yeah, whatevs.  Remember when liberals went nuts after Kellyanne Conway promoted Ivanka Trump’s brand? She was a senior advisor to the president. Kamala is Vice President of the United States!  On Friday, Harris actually did travel to a border state, but I don’t think New Hampshire counts because the Biden administration hasn’t yet created a crisis on our northern border. But then, it is still early. Harris has traveled back to her home state of California, but she was spotted nowhere near the southern border. She wasn’t spotted near the borders in Arizona, New Mexico, or Texas either.  This news means at least 1,000 of Harris’ books were purchased because that’s it can house how many illegal alien children at the facility in Long Beach. Normally, Democrats make their fortune by writing a book that the unions spend millions purchasing as payback for policies and programs Democrats passed that exclusively help unions. They then either donate to libraries around the country or use them in their fireplace.  What will the kids use the book for? They can’t read it as it is written in English. In what way is Kamala Harris’ children’s book useful to Spanish-speaking illegal alien children?  At $11.85 a pop, for 1,000 illegal children, that comes to $11,850. Who paid for that? Did you and I pay for it out of our tax dollars? If so, then Kamala Harris made good money on a scam giving these illegal alien kids her book. It’s important to find out who paid for the books because if this administration gets away with personally enriching the VP like this at this early stage of the administration, there’s no telling what kind of money-making schemes they’ll do in the near future. Hunter Biden may be tasked to sell Kamala’s book over in China for all we know.  VIDEO OF THE DAY Idiots Twerk On Ambulance After Shooting In Oakland, CA    And the same raging liberals who thought Donald Trump gave away free rooms in his hotels to foreign diplomats as a bribe won’t care one way or the other about Harris’ book scandal.

163,250413130058349215829781715212948375970,"Last month Real Raw News reported on a shocking incident at the Pentagon, the seat of America’s military might: The man who calls himself president, Joseph R. Biden, had visited the Pentagon under the pretense of conducting a surprise presidential inspection. His real impetus was to learn whether a rumor he had heard was true, that Donald J. Trump was in the building meeting secretly with Marine Corps General David H. Berger, which could explain why Pentagon police denied him access to the property. While RRN cannot confirm Trump’s presence, we can now authenticate earlier reports that pointed to a dramatic shift in power at the nation’s most fortified structure.  On April 14, two days before the Pentagon Protection Force turned away a shocked and confused Biden, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark A. Milley summoned the 7 other Joint Chiefs to the Pentagon for an emergency meeting, according to a confidential source involved in Trump’s mission to eliminate Deep State operatives throughout the nation.  Gen. Milley, our source said, lambasted his colleagues for allowing high-ranking officers from all branches of the U.S. Armed Forces to undermine Biden’s presidency. Gen. Milley said Biden was the democratically elected President of the United States, and that all armed forces personnel, from the lowest private to the highest general, had a patriotic duty to support and protect Democracy, Joseph Biden, and Kamala Harris.  “From what we know, he went off, ballistic-like. He was a cursing machine, swearing at and excoriating these highly decorated, lifelong members of our country’s military. He said he’d heard they were helping Trump do what he called ‘secret and illegal arrests’ of prominent active and retired politicians. He kept blasting them and told them he was going to recommend that Biden and Harris fire them,” our source said.  Gen. Milley reportedly offered the other Joint Chiefs of Staff a final chance to abandon their allegiance to Donald J. Trump and swear fealty to Joseph R. Biden and Kamala Harris.  Of all the Chiefs, only one leapt to his feet in support of Biden. Gen. Daniel R. Hokanson, Chief of the National Guard Bureau, denounced Donald Trump and told Gen. Milley that he and the National Guard would honor their oath to the Constitution He said they were prepared to defend Biden’s presidency with their lives, if necessary.  Our source said Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps David H. Berger, a longtime supporter of Donald Trump, passed Gen. Milley an envelope. The envelope held an arrest warrant issued by the U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General’s Corps. It named Gen. Milley as a traitor to America and its people.  “Except for you and this coward,” Gen. Berger said, pointing at Gen. Hokanson, “we all support this great nation and what it stands for, and we reject the forces of darkness destroying what our Founding Fathers worked so hard to codify. We stand for a nation, not a man. Why are you so eager to say Kamala Harris’s name in every sentence with Biden’s name? We know why.”  Gen. Milley, our source added, shredded the warrant, calling it a joke, and promised Gen. Berger he would hang for treasonous behavior.  “If anyone hangs, it won’t be me,” Gen. Berger reportedly said. “We’ve been expecting this for a long time.”  A dozen armed members of the Pentagon Protection Force entered the conference room and handcuffed Generals Milley and Hokanson.  In closing, our source said Milley and Hokanson have since been shipped to Guantanamo Bay, where they will ultimately answer to a military tribunal.  Asked if Donald J. Trump was at the Pentagon on April 16, our source replied: “I cannot say yes or not. I can tell that what’s happening now is a prelude to his reinauguration on Independence Day.”  (Visited 214,730 times, 28 visits today)",Pentagon Coup! Joint Chiefs Overthrown,false
164,37165697376437806696576651574029019912,"UPDATE: CLINTON HANGED AT GITMO  A military tribunal on Thursday convicted former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on charges of murder, conspiracy to commit murder, accessory to murder, child trafficking, endangering a minor, treason, and sedition.  The two male, one female panel of officers cast a unanimous verdict shortly after Vice Adm. John G. Hannink, who prosecuted the military’s case against Clinton, showcased his final witness for the prosecution, Clinton’s former strategist and lover, Huma Abedin.  In exchange for leniency and a plea deal, Abedin testified she and Clinton had “shared” underage children with her estranged ex-husband, Anthony Weiner. Pressed to clarify her definition of the word “shared,” Abedin qualified her answer by saying they had “practiced” lewd and lascivious behavior on underprivileged minors Clinton had imported into the United States.  “American children?” Vice Adm. Hannink asked.  “Yes, but not primarily. They’re too easy to track. More often than not from poor countries,” Abedin replied.  “Would you tell this tribunal how you appropriated these children?” Vice Adm. Hannink asked.  “Hillary used her government credentials. She had carte blanche, as a Secretary of State, former Secretary of State and former First Lady. It was easy for her to bring orphaned children in from places like, say, Syria, Afghanistan, or Iraq. No one asked questions. No one to look for them,” Abedin replied callously.  Asked to quantify their exploits, Abedin said she couldn’t count the number of underage boys and girls Clinton had brought to the United States under the pretense of providing them with a fruitful life, but she told the tribunal there had been “many,” most of whom were later “sold or donated” to influential members of the Clinton cabal.  “Who are the people?” Vice Adm. Hannink asked.  “We never knew, exactly. It’s not like Hillary peddled them herself. She had someone handle that, and I don’t know the person’s name,” Abedin replied.  “And yet she still refuses to speak,” Vice Adm. Hannink observed.  He asked the tribunal whether they had heard enough; that the military had presented overwhelming evidence of Clinton’s atrocities against the United States and humankind. Unlike a conventional criminal trial, he reminded the commission, a unanimous verdict was not needed to convict Clinton on any of the charges. A majority vote, he said, would satisfy justice.  The tribunal arrived at a guilty verdict after deliberating only five minutes. They found Clinton guilty on all charges the military had laid out—the murders of Seth Rich, Vince Foster, and Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia; trafficking and abusing minors from Haiti and other third-world nations; conspiring to assassinate a presidential candidate.  As she had throughout the tribunal, Clinton stayed eerily silent as the verdict was read and the officers recommended she receive the death penalty for her crimes. Vice Adm. Hannink asked Clinton if she had preference in how the military carried out her sentence, but still she refused to speak.  “You refused counsel. You refused to defend yourself. This tribunal therefore decides that the defendant, detainee Hillary Rodham Clinton, be hanged by the neck until dead,” Vice Adm. Hannink said flatly. “The sentence will be carried out on April 26, after Taps.”  Huma Abedin will face her own military tribunal, at a date yet to be decided, RRN has learned.

Shortly after meeting Democratic lawmakers to discuss more restrictive gun-control legislation, Biden went to Arlington, VA to advocate the merits of his planned withdrawal of all U.S. Armed Forces from Afghanistan. He had also sought to convince military leaders that Iran’s decision to enrich weapons-grade plutonium to 60% did not threaten U.S. interests, said an administration source speaking under condition of anonymity.  But Biden never made it inside.  Our source said U.S. Pentagon Police, part of the Pentagon Force Protection Agency, stopped Biden and his Secret Service detail in their tracks, informing them that they had standing orders to prevent Biden administration members–including Biden–from entering the building. Those orders reportedly included the use of deadly force.  “Biden demanded to know who gave the order, stumbling through his words, and was told the directive came directly from Gen. David H. Berger, Commandant of the United States Marine Corps and a ranking member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. When Biden demanded to speak with Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley, he was told Milley—a Biden supporter—was no longer in charge,” our source said.  Biden, our source added, became belligerent, saying as the President of the United States he had unrestricted access to all federal properties, including the Pentagon. He then instructed his three-man SS detail to “resolve the issue.”  Pentagon police drew sidearms, our source said.  “The Pentagon Protection Force told the SS agents they’d be making a mistake. That there were over a hundred inside ready to back them up if trouble started. The SS didn’t want any part of that and told Biden he’d have to force his way in himself, if he was so inclined,” our source said.  Moreover, Biden purportedly muttered an unbelievable phrase: “I bet that bastard is inside.”  We can only guess as to whom he was referring, but RRN guesses he meant none other Donald J. Trump. While it seems unlikely, we must remember that Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley opposed Trump’s presidency and was one of few high-ranking military leaders who supported Biden’s alleged 2020 victory. It is possible that Gen. Milley has been overthrown, and Marine Corps Gen. David Berger has assumed command of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  RRN will provide updates as they become available.

Lynch committed at least two 4-man squads to the mission, said a confidential source involved in Trump’s quest to depose Joseph Biden and restore America to the people.  On Tuesday at about 3:00 a.m., U.S. Marines operating on Donald Trump’s authority stormed Comey’s seven-bedroom, 10,700-sqaure-foot mansion in McClean, Virginia. Although most operational details are classified, our source said Raiders surprised Comey, who was half-asleep in bed, and apprehended him after he reached for a pistol underneath a pillow. Before he could palm the weapon, a Marine charged forward and struck Comey’s forehead with the butt of his rifle, rendering Comey unconscious.  “Trump’s people had digital surveillance on the Comey residence for quite a long time. They knew Comey’s wife, Patrice, would be out of town on personal business, and none of the kids would be around visiting. Trump’s been anticipating this moment a long time; it’s a day of reckoning,” our source said.  Trump, our source added, had authored a sealed indictment on Comey shortly after firing him on May 9, 2017. He had obtained irrefutable evidence proving that Comey, an Obama holdover, had been on Clinton’s payroll and, on her authority, tried to slander the president by linking the Trump campaign to Russian interference in the 2016 election. Moreover, Trump had obtained a 2015 audio recording in which Comey told Hillary Clinton he would “do whatever it takes, no matter what” to scuttle Trump’s bid for the presidency. Additionally, Trump learned that Comey’s faux investigation into Clinton’s handling of confidential emails was merely for effect, optics to avoid the appearance of impropriety and bias.  “Comey is criminal scum. He doesn’t have a modicum of decency. Trump also has the goods on him for wiretapping Trump Tower. Comey’s been taken to a secure holding pending transportation to GITMO, where he’ll face a military tribunal. One thing that’ll come out is that when Comey got hold of Anthony Weiner’s laptop, he found videos of Huma Abedin and Hillary Clinton doing some pretty terrible things to kids. Comey kept that info from the public, probably at Clinton’s request,” our source said.  In closing, we asked our source why, with so many arrests dropping, family and friends of the accused haven’t complained to CNN or MSNBC about their loved ones being abducted in the dead of night.  “The only explanation is the Deep State is keeping them silent,” our source said. “If it became officially known that people like Clinton, Podesta, Abedin, and now Comey have been nabbed by the military, it would weaken the Deep State’s hold on society—because it would show they are losing. And the Deep Staters always want to give the appearance of winning. They won’t be able to for much longer.”  (Visited 150,672 times, 6 visits today)",Military Arrests James Comey,false

As reported previously, U.S. Navy SEALs under Trump’s command staged a March 2 raid on Clinton’s Chappaqua, NY, estate, capturing her and seizing laptops that link the former First Lady to countless atrocities. She has been held under military guard at the Guantanamo Bay Detention Center Camp Delta since March 5.  In just over a week, the villainous, vile creature will stand before a military tribunal consisting of six U.S. military officers handpicked by Donald J. Trump and his advisory board. A Trump source familiar with the proceedings told RRN that the officers who will serve as both judge and jury cover a broad range of military ranks—from O-3 (captain) to 0-9 (Lt. General)—selected from all branches of U.S. Armed Forces.  “The choice was not done hastily. Trump’s team spent weeks picking the officers. Trump wanted to remove himself from the equation and ensure that the officers picked were not tainted by any bias for Clinton. No matter what, the odds are stacked against her. A tribunal isn’t an ordinary trial, and Clinton is no longer an American citizen,” our source said.  Stripped of her citizenship, Clinton is no longer afforded the protections of the U.S. Constitution and Geneva Convention. She is a detainee, or enemy combatant, which means she has no rights, not even the right to remain silent. In a military tribunal, silence is equated with guilt.  “Clinton was asked if she wanted an advocate to speak on her behalf, but the loon said she would defend herself. She decried the whole idea of a military tribunal as lunacy and has been babbling out how her people are going to free her. It doesn’t look good for her. She’s being charged with treason, sedition, assassinations, assassination attempts—the list goes on,” our source said.  Moreover, Trump has held Clinton responsible for the deaths of four Americans in the Benghazi Massacre: Ambassador Chris Stephens, Information Officer Sean Smith, and CIA contractors Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods, both former U.S. Navy SEALs. Clinton’s inaction led to their deaths; therefore, Trump decreed she must be held to account.  Our source said Clinton faces one of three possible outcomes: acquittal, life at GITMO, or a firing squad.  (Visited 66,477 times, 8 visits today)",Clinton Military Tribunal Set for April 8,false

A confidential source familiar with Trump’s plan to drain the swamp and restore American prosperity to the people told RRN that U.S. Special Forces operating on Trump’s authority conducted simultaneous “nab and grab” missions to apprehend Clinton’s co-conspirators. Trump picked Easter Sunday to arrest the traitors because he believed it to be the best day to catch them unaware and at home, our source added.  Trump’s tactical expertise paid dividends.  At approximately 2:00 p.m., a Special Forces detachment out of Fort Bragg captured Abedin at her parents’ home near Lansing, Michigan, where the family had gathered for Easter dinner. Although Abedin is a radical Islamic Jihadist with obvious ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, she spent her political years pretending to be a Christian.  “Trump learned Abedin would be at her parents’ house for Easter. As you know, Clinton is already at GITMO awaiting trial. She’s given up a lot of info, including on Abedin—she’s allegedly revealed that she and Abedin partook in Adrenochrome infusions from Haitian children. When Navy Seals captured Clinton, they found evidence of this on her laptops, and now her own words have incriminated her and her criminal conspirators,” our source said.  As Huma Abedin was arrested and escorted to a clandestine holding facility in south Florida, a simultaneous offensive was made against John Podesta at his springtime home in the outskirts of Bethesda, MD. Special Forces Operators of the 3rd Special Forces Group descended on his Friendship Village home and used non-lethal force to subdue two bodyguards protecting Podesta and his wife, Mary.  A preliminary report said that U.S. forces suffered no casualties.  Moreover, it’s understood that Donald J. Trump had cleared the operation with General Gen. Richard D. Clarke, Commander of U.S. Special Operations Command.  This is a developing story. More details as they arrive.

170,103422510407799292520953641957755654868,"The United States military has arrested Dr. Deborah Birx, also known as “the scarf lady,” after authenticating reports that she and her partner in crime, the still at-large Dr. Anthony Fauci, had conspired with the CDC to deceive the American public into believing that face masks were an effective method to mitigate the spread of Covid-19.  As reported in February, Birx’s name was placed on a sealed indictment after President Donald J. Trump obtained a lengthy email chain between her and Deep State Dr. Anthony Fauci. In it, Birx and Fauci discussed whether face masks mitigated the spread of Covid-19, and they admitted to one another that masks were completely ineffective at preventing Covid-19 from entering the human respiratory system. To the contrary, they acknowledged that protracted “masking” had serious side effects on human physiology, especially among the children, the elderly, and immunocompromised people.  Nonetheless, Birx wrote in an email to Fauci that “regardless of POTUS’s stance, we must continue to encourage and enforce masking because it will give people a sense of calm and make them feel safe.”  That illusion of safety was a major contributing factor in the deaths of 15,000 Americans, according to a military study that evaluated all alleged Covid-19 fatalities in the United States.  For example, a masked 13-year-old boy suddenly dropped dead while playing football in 90-degree heat in Reno, Nevada. It turned out he was asthmatic but had never received a clinical diagnosis. His mother, a mask advocate, had heard Dr. Birx say on television that outdoor activities did not preclude wearing a mask when social distancing was impossible. Since football is a contact sport, she feared her child might contract Covid-19 from another non-masked child, and thus demanded her son mask up anytime he was around other children. Her irrational fear, coupled with Birx’s hysteria, resulted in the boy’s death. Incidentally, the CDC claimed he died of Covid-19, even though the boy had never received a test.  Another example: A 26-year-old Long Island woman died after a short battle with Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, more commonly known as MRSA, a type of flesh-eating bacteria that is highly resistant to most antibiotics. She developed the illness, which attacked her face, days after her employer, citing CDC guidelines, imposed a mask mandate. The bacteria literally ate her face, leaving her unrecognizable. She expired three days later, and the CDC listed her cause of death as Covid-19.  Those are only 2 of 15,000 evaluated cases.  A confidential source involved in Donald J. Trump’s Deep State War said: “Along with Fauci, who will soon be apprehended too, the U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General’s Corps is holding Birx responsible for all the fatalities. It’s mass medical malpractice and mass murder. They acted on the indictment Wednesday morning.”  On 26 May, plain-clothed JAG investigators arrived at the multigenerational Pennsylvania home where Birx resides with her husband and the family of their eldest daughter. JAG, our source said, informed Birx she was being placed under arrest by order of the United States military and in accordance with Section 252 of the U.S. Insurrection Act of 1807. Birx reportedly appeared confused, and her husband, a lawyer, protested the “unlawful intrusion” of their home, saying that neither JAG nor Donald Trump had authority over the citizenry.  Birx was handcuffed and escorted from the home, and her family was issued a gag order forbidding them from discussing Birx’s arrest with the media. Violating the order, JAG told them, would carry a stiff penalty, including prison.  (Visited 258,849 times, 6 visits today)",U.S. Military Arrests Dr. Deborah Birx,false

Brett Blomme, 38, was arrested on Tuesday for allegedly uploading 27 images and videos of children being sexually abused on the messaging app Kik.  Blomme was held overnight and released with a signature. He has been ordered to stay off social media and file-sharing services and is not allowed near any children except the two that he adopted with his husband.  “The couple has two adopted children. Court records do not suggest they are part of any of the illegal images. Child Protective Services is involved with their current placement, defense attorney Christopher Van Wagner said during the court hearing,” the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reports.  TRENDING: ""I Went There for You My Son"" - J6 Political Prisoner Chris Quaglin Was Brutally Beaten in Jail and Denied Celiac-Safe Food - Here Is His Heartfelt Letter to His Son on His First Birthday -- Please Donate  Blomme is accused of uploading the images both from his home and from the judge’s chambers.  The alleged pedophile judge was the president and CEO of the Cream City Foundation, which runs the Milwaukee Drag Queen Story Hour for local children. As of early Thursday morning, however, all articles and mentions of him had been scrubbed from their website. The links were still cached by Google’s search engine and his role remained detailed on his LinkedIn page.  According to his LinkedIn profile, Blomme served as the president and CEO of the drag story hour foundation until August 2020, when he left to become a judge.  “Brett Blomme is the President & CEO of Cream City Foundation. He has nearly 15 years of experience in philanthropy, community organizing, law, and nonprofit management. Before joining CCF, Brett served as the Director of Major Gifts for the AIDS Resource Center of Wisconsin (ARCW),” his profile states.  Assistant Attorney General David Maas, who is prosecuting the case, has argued that Blomme should not have any unsupervised contact with children — including the two that he and his husband adopted.  “A 44-page search warrant filed Friday by a DCI special agent said investigators found Blomme, using the name ‘dommasterbb,’ uploaded 27 videos and images containing child pornography. Two of the files were uploaded at a Milwaukee County government building, the search warrant said,” the Journal Sentinel report continues. “The special agent sought permission to search Blomme’s courtroom, chambers, houses in Milwaukee and Dane counties and his 2017 Audi. Blomme is currently assigned to Milwaukee County Children’s Court.”  A preliminary hearing has been set for May 29. The state Supreme Court has suspended Blomme from any judicial duties, without pay, per the high court’s “superintending and administrative authority.”  Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, who advocated for Blomme’s election, said that the charges were “a complete surprise.”  “The allegations are alarming,” Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett said. “Before he was elected to the bench, the judge served as chair of the Board of Zoning Appeals, an appointed board in City Government. The reports of the arrest came as a complete surprise.”  If convicted, Blomme faces up to 25 years in prison for each count.",BREAKING: Former President of Drag Queen Story Hour Foundation and Children’s Court Judge Arrested on Seven Counts of Child Porn,false

Les constats sont simples :    Il y a une inadéquation entre les données publiées par les autorités et la réalité sur le terrain.    Ils ont trois sources d’information, outre les emails et messages d’effets secondaires qu’ils reçoivent par le biais d’internet.  Ces trois sources sont Ynet, site d'information israélien, la base de données du ministère de la santé israélien, et la base aux Etats-Unis du VAERS (effets secondaires).

The paper interviews Aix-Marseille University Faculty of Medicine Emerging Infectious and Tropical Diseases Unit's Dr. Hervé Seligmann and engineer Haim Yativ about their research and data analysis. They claim that Pfizer's experimental shot causes ""mortality hundreds of times greater in young people compared to mortality from coronavirus without the vaccine, and dozens of times more in the elderly, when the documented mortality from coronavirus is in the vicinity of the vaccine dose, thus adding greater mortality from heart attack, stroke, etc.""    Dr Hervé Seligmann works at the Emerging Infectious and Tropical Diseases Research Unit, Faculty of Medicine, Aix-Marseille University, Marseille, France. He is of Israeli-Luxembourg nationality. He has a B. Sc. In Biology from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and has written over 100 scientific publications.      FranceSoir writes that they follow publications, data analyzes, and feedback from various countries on vaccination, and have therefore taken an interest in the Nakim article, asking to interview them in order to understand their analysis and its limitations.    The authors of the article declare they have no conflicts or interests other than having children in Israel.    After a presentation, the authors discussed their data analysis, the validations carried out, limitations, and above all, their conclusions that they compare with data received via a Health Ministry Freedom of Information Act request.    Their findings are:    There is a mismatch between the data published by the authorities and the reality on the ground.  They have three sources of information, besides the emails and adverse event reports they receive through the Internet. These three sources are Israeli news site Ynet, the Israeli Health Ministry database, and the U.S. federal Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) database.  In January 2021, there were 3,000 records of vaccine adverse events, including 2,900 for mRNA vaccines.  Compared to other years, mortality is 40 times higher.  On February 11, a Ynet article presented data related to vaccination. The authors of the Nakim article claim to have debunked this analysis based on data published by Ynet itself: “We took the data by looking at mortality during the vaccination period, which spans 5 weeks. By analyzing these data, we arrived at startling figures that attribute significant mortality to the vaccine.""  The authors say “vaccinations have caused more deaths than the coronavirus would have caused during the same period.""  Haim Yativ and Dr. Seligmann declare that for them, ""this is a new Holocaust,"" in face of Israeli authority pressure to vaccinate citizens.    They also invite specialists to complete their analyses, and intend to pursue legal follow-up to their discovery. The Health Ministry was not available for comment on a FranceSoir query regarding the findings.    The authors also deplored ""the fact of not being able to communicate on this vital information"" to their fellow citizens.    On their site, Nakim writes: ""On February 11, 2021, Ynet (the most known Israeli News website) published a confused and confusing article entitled 'Vaccination efficiency data in Israel, and its rapid effects on the young'.    ""Our reanalyses of these data explain why during the massive vaccination project initiated mid-December 2020 during a confinement, daily new confirmed COVID-19 cases failed to decrease as they do during confinements, and, more importantly, why numbers of serious, critical, and death cases increased during that period that covered at least one month. From mid-December to mid-February (two months), 2,337 among all Israeli 5,351 official COVID-deaths occurred. Our analyses indicate orders of magnitude increases in deaths rates during the 5-week long vaccination process, as compared to the unvaccinated and those after completing the vaccination process. Presumably, asymptomatic cases before vaccination, and those infected shortly after the 1st dose, tend to develop graver symptoms than those unvaccinated.    ""The Ynet article is organized in an exciting way and uses data provided in an erroneous way by the Ministry of Health. It is unclear whether this was intentional to prove the vaccine's efficiency or if this was done erroneously because the provided data were misunderstood. Note that in Israel, all vaccines are from Pfizer.    ""The data in the table, rather than indicating the vaccine efficacy, indicate the vaccine's adverse effects,"" the authors conclude.

Mr Kouts qui ne comprend rien aux chiffres manifestement, continue comme suit  ""Revenons à l’article, il s’intéresse donc à lier l’augmentation des morts par le vaccin, qui induirait du COVID19 (ou un autre truc idiot comme ça). Il aurait tué 40 fois plus dans la même période que la COVID19 elle-même.  Comment ils calculent ça ? Facile on prend une période avec moins de morts (tous les mois de mars jusqu’à début décembre), qu’on compare au mois le plus meurtrier de la pandémie en Israël (véridique, c'est sa méthodologie...).  (Remarquez qu’on passe de 3,5 fois à 40 fois on sait pas trop comment – 40 fois ça voudrait dire 334 * 40 = 13360 en un mois à comparer avec la mortalité totale en Israël qui est de 45 000 annuellement… n’importe quoi donc)""    gros mensonge puisque nous avons comparés les chiffres de mortalité a rien d'autre qu'au tableau rouge ramenè par Ynet, sur lequel ils se sont basé pour démontrer l’efficacité du vaccin de Pfizer en précisant bien que ce tableau parlait de comparaison sur 5 semaines.    Mr Kouts continu ses élucubrations en disant pas moins:  ""C’est donc évidemment totalement débile d’utiliser VAERS pour les cas en israël (pas la même population, densité, comorbiditsé…) ni les mêmes façon de vacciner selon les pays, ni les mêmes vaccins""    Mr Kouts il serait plutôt ""débile"" de ne pas comprendre qu' a été l'usage que nous avons fait des données du Vaers, les données américaines nous ont été utiles pour déterminer le rapport de la mortalité entre les ages du vaccin de Pfizer. Cette donnée n'est pas dépendante d'un pays quelconque. Mr kouts a de nouveau prouvé qu'il n'aurait jamais réussi les examens pour être admis au Technion, ne parlons pas d'y obtenir un diplôme.    continuons Mr Kouts qui a la technique du matraquage d'inepties pour fatiguer ses lecteurs passent ensuite enfin au grand tableau de Ynet avec les données.    ""On voit sur +60 ans 636 morts au total, mais surtout on voit que la grande majorité intervient dans les 13 jours après la première dose. Cela prouve donc l’efficacité du vaccin (qu'il ne veut pas voir)  Mais non, lui voit quoi ? Que le vaccin a tué 646 personnes et mis à l’hôpital 865 !  Voici son explication qui pour lui montre que c’est dû au vaccin pour l’hôpital""    Mr Kouts qui ne comprend absolument rien a la mortalité du covid voit dans le fait que les morts arrivent dans les 13 jours suivant la première dose la preuve de l’efficacité du vaccin, grave erreur Mr Kouts comme le prouve les rapports du Vaers sur le vaccin de Pfizer les morts tombent en moyenne dans les 4 jours suivant le vaccin.  De plus Mr Kouts la mortalité normale de gens testés positifs au Covid est bien inférieur a 1% cela incluant les vieux de plus de 80 ans, alors que dans le tableau sur lequel vous aussi vous vous appuyez pour vanter les mérites de Pfizer la mortalité globale est de 1.5 pourcent (660 pour 43871) alors que comme décrit durant l'interview les gens de plus de 80 ans qui représente 37% de la mortalité du covid en Israël n'y figurait pratiquement pas car vaccinés des la fin décembre et que le tableau est daté du 10 février. De plus les 1251 malades graves ou critiques du tableau et qui font parti intégrante de l’échantillon de 43871 vaccinés vont eux aussi malheureusement fournir leurs quotes parts de mortalité supérieur a 20% d'entre eux. cela nous amenant a une mortalité supérieur a 2% sur les 43871 vaccinés soit au minimum 3 fois supérieur a celle de gens non vaccines incluant les + de 80 ans alors que le tableau de Ynet ne les incluaient pas.    De plus Mr Kouts fait abstraction des morts subites (cardiaques, AVC) suite au ""vaccin"" de Pfizer qui ne sont pas comptabilisées comme des décès Covid.      pour terminer l'embrouille, Mr Kouts nous ramène au début de la video sur le VAERS et nous dis:  ""(sur la vidéo france soir ils comparent les morts vaccins covid en janvier 2021 VS tous les autres vaccins en janvier 2020 - les 2 sans aucune base et source - enfin c'est pas clair et ils sont pas d'accord entre eux)""    gros mensonges supplémentaires que voila, alors que nous parlions du Vaers pour signifier l’énorme nombre de décès rapportés en Janvier 2021 aux états unis pendant la vaccination pfizer/Moderna de 456 décès sur 3000 rapports comparés a seulement 14 décès en Janvier 2020 sur un nombre similaires de rapports concernant des vaccins classiques.    en Résumé Mr Ari Kouts fait parti des innombrables Troll que je côtoie sur facebook diffusant de la désinformation. au vu du nombre de Tweet mensonger de ce monsieur il me semble qu'il était grand temps de lui clouer le bec.    (Mr Kouts je vous laisse debunker les innombrables fautes d'orthographes et de ponctuation de ma réponse, vous m'excuserais mais vous ne valez pas la peine que je les corrige)      _________________  הצטרפו לערוץ של נקים בטלגרם להתעדכן:  https://t.me/Nakim_org_Ch      הסקר קובע: רוב הציבור בישראל סבור שהשחיתות פוגעת בחייו היום יומיים,  חתום על העצומה נגד שחיתות הממסד ומערכת המשפט והצטרף ל""נקים""    ניתן להשיג את חיים יטיב הדובר של ארגון ""נקים"" באמצעות טלגרם @HaimYativ או דוא""ל  ניתן להשיג את חיים יטיב הדובר של ארגון ""נקים"" באמצעות טלגרם @HaimYativ או דוא""ל haim@nakim.org    השופט מישאל חשין:המלחמה בשחיתות היא מלחמה להגנה עצמית בה לא לוקחים שבויים  השופט מישאל חשין:המלחמה בשחיתות היא מלחמה להגנה עצמית בה לא לוקחים שבויים _________________הצטרפו לערוץ של נקים בטלגרם להתעדכן:  חיים יטיב              הצטרף: 23 ינו' 2006  הודעות: 994  דובר של `נקים`הצטרף: 23 ינו' 2006הודעות: 994    פורסם: שישי 05.03.21 19:04 נושא ההודעה: Jean-François Cliche débunké ou Le Soleil ouuuust a l’ombre    Jean-François Cliche débunké ou ""Le Soleil"" ouuuust a l’ombre    Un nouvel essai de débunkage de nakim.org et cette fois de Mr Soleil. (son article est également joint plus bas en PDF au cas ou...)    Comme je l’ai écris avec Mr Kouts plus haut quand il s’agit de santé publique je suis sans pitié donc Mr Soleil désolé pour ce qui va suivre.    Je n’ai pas réagis tout de suite car j’étais occupé et grand bien m’en a pris car l’article de Mr Soleil a été repris ici devinez par qui ? par MSN network oui !!! le réseau de Microsoft celui de B I L L G A T E S du coup d’une pierre deux coups !    J’étais donc occupé a débunker ici l’article pseudo-scientifique du New England Journal of medicine de mes concitoyens Israéliens ventant les qualités du « vaccin » Coco-vide de Pfizer voir ici, oui oui ceux la même qui avouent toucher des subventions de Pfizer pour leur «bons et loyaux » services a la science. Donc après avoir démontrer avec le Dr Seligmann que leur papier scientifique et aussi neutre et fiable qu’une pub de Pfizer nous pouvons enfin passer a Mr Soleil qui a lui aussi tenter de nous « éclairer » sur les mérites de l’injection d’ARN expérimentale de Pfizer (désolé de ne pas l’appeler vaccin mais notez que je me suis retenu par respect pour vous d’écrire poison ).    Mr Soleil commence mal en traitant Nakim de « site avec des contenus à forte teneur conspirationniste » Mr Soleil qui détient la vérité première qui lui a probablement été transmise par Bill Gates en personne a appris l’hébreu et le droit israélien en deux temps trois mouvements et s’est également spécialisé sur le sujet de la corruption en Israël et du haut de son génie nullement égalé s’est déjà permis de jauger les actions juridiques et autres de NAKIM à la cours suprême en Israël cités maintes fois par la presse israélienne et a nous traiter de conspirationniste a deux balles… bon ok avec le Soleil on ne discute pas…    Après avoir rabaissé le support c’est au tour des auteurs :  « L’auteur du billet, Haim Yativ, se présente comme un ingénieur » je ne me présente pas comme un ingénieur dommage de ne pas avoir lu avant ma réponse a votre collègue Ari Kouts, je suis ingénieur et diplômé de pas n’importe quelle école un ptit coup d’œil au dessus chez Kouts votre altesse…  Quand au Dr Seligmann il n’est pas un médecin distribuant des médicaments comme le conçoit Mr Soleil mais c’est un biologiste chercheur ayant publié plus de 100 articles scientifiques et ayant travaillé des années chez le Prof Raoult, bref a la pointe dans le domaine.    Mr Soleil continue donc bien lancé avec ses inepties et nous raconte des « histoires de pomme et d’orange » :  « Le hic, cependant, c’est qu’il compare des pommes avec des oranges : le nombre de patients dans un état grave est un «instantané» qui ne concerne qu’une seule journée alors que le tableau de Ynet cumule des cas survenus sur une assez longue période (au moins deux semaines, voire plus). Pour s’en faire une idée, on n’a qu’à songer au fait que le tableau de Ynet fait état de 660 décès alors que la COVID-19 tue environ 35 personnes par jour depuis un mois. On ne peut donc absolument rien tirer d’une telle comparaison. »    Mr Soleil qui lit ce qui l’arrange a apparemment omis dans l’article la phrase :  “For that purpose we need first to understand that the provided table describes the state of COVID-19 patients that got the first or the second vaccine dose at given dates, as started in the article ""…emerges from the data that among 856 patients above 60 years in serious state hospitalized at this time…"" we assume that the article published February 11 reflects the situation in hospitals the previous day, hence February 10 2021, or February 11 2021.”    Le tableau nous décrit donc clairement le nombre de gens hospitalisés a la date de l’article et pas accumulé comme le prétend Mr Soleil, en cas de doute Mr Soleil qui comprend si bien l’hébreu comme dit plus haut aurais pu se pencher sur la version israélienne qui est sans appel « kaet » est en hébreu a l’instant présent.    Quand au nombre de décès il est bien évidemment accumulé comme nous l’avons bien décrit dans l’article.    Maintenant sûre de lui Mr Soleil s’arme de chiffre de la banque mondiale pas moins (dis moi qui tu fréquente je te dirais qui tu es…) pour nous dire que la mortalité de 0.05% pour 5 semaines est à peine plus élevé que la mortalité attendue de 0.048%    Le paramètre qu’oublie notre prétendu critique scientifique c’est notre phrase: "" This death rate relates mainly to a relatively young population whose vaccination stated on January 19, a period during which most vaccinated were below 65.""    Qui explique donc pourquoi ce chiffre de mortalité est excessif puisque la part du lion de la mortalité en Israël comme dans tout autre pays est compose des gens de plus de 65 ans et pas le contraire.    De plus et essentiellement la mortalité de 0.5% par an ramenée par Mr Soleil est la mortalité globale toute cause confondue incluant suicide accident de voiture cancers, attaque cardiaque et autre, alors que l’année passée la part du Covid dans cette mortalité était de bien moins de 10%. Tant et si bien qu'une mortalité que de Covid qui dépasse la mortalité générale habituelle sur cette période de 5 semaine et cela pour une écrasante majorité de gens de moins de 65 ans cela est une CATASTROPHE.    Mr Soleil continue avec ses élucubrations sous le titre « –la pire vague » expliquant que la hausse de la mortalité en décembre a février est juste causée par la monte des cas Covid. Manque de pot pour la lumière émanant du cerveau de Mr Soleil, nous avons débunké l’article du New England Journal Of Médicine et au passage nous avons glané la preuve de nos dires de leurs propres données. La première injection de Pfizer multiplie par 3 le nombre de malades Covid chez les vaccinés. Maintenant que je vous ai mis a l’ombre Mr Soleil, Je vous invite a lire notre article, puisque faute d’emploi vous aurez tout le temps de réfléchir a vos actes d’avoir encouragé les gens a se faire vacciner avec ce produit plus qu’inquiétant.    Quand a votre final et votre verdict vous savez maintenant quoi en faire au vu de notre débunking de  L’article scientifique sur lequel le ministère de la santé israélienne et vous-même vous vous basez.

Pearson  No Comments  0  SHARES  SHARE ON FACEBOOK  SHARE ON TWITTER  Advertisements    By Niall McCrae-    Anyone raising concern about the safety of Covid-19 vaccines faces derision as an ‘anti-vaxxer’, but the real extremists are those who refuse to hear evidence that something is going badly wrong with this mass experimental intervention. Now a Public Health England  Advertisements    report confirms that infections increase during the fortnight after vaccination.    As the vaccination programme began in earnest in January, worrying signs came from care homes, where many of the initial target population of people aged over 80 reside. At Pemberley House in Basingstoke, a third of the residents (24) died of Covid-19 in a home that had previously been free from the disease. Similar reports emerged from Germany.    The clearest indications came from small countries that strove to vaccinate their entire adult population. The British enclave of Gibraltar was supplied with the Pfizer vaccine on 16th January and the elderly were swiftly jabbed. Suddenly this tiny state, home to 33 thousand, had the worst Covid-19 morality in the world (now 2761 per million). From merely 9 deaths in December, now almost a hundred have died. The health minister angrily denied claims that the vaccine was killing people, but eventually admitted that some deaths had occurred in recipients.    The United Arab Emirates received large batches of the Chinese Sinopharm vaccine as well as the Pfizer product in December. As stated by Amer Sharif, head of the Covid-19 Command & Control Centre in Dubai, the UAE aimed to be the first country in the world to achieve 100% vaccination of eligible adults. An increase in deaths was attributed to mutant strains, but as in other countries the rate rose disproportionately in the vaccinated age band. On 10th February a new daily high of 18 deaths from the coronavirus was recorded, and the trend has continued. Considerably more people are dying than in the first wave last spring – despite the hubristic inoculation.    More evidence of iatrogenic harm came from Israel, which started vaccinating on 19th December. As reported by former New York Times journalist Alex Berenson, while Covid-19 mortality escalated among Israelis throughout January, in Palestine it declined steeply after a surge in December. Yet the Palestinians had no vaccine.    This correlation is more than coincidental. Analysis    of Israeli health ministry data by Hervé Seligmann at Aix-Marseilles University indicates that about 40 times more elderly people died of Covid-19 in the three weeks between their first and second doses than among those who were not vaccinated. Sacrificial lambs? Deaths in Israel are now falling, which politicians and media attribute to the vaccine, although there is a global trend of the virus becoming less deadly.    The mortal complication has a temporal pattern that varies between countries, apparently depending on when vaccination started. Jordan was supplied with 3800 tons of Sinopharm on 9th January, after approval for ‘emergency use’. The King of Jordan and other prominent figures were shown on television receiving the vaccine, to encourage the people to follow. A deal was also struck for 2.2 million doses of the Pfizer product. At this time nearly four thousand had died of Covid-19.    By the end of February half a million had been jabbed, but this was slow progress in a land of ten million. Meanwhile coronavirus cases had surged, as had deaths. A night curfew was imposed. Yet most of those dying were in the age group prioritised for the vaccine; many would have had the supposedly life-saving substance. Yesterday another 37 died, and the death toll is now approaching five thousand. Perhaps that explains hesitancy in the Hashemite kingdom.    It should not be unexpected that Covid-19 vaccines have deleterious as well as intended effects. Pfizer data shows significant lymphocyte depletion in the first week after vaccination. June Raine, chief of the UK medicines regulator MHRA, acknowledged that ‘a week or two’ is needed to build up immunity after the first jab.    The Public Health England study, which was hailed by health secretary Matt Hancock for the reported 80% decrease in hospitalisations, actually showed a 48% rise in infections after the first dose of Pfizer and Astra Zeneca vaccines. The authors, however, blamed this on a higher risk of exposure. Mary Ramsay, head of immunisations at PHE, stated that ‘this adds to growing evidence that the vaccines are working to reduce infections and save lives’. She glossed over the hundreds who died after getting the jab.    This is what may be happening. Vulnerable people who unknowingly had Covid-19 or whose immune system was keeping it at bay, succumbed to the disease after the vaccine lowered their immunity. The virus struck hard, leading to sever symptoms, cytokine storm and pneumonia. It is also possible that previously shielding persons were cross-infected by the vaccinators.    This needs proper scrutiny, not reckless denial by those who are meant to protect us. This defensiveness and censorship is how the thalidomide scandal arose. The authorities have apparently cast aside everything we have learned about ethical safeguards in clinical and experimental treatment. Perhaps it is relevant that the British medicine regulator is heavily funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.    Why aren’t doctors raising the alert? In medical training, hardly a day is given to learning about vaccines, and Big Pharma has undue influence on this noble profession. With critical thinking and dissent stifled by the Covid regime, most doctors are mere conformists. We must appeal to the brave few medics to continue their efforts to expose the deadly hazard of this highly dubious intervention.

(his article is also attached below in PDF in case Mr Soleil and Bill Gates' MSN/Dan Satherley will retract...) As I wrote with Mr. Kouts above when it comes to public health I am ruthless so Mr. Soleil sorry for what follows.    I didn’t react right away because I was busy and it was very good for me because Mr. Soleil’s article was picked up, guess by whom? by MSN network yes !!! !!! the Microsoft network that of B I L L G A T E S!!! with one stone two birds!      So I was busy debunking here the pseudo-scientific article of the New England Journal of medicine of my fellow Israelis touting the qualities of Pfizer's Coco-vid “vaccine”, yes yes those same who admit receiving grants from Pfizer for their “good and loyal” service to science.    So after having demonstrated with Dr Seligmann that their scientific paper is as neutral and reliable as a Pfizer ad, we can finally move on to Mr Soleil who also tried to ""enlighten"" us on the merits of the experimental RNA injection from Pfizer (sorry not to call it a vaccine but note that out of respect for you I refrained from writing poison).    Mr. Soleil starts badly by treating Nakim as a ""site with high conspiracy content"" Mr. Soleil who holds the primary truth which was probably transmitted to him by Bill Gates in person learned Hebrew and Israeli law in two days and has also specialized in the subject of corruption in Israel and from the height of his unparalleled genius has already taken the liberty of gauging the legal and other actions of NAKIM at the Supreme Court in Israel cited many times by the Israeli press and to treat us as a double-barreled conspirator ... well, ok with the Sun, we don't argue ...      After lowering the medium, it's the authors' turn: ""The author of the post, Haim Yativ, presents himself as an engineer"" I do not present myself as an engineer too bad not to have read before my answer to your colleague Ari Kouts, I am an engineer and a graduate of not just any school but the Technion, a little glance above at my Kouts debunking your highness ...    As for Dr Seligmann, he is not a doctor distributing drugs as Mr Soleil conceives, but he is a research biologist who has published more than 100 scientific articles and who worked for years with Prof Didier Raoult, in short at the cutting edge in the field.    Mr. Soleil therefore continues well with his ineptitude and tells us ""stories of apple and orange"": ""The problem, however, is that he compares apples with oranges: the number of patients in serious condition is a 'snapshot' which concerns only one day while the Ynet table accumulates cases that have occurred over a fairly long period (at least two weeks, or even longer). To get an idea, one only has to think of the fact that the Ynet table shows 660 deaths as COVID-19 has killed around 35 people a day for the past month. So absolutely nothing can be drawn from such a comparison. ""    Mr. Soleil, who reads what suits him, apparently omitted from the article the sentence: “For that purpose we need first to understand that the provided table describes the state of COVID-19 patients that got the first or the second vaccine dose at given dates, as started in the article""… emerges from the data that among 856 patients above 60 years in serious state hospitalized at this time… ""we assume that the article published February 11 reflects the situation in hospitals the previous day, hence February 10 2021, or February 11 2021.""    The table therefore clearly describes the number of people hospitalized at the date of the article and not accumulated as claimed by Mr. Soleil, in case of doubt Mr. Soleil who understands Hebrew so well as said above could have looked into the Israeli version which is without appeal ""kaet"" is in Hebrew at this day.  As for the number of deaths, it is obviously accumulated as we have described in the article.    Now sure of himself, Mr Soleil is armed with data from the World Bank no less (tell me who you frequent I would tell you who you are ...) to tell us that the mortality of 0.05% for 5 weeks is barely higher than the expected mortality of 0.048% The parameter that our alleged scientific critic forgets is our sentence: ""This death rate relates mainly to a relatively young population whose vaccination stated on January 19, a period during which most vaccinated were below 65."" So that explains why this death figure is excessive since the lion's share of mortality in Israel as in any other country is made up of people over 65 and not the other way around.  In addition and essentially the mortality of 0.5% per year reported by Mr Soleil is the overall mortality from all causes including suicide, car accident, cancer, heart attack and other, while last year the share of Covid in this mortality was far less than 10%.  So much so that a mortality from Covid which exceeds the usual general mortality over this period of 5 weeks and that for an overwhelming majority of people under the age of 65 this is a CATASTROPHE.    Mr Soleil continues with his rantings under the title ""- the worst wave"" explaining that the increase in mortality in December to February is just caused by the rise in Covid cases. unluckily for the light emanating from Mr. Sun's brain, we debunked the New England Journal Of Medicine article and in the process gleaned evidence for our claims from their own data. The first injection of Pfizer multiplies by 3 the number of Covid patients among the vaccinated.    Now that I have put you in the shade Mr Soleil, I invite you to read our article,since for lack of employment you will have all the time to think about your acts of having encouraged people to be vaccinated with this product more that worrying.    Concerning your final and your verdict Mr Jean-François Cliché aka Mr Soleil, you now know what to do with it given our debunking of the scientific article you, Bill Gates' MSN, Dan Satherley and the Israeli Ministry of Health rely on.      concerning your peer Dan Satherley who wrote in addition to your false claims:    ""Another claim in the post is that deaths from COVID-19 in Israel are now slowing because the vaccination campaign is ""losing its momentum"". This is demonstrably false - since mid-January, the number of people dying from COVID-19 each day has more than halved, while vaccination data shows the number of doses administered in Israel has continued its upward trajectory over the past two months, with no signs of slowing down.""    Mr Satherley seems as well specialized in disinformation since we wrote in feb 15.2021:  ""The decrease in vaccinations and in vaccination age will cause a decrease in serious cases""  so from mid january it start getting down because from mid january the 65 and below start being shot with the pfizer RNA experimental product.    if we take a look to what happens since our article in Israel we can see that there was a decrease of serious case of 30 percent that match the decrease of the first shot vaccination rate:  decrease of serious case from 1008 on feb,15 2021 to 710 on march,6 2021      decrease of the vaccination on last 3 weeks  the dark green is the first shot        In conclusion: LeSoleil/Jean-François Cliche+Msn/Dan Satherley=Bill Gates=FAKE NEWS for pushing people to take the shot.

174,335708420951434500580346070461514755495,"Piles of shredded ballots were located today in a dumpster in Maricopa County Arizona. This find occurs only days before the Senate’s audit of the county’s 2020 election results is due to start.  For months the Board of Supervisors in Maricopa County have blocked and delayed any independent audit performed by the Arizona Senate of the County’s results in the 2020 Presidential election. As we’ve reported previously, after being subpoenaed by the Arizona Senate and then suing the Senate to prevent a Senate audit of their 2020 election results, the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors (MCBOS) agreed to have an audit if they could pick the auditors. The two firms they picked they claimed were the only two who were certified by the governmental body the US Election Assistance Commission (EAC). However, we found that these firms were not certified at the time they were selected by the MCBOS:  The MCBOS went ahead and hired the firms they wanted to perform their audit but the audits were never structured to find any suspected fraud in the county. The validity of the 2 million ballots in the county was never even considered in the programs reportedly used by these audit firms:  TRENDING: BEAUTIFUL! Student Confronts Fake News Purveyor Brian Stelter from CNN at Disinfo Conference AND IT'S GLORIOUS! (VIDEO)  This is probably why these audits were set up the way they were (so no fraud would be identified). The auditors came to Phoenix and performed their work and some patriots found out that they could be observed on cameras in the facility where they were doing the work. These patriots watched and even sent a couple of individuals down to the center to check things out late one night. These individuals were greeted with a network that was labeled “f##k you”.  And as we reported, the audits were unprofessional in other areas as well:  This is when the Arizona Senate said enough and passed a bill that would grant the Arizona legislature the authority to subpoena election records like ballots and tabulating equipment and ignore any laws to the contrary.  The Senate is now in the process of selecting an auditor(s) to perform their audit. As the day for their audit approaches the heat must have gotten too hot for those guarding the ballots in Maricopa County.  Per our source on the ground in the County, yesterday an individual went by the Maricopa County Tabulation and election center and found doors wide open with seeming uninhibited access to the facility.  Today some other interested individuals in the county stopped by the same facility and found huge piles of ballots in the dumpster outside the facility.  Someone ordered the ballots be shredded.  We do not yet have the complete information on the shredded ballots.  This is not the first state where we found shredded ballots after the election. This also occurred in Georgia, another state where Biden won by a very slim margin.  What a mess. The corrupt FBI won’t investigate obvious crimes. The corrupt media won’t report them. The communist-leaning Democrats cover them up.",BREAKING EXCLUSIVE: Ballots In Arizona’s Maricopa County Found Shredded and In Dumpster – Days Before Senate Audit To Begin,false
175,29227198939591234440940676358425133405,"The chant “lock her up” has finally seen fruition.  US Navy SEALS loyal to Donald Trump raided Hillary Clinton’s Chappaqua, NY estate and arrested her on charges of treason, destruction of government property, and aiding and abetting the enemy, Real Raw News has learned.  The arrest happened on Tuesday night, according to a source in Trump’s orbit, only hours after Trump had spoken to Rear Admiral Hugh W. Howard at US Special Operations Command and given him a “mammoth trove” of evidence of Clinton’s criminality dating back to her days at the State Department. The evidence allegedly includes thousands of never-before-seen emails, which Clinton acid washed prior to the 2016 presidential election, as well as documents implicating her in plots to assassinate Republican legislators across the country.  The evidence was so compelling, our source added, that Adm. Howard had trouble believing that Clinton wasn’t arrested years ago.  “Trump’s been wanting to get her, and the rest of the Deep State cabal, ever since he set foot in the White House. It has taken him years to dig up the motherload. Once he had military support, he greenlit the operation. Trump’s team, for lack of a better word, had been surveilling Clinton a long time, and he knew she was always alone on Tuesday nights. That’s when the SEALS nabbed her,” our source said.  Under cover of darkness, an eight-man detachment from Naval Special Warfare Group 3 infiltrated the Chappaqua mansion shortly after 2:00am. Mysteriously, Clinton’s two-man Secret Service detail, which normally lives in a guest house on the property, was absent that morning. The SEALS cleared the main building, then silently breached the door to her bedroom, where they found her awake rehearsing a speech before a vanity mirror. They fired a single tranquilizer dart into her neck, our source said, before taping her mouth and sealing a black cloth bag over her head.  The SEALS also seized several laptops and reams of paper, our source said.  “I don’t know where they took her; only Trump knows that. But this is proof that Trump and the military have started taking out the cabal. It took him longer than expected, longer than he wanted, but better late than never. Trump is doing what’s right for America,” our source said.  Trump will soon send her to Guantanamo Bay to face a military tribunal for her crimes against America and its people. GITMO, our source said in closing, is run by the Marine Corps. and the US Navy, both of which have forsaken Joe Biden and instead pledged to help Donald Trump vanquish the forces of darkness that have enshrouded the nation in corruption for decades.

Mixed with other suspected fraud, (like 141,000 ballot drops at 6am the day after the election) all the ballots in this state should be forensically audited to determine the full extent of the election fraud.  There was so much fraud in Michigan in the 2020 election it is difficult to know where to start. There were late-night ballot dumps in Michigan like other states:  There were vans delivering ballots in the early morning after the election under the Detroit TFC Center where votes were being counted:  TRENDING: ""I Went There for You My Son"" - J6 Political Prisoner Chris Quaglin Was Brutally Beaten in Jail and Denied Celiac-Safe Food - Here Is His Heartfelt Letter to His Son on His First Birthday -- Please Donate  Republicans were harassed and prevented from viewing the ballot counting in the same TFC center the next day. When finally some Republican observers forced their way into the room they found the poll workers counting Xerox copies of military ballots all for Biden:  The Washington Free Beacon now reports:  The Michigan secretary of state removed 177,000 inactive voters from the state’s voter rolls after settling a legal challenge. The stateremoved the names from the voter rolls in late January because the voters no longer live in the state or did not respond to the state’s inquiries about their addresses, according to a Tuesday district court announcement. The state performed the post-election audit during a legal battle with the Honest Elections Project, an election watchdog.  Michigan certified the election results in November claiming Joe Biden won by 154,000 votes.  Michigan’s 2020 election was run by crooks.

Maybe even share it with others.  Facemasks in the COVID-19 era: A health hypothesis  From Stanford University  A couple of Quotes  Therefore, it has been hypothesized:  1) the practice of wearing facemasks has compromised safety and efficacy profile,  2) Both medical and non-medical facemasks are ineffective to reduce human-to-human transmission and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19,  3) Wearing facemasks has adverse physiological and psychological effects, 4) Long-term consequences of wearing facemasks on health are detrimental  Long-term consequences of wearing facemask can cause health deterioration, developing and progression of chronic diseases and premature death.

First Court Case Against Mandatory Vaccination in New Mexico  Update February 15, 2021 The last video is a must watch, on the Protest of February 14, 2021 . The Police have been served with a notice of the crimes committed.  They must all look into the crimes, that have been committed, against every Canadian.  The crimes have been reported. The Police have to investigate those crimes.I think sending old people from hospitals to old folks homes might also constitute a major crime. Like murder.  When old people even get a common cold, they can get very sick and die, A cold can turn into things like pneumonia etc. Old people in care homes have very weak immune system and are vulnerable to all sorts of things. If any of the patients from hospitals had the flu that would be devastating. Torturing them with isolation and keeping their families away long term, is a crime. Many died alone, without their families and friends by their side. That is beyond cruel.  Ottawa Canada: Parliament Hill Protest Feb 14, 2021  Update from February 13, 2021  This should never be done to any child. The want to test the vaccines on babies. Experimenting on Babies as young as 6 months old-Wake up People  Update from February 11, 2021 They tested 44 vaccines.These are just a few things they found in the vaccines: Aluminum, Silicon, Barium, Tungsten, Platinum, Silver, Lead, Copper, Zirconium There are more. How do these metals etc get into vaccines? Aluminum is now used instead of mercury in many, and it is bad for children’s health, but the other ones, that is a whole other story. What harm could they do, I have to wonder? I know many of them are toxic if you breath or eat them. Injecting them must be worse. There really needs to be more in depth studies into all the garbage, in vaccines. My jaw dropped after reading everything they found in them. Metals, Micro- Nanocontamination found in Vaccines  There is a new update to one of the posts below. It was updated February, 4, 2021– 2 More victims have been kidnapped at the airport in Canada.  Update Feb 2, 2021  They did a lot of things back in the day to brain wash people.  They are using many of those techniques to brain wash people now. MK Ultra was used to do just that. There is a massive amount of information about this. Mask wearing/face covering, hoods is one of those techniques. Isolation, and this list goes on. They experimented on children too. I cannot find that part yet. they did make the some of the kids wear masks. They also sexually assaulted the children. I think it was about 500 children they used to experiment on.They controlled every aspect of their lives. Much like what is being done today. Stay home is isolation. Can’t travel farther then 5K of your home is open air prison. Taking away jobs, takes your control over your income and life. The news repeated, the same thing over and over. You can thank Dr Cameron for that. They are still doing that, repeating things that is, only we now have a part 2 a so called second virus. So again everyone hears the same thing over and over for days on end. They want to find a cure for Covid/cold/flu (The vaccines) I advise everyone to find out as much about the techniques, they used and have mastered. MK Ultra never ended. They have used, what they learned and improved those techniques over the years. I am sure they are also using techniques, used by China as well. We are being brain washed. There are still a few videos at youtube about MK Ultra. You might want to check them out and think about how things then, are similar to things now. The end goal is to make everyone feel completely helpless and just do what you are told. The Police are playing a big part in that. They do not help they persecute. They are doing the opposite, of what they should be doing. So, when your really need help, who do you call or turn to? There is no one. That is MK Ultra for sure. Anyone on pharma drugs are more susceptible to all of this. There sure are a lot of them out there. Dr Cameron would be considered a so called expert.  There is some information here on MK Ultra. This is just the tip of the iceberg.  Ted was ex FBI. He investigated many things. Child trafficking and many other areas. He investigated cults. He went down a lot of rabbit holes. He died in 20211. He did leave information behind. I advise downloading and keeping any files you find interesting as the site will vanish. It will give you a small idea of how things worked.  One of those groups is called The Finders, which Ted Gunderson said is operated by the CIA.  A film called The Sleep Room highlighted the brainwashing experiments, including electroshock and sleep therapy, conducted on psychiatric patients by Dr. Ewen Cameron at Montreal’s Allan Memorial Institute in the 1950s and 1960s. Here is the Movie they talk about. A bit over 2 hours long. The Sleep Room The CIA and MK Ultra in Canada., This baced on the truth and can be verified by the Fifth Estate reports, also still on youtube. For all Canadians if you can download those videos, as they will vanish too.  Update Feb 4, 2021  Warning people can just vanish. 2 More victims have been kidnapped at the airport in Canada.  Canada has become a complete insult to human dignity (your friends or relatives could just vanish)  Well I found something that is worse then, Canada or maybe equal too it, a hospital in the US.  Nothing like holding a patient hostage or it could also be considered kidnapping of an old woman. This is not the world anyone wants to live in. This is insanity. The Police are as insane, as the so called Leaders, who are making the world into a dictatorship. Any and all Police should stop pulling this garbage. Their job is to protect the people. Seems world wide in most places, they are doing the opposite. They are waging war against the People. The People who pay their wages by the way. Now imagine if that was your mother, father, child, wife, husband, sister, brother, aunt, uncle or a close friend, in that hospital. How would you feel?  The WHO thinks this is a good idea. They think taking and locking people up is just fine and dandy. They even thin going into your home and taking your kids or whoever is a good idea. Ryan said that a while back.  Community Bands Together to Rescue Elderly Woman Medically Kidnapped  I listened to the WHO press conference for Jan 29, 2021 No mention of vaccines killing or maiming people. They just keep pushing the dangerous vaccines. By the way the vaccine for H1N1 Tedros talked about at the end, harmed a lot of children. For information on that go HERE Loads of information on the horrid things that happened, as well as a lot on how the WHO works with drug companies. Tedros must think everyone in the world is stupid.  They are responsible for many deaths and many more to come, from the Vaccines and the Lock downs.  If anyone trusts them, then they need to get some drastically needed help with that.  The reporters don’t even ask important questions. Like how many have died from the vaccines to date or been harmed.  Update January 30, 2021  The VAERS system is reporting 329 deaths (and we know this is a tiny percentage. Less then 1% that is. ) and close to 10k injured. Go HERE for that information. Or check the VAERS link below.  Update January 30, 2021 Adding VAERS  In the U.S., which relies almost exclusively on passive surveillance, the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) Check it out you might be shocked, at what you find.  The site the story came from has updated their story a bit, WHO does change their recommendations rather often. One day they will say one thing and the next week or a month latter, that could change. I did find a video of them saying, to not wear a mask unless you were sick, however. It was from another date of course. But they did say that. They a few weeks ago, changed their mind on the cycles to run the PCR tests at. They lowered the cycles. Which means you get less false positives. But whatever. They have changed their mind on herd immunity I think twice or three times in the past year. Del Bigtee caught that one. They changed, what constitutes a pandemic a while back as well. The Children;s Health Defense caught that one, if I remember correctly. I have that one somewhere, but at the moment I don’t have time to hunt it down. They said lockdowns were good and then lockdowns are bad. I have no idea their thoughts on that one today. They are probably back to saying lockdowna are good. They change things all the time. So one day they could say one thing and then latter change it. Anyway the video in question will be below the story. You might want to download that, if you can. It might vanish like so many other things vanish these days.  There are some studies etc on the dangers of mask wearing in the following post. The BC Parent did some homework and a few other studies/reports have been added as well. Even on most packages they say they do not protect you from viruses.  Message to BC Educators from a Concerned Parent  January 25, 2021  Written by John O’Sullivan  In a telling admission made on January 22, 2021, the World Health Organization now say there is no scientific medical reason for any healthy person to wear a mask outside of a hospital. Sadly, our corrupt politicians and mainstream media only relate the bad news.  If you do not have any respiratory symptoms, such as fever, cough, or runny nose, you do not need to wear a medical mask. When used alone, masks can give you a false feeling of protection and can even be a source of infection when not used correctly.

Now, as the number of deaths has surpassed 400,000 in the US, Dr. Jensen and lawmakers are calling for an audit of these deaths.  in the US they get $12,000 to $13,000 for patients admitted and testing positive for a COVID-19 diagnoses and another $39,000 again give or take, for those put on ventilators. Those number vary a bit from report to report.  If they have 161 covid patients, they get an extra $70,000 per patient. That one I just found out about via the video. Thank you Dr. Jensen. There should be an audit of deaths world wide, as death certificates were also changed in other countries as well. In the UK for example if you died 28 days after testing positive, you were counted as a covid death.  https://www.bitchute.com/video/kaRWlJ0RpYIN/  Las Vegas Schools Forced To Reopen Amid Rash Of Student Suicides  by Tyler DurdenTuesday, Jan 26, 2021 – 17:45  A surge of student suicides across Las Vegas has pushed the Clark County School District to reopen schools as soon as possible, according to NYTimes.  By December, eighteen students in the district had taken their own lives; an early-warning mental health system embedded within computers and tablets issued to students for remote learning received 3,100 alerts since schools shuttered their doors last March.  “When we started to see the uptick in children taking their lives, we knew it wasn’t just the Covid numbers we need to look at anymore,” said Jesus Jara, the Clark County superintendent.  “We have to find a way to put our hands on our kids, to see them, to look at them. They’ve got to start seeing some movement, some hope,” Jara said.  Efforts to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 across the country have led to drastic changes in the way children and teens learn and socialize.  Government data show a 24% increase in the number of children who arrived in emergency departments with mental health issues from mid-March through mid-October, compared with the same period in 2019.  Countrywide, tens of millions of students have been thrown into a new distance learning environment that has resulted in many extracurricular activities being canceled. Recreational spaces have closed, sports canceled, and playdates shifted to Zoom calls, resulting in many kids developing mental issues, especially in Clark County.  Clark County administrators had GoGuardian Beacon alert system installed on every device given out to students after the sixth student suicide last year. The system alerted administrators of more than 3,100 cases where a student searched suicide-related material between June and October.  In one instance, a 12-year boy searched “how to make a noose” on his iPad.” Administrators quickly reached out to the boy’s parents as he was about to hang himself.  The alerts have been so disturbing to Jara that he doesn’t sleep near his phone anymore.  “I can’t get these alerts anymore,” said Jara. “I have no words to say to these families anymore. I believe in God, but I can’t help but wonder: Am I doing everything possible to open our schools?”  Dr. Anthony Fauci has called for schools on a countrywide basis to reopen safely.  An indirect consequence of the pandemic and forcing children to learn at home has contributed to a rise of mental health issues and suicides among America’s future generation.

In a sweeping secret pardon that includes more than 2,616 BLM “protesters,” Biden gave a big eff you to law enforcement.  Biden’s pardon includes “anyone arrested for protesting in a non-violent manner.” Basically, all they have to do is say “I dint do nuffin” and they’re free to go.  According to the White House, there is no pardon, and the issue of BLM protesters has yet to be addressed at all. According to Communications Director, Art Tubolls, the whole thing has been blown out of proportion:  “More like…made up. There is no pardon for anyone because Trump’s federal goons never actually arrested anyone. They just dropped them off in the morning in front of the closest Circle K with $2 for a large coffee and a blintz.”  Fact-checkers were quick to point out that Circle K doesn’t sell blintzes.  At any rate, the pardons may not be real to some people, but to those of us who believe Joe Biden is the next coming of the antichrist here to unseat Donald Trump and thrust America into the pits of hell, they’re as real as can be, and we won’t stand for it.  A source close to the President said the pardons may not exist, but that Biden was “very proud” to be able to sign them. Whether or not he signed them virtually or just in spirit remains to be seen. One thing is for sure: our streets are a little less safe today with Biden issuing — or not — pardons for nearly 3000 criminals.

182,195189102587797754971974785843520314580,"Constitutional Attorney Matthew DePerno is an American hero. Two weeks ago, Michigan 13th Circuit Court Judge Kevin A Elsenheimer agreed to allow Mr. DePerno’s client, William Bailey, and a highly skilled team of IT experts to perform a forensic examination on 16 of the Dominion voting machines in Antrim County. On Monday, Judge Elsenheimer agreed to allow the results of the forensic examination to be released to the public. The results were damning.  THE REPORT:  After the forensic examination of 16 Dominion Voting machines in Antrim, Co., MI, Allied Security Operations Group has concluded that the Dominion Voting machines were assigned a 68.05% error rate. DePerno explained that when ballots are put through the machine, a whopping 68.05% error rate means that 68.05% of the ballots are sent for bulk adjudication, which means they collect the ballots in a folder. “The ballots are sent somewhere where people in another location can change the vote,” DePerno explained. The allowable election error rate established by the Federal Election Commission guidelines is 1 in 250,000 ballots or .0008%.  Based on the Allied Security Operations report, Constitutional Attorney Matthew DePerno states: “we conclude that The Dominion Voting System should not be used in Michigan. We further conclude that the results of Antrim County should not have been certified.  The stunning report was widely criticized by the Democrat Party mainstream media and by the dishonest Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson.  TRENDING: ""I Went There for You My Son"" - J6 Political Prisoner Chris Quaglin Was Brutally Beaten in Jail and Denied Celiac-Safe Food - Here Is His Heartfelt Letter to His Son on His First Birthday -- Please Donate  Following the bombshell findings by Mr. DePerno and his team of IT experts, a “risk-limited audit” was ordered by Sec. of State Benson. Constitutional Attorney Matt DePerno was invited to observe the “risk-limiting audit” of Antrim County’s vote that took place yesterday in the Kearney Twp. hall in Bellaire, MI., where 6 officials from the Secretary of State continuously walked around the room observing and correcting the counters who dared to stray from their objectives.  According to Verified Voting: The risk-limiting audit process can be conducted on any set of paper ballots that has a record of the number of ballots cast, how they are stored, and how to retrieve any particular ballot (ballot manifest). For an RLA to meaningfully support confidence in the reported election outcome, the standard is higher, and requires the following:  Paper ballots preferably marked by hand and supplemented with a ballot marking device for those who need to use one.  A deliberate and intentional step for a voter to check the paper ballot for accuracy before casting the ballot (voter verification).  Rigorous ballot accounting and a properly maintained chain of custody of the ballots.  If photographic evidence proves seals on the Dominion voting machines were broken on November 27, how can a “properly maintained chain of custody of ballots” be assured. The answer is, it can’t.  Before her so-called audit was completed, Sec of State Benson explained the purpose of the “risk limited audit” to the media while ensuring the integrity of the elections in Michigan:  “While we know the machine tabulators functioned properly in Antrim, we are conducting this audit to assure the public of what countless officials from both parties at the federal, state and local levels have already confirmed – that this was the most secure election in our nation’s history and the certified results are an accurate reflection of the will of the voters,” adding, “It is time for Michigan, and the nation to once and for all dismiss the meritless disinformation campaign that seeks to undermine the integrity of our election and move forward in support of our collective democracy.”  Mr. DePerno, who acted as an observer to the “risk-limited audit,” doesn’t agree with Ms. Benson about the integrity of Michigan’s election and has provided us with video and photographic evidence to prove that he was again able to debunk her statement about the “most secure election in our nation’s history.”  The first video provided by Matthew DePerno shows a bin of ballots from Mancelona Township, Precinct #1. The bin was delivered to three of the 20 bi-partisan volunteers that included several Antrim Co. city clerks who agreed to assist with the “risk-limited audit.”  Inside the bin, tabulated ballots were mixed in with ballots that were never tabulated, and several blank ballots were mixed in as well. Mr. DePerno referred to the bin of ballots as “an absolute mess!” On December 16, we reported about photographs taken at Mancelona Township’s Precinct #1 on November 27, 2020, that showed both of the security seals on the Dominion Voting machine were missing.  The second video was taken at a table where ballots were being counted in Helena Twp. The volunteers can be seen questioning why there were fewer ballots in the bin than the original number that was recorded in the previous recount? Shortly after asking the question, a male SOS official approached the table with a bag marked “spoiled ballots” and told them to count them. ATtorney Matt DePerno witnessed the unidentified male SOS rep pulling the “spoiled ballot bag out of the bin and delivering it to the volunteers who were “auditing” the ballots. DePerno also witnessed the SOS official telling them to add the “spoiled ballots” to the count.  The third video was taken at a table where the ballots from Central Lake Twp. were being counted. In the video, a male counter can be seen questioning “multiple ballots with the same signature.” According to Matthew DePerno, 138 ballots had write-in-votes where the penmanship was exactly the same.  In the video below, the SOS official can be seen demanding that the counters ignore what they believe is voter fraud and count the ballots.  “We need to do the counts because if we don’t have the counts, then we can’t move forward. And we understand that there is a concern with this precinct—but this is not a time for you to be investigating right now.”  “Did you find something else?” the male counter asks.  “No,” she replies, adding, “So, you need to move forward with the audit, so we can get the numbers, so we can see how many ballots are here.”  The female counter asks, “So when we’re done with the audit, there’s still the opportunity to challenge the fact that we have multiple ballots with the very same signature?” she asks.  “I don’t know if ‘challenge’ is the right word,” the SOS official says.  “But we’re challenging—” the volunteer says.  The male volunteer tells the SOS, “We’ll go ahead and count the ballots moving forward, but we will separate out, and count those— there’s going to be an asterisk, saying ‘these ballots have the same signature.'”  “And again, we know that you have a concern with this precinct,” she tells them, explaining, “That’s not your role at this very moment,” as she continues to push for them to ignore the multiple matching signatures and only count the ballots.  “What I need you to do right now is finish the audit,” she tells them again. Both of the volunteers explain that they are going to make a note of the ballots, to which the SOS official replies, “Again, that is not the process.”  The SOS official implores them to continue to count the presidential ballots.  At no point does the SOS official assure them that the issue of the multiple potentially fraudulent ballots will be addressed, but instead demands that they count them as if they were all legitimate ballots.  In this video, the SOS official can be seen telling the volunteers who are objecting to adding the ballots in question to the vote total, “This is not an investigation right now!”  On December 16, one day after Dominion Voting Systems CEO John Poulos testified in front of the MI Senate Oversight Committee, Mr. DePerno contacted us to say Poulos was incorrect in his statement that the ballots were securely stored. In fact, Mr. Derno provided us with photos showing seals were broken on one of the tabulators. DePerno explained, “In Central Lake, the lock that protects the side data port where you can insert a thumb drive in order to perform a software upgrade, that could change the program, was missing.” He explains, “The missing lock gives the ability of any person, including a voter to change the Dominion Voting machine program.”  Mr. DePerno explained to us that once the seals are broken, and the lock is removed, the integrity of the machines has been compromised. “It definitely showed that someone had accessed the inside of the tabulator, and it no longer represents a secure voting platform,” DePerno said.  The bin (or box) seen in the image below is where the ballots are stored. DePerno explained, “If you remove the tape, it gives you the ability to separate the tabulator from the box that contains the ballots.”  The photo below shows the stack of ballots in Central Lake that were cast for Joe Biden. The ballots that are pulled forward are all ballots that the counters pulled forward after objecting to the legitimacy of the ballots.  Mr. DePerno was stunned by the number of blank ballots that were mixed in with actual ballots, saying that he believes he observed more blank ballots in the recount than there are registered voters in Antrim County.  DePerno told us, “The guidelines from RLA were not followed. What they did yesterday was not an audit under those guidelines. It was a hand recount of the presidential race only and failed to address many of the problems with down-ballot races. Members of the public who assisted in the hand recount were not allowed to ask any questions or question any ballots. This hand recount also failed to address any of the glaring problems from the erroneous counts conducted on November 3 and November 6. Yesterday was nothing more than political theatre designed to allow the Secretary of State to again publish the same false narrative to the Michigan voters. Yesterday, when the people conducting the count dared ask questions, they were shut down.”  DePerno’s forensic and photographic evidence should be enough to call the entire Michigan election into question. Will the media or the courts care, or have we now entered a period in our nation’s history where we have officially become a Banana Republica after decades of Republicans ignoring the corruption of our media and our judicial system.",MI Sec of State Official Caught On Video Telling Volunteers To Count “Multiple Ballots with the very Same Signature” During “Audit” Of Votes In Antrim County,false
183,167099705799622283015006314379141300911,"% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.      Joe Biden’s Inauguration has been cancelled, President Trump would remain in office and the Chinese Communist Party propaganda media outlets of ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox News, CNN and MSNBC would soon be off the airwaves according to President Trump.  “I have invoked the Insurrection Act of 1807 (Section 10 U.S. Code 13 251-255) to address the treasonous rebellion conducted by Democrat and Republican lawmakers, CCP Agents (Chinese Communist Party), FBI, Department of Justice, CIA and others to dismantle the United States of America and it’s Constitution,” President Trump declared on Thursday 14 Jan. “These entities pose a direct threat to national security. I will remain President indefinitely until all domestic enemies are arrested.”  President Trump invoked the Insurrection Act after another assassination attempt on him last Sat. morning 9 Jan. According to his Intel, Chinese Communist Party Agents, the FBI, Department of Justice, CIA and others of the Deep State have – with the help of the Main Stream Media – long been planning to dismantle the US and it’s Constitution.  Of course, none of these treasonous acts have been reported by the corrupt Main Stream Media. Trump had evidence that the MSM was “embedded with CIA and Chinese Communist Party agents whose sole purpose was to direct public opinion toward a Deep State agenda.”  During President Trump’s four years in office he and what has been referred to as the Alliance have been fighting this Cabal – a Satan worshipping force composed of thirteen Satanist Bloodline families out of Italy, the Vatican, UK Monarchy, British M16, Chinese Communist Party, CIA, FBI, Department of Justice, Antifa, Black Lives Matter and certain Republican and Democratic Lawmakers. Another attempt on his life was the last straw.  Since that Sat. 9 Jan. the US has been under an abbreviated Martial Law with President Trump as Commander in Chief and General Flynn in charge of the Military. As such Trump has signed multiple Executive Orders that among other powers, allowed for Military arrests and Tribunals.  Soon to be acted upon were well over 222,286 sealed indictments against political and global elites filed in federal courts across the nation.  https://operationdisclosure.blogspot.com/2021/01/sealed-indictments-as-of-december-31.html#more  By law with the Insurrection Act in effect, Trump would remain President indefinitely until all domestic enemies were arrested. He would soon take down the Main Stream Media.  “I’m drafting an Executive Order to take the following propaganda media outlets off the airwaves: ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox News, CNN and MSNBC. I am also working with the FCC to pull their licenses. We have evidence that all of these media organizations employ agents of the Chinese Communist Party as well as embedded CIA Agents whose sole purpose is to brainwash, hypnotize and direct public opinion toward certain agendas that support the Left and Deep State. These organizations are a threat to national security and virtually nothing they report is actual news.”  It’s no small task to take down the Cabal. Military and Special Forces units have been deploying all over the US in 400+ cities. Right now there were over 15,000 troops in DC according to Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy. Special Forces units have covertly infiltrated Antifa and Black Lives Matter and made silent covert arrests.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4_DNABtptU  That same Sat. 9 Jan. POTUS and the Department of Defense postponed the 20 Jan. Presidential Inauguration. Intel sources claimed that if Joe Biden was not inaugurated there were corrupt-FBI plans to help stage Antifa and BLM violence in DC and at the 50 state capitols from Sat 16 Jan. through Wed. 20 Jan. Biden couldn’t be inaugurated anyway because of the Insurrection Act that demanded Trump remain in office “until all domestic enemies were arrested.”  A corrupt Mass Media has refused to report anything but their Left Wing agenda believed paid for by the CCP. Thus, the President has announced he would soon activate the Emergency Broadcast System (EBS). This was expected during what has been referred to as Ten Days of Darkness, or media outage.  With the EBS everyone would get alerts on their phones, TV, radio and Internet that would override other broadcasts for several hours at a time. The broadcasts would explain the silent war happening across the globe between the Cabal and Alliance.  This week Trump Intel providers Robert David Steele and Juan OSavin explained, “This may not be settled until April 1. Anyone including Fox, who refuses to broadcast the President of the US faces loss of their FCC licenses as well as criminal punitive actions, perhaps a military takeover.”  On Wed. 13 Jan. in an urgent message to the American people President Trump called for peace. Intel sources were reporting that riots were planned in DC and across the nation. He condemned the rioters at the state capitol, as well as a recent assault by Social Media on our Freedom of Speech and then activated military forces to quell unrest.  https://trendingpolitics.com/breaking-president-trump-releases-urgent-video-message-to-the-american-people/  The recent violation of Social Media platforms to censor Freedom of Speech was of concern. Donald Trump Jr. to the rescue. Trump Jr. announced that a new social media platform was coming soon called the Freedom Social Network.  More important, President Trump had officially shut down the Cabal’s USA Inc. and re-started a restored Republic on 4 July 2020.  https://web.archive.org/web/20110720183531/http://reality-bytes.hubpages.com/hub/The-Corporation-Of-The-United-States-Of-America  It was all a part of the Alliance’s Plan to free the globe of the Communist Parties /Cabal’s suppression of The People. “The Plan To Save The World”:  https://rumble.com/vagd07-q-the-plan-to-save-the-world-remastered.html  https://www.bitchute.com/video/qvfUkQTG5QHP/  As part of that plan President Trump’s Space Force has been involved in worldwide blackouts in multiple countries as Alliance Special Force units made arrests. Overnight to Sun. 10 Jan. multiple arrests were conducted, including in Frankfurt Germany – home of the CIA office where Dominion Voting machines illegally changed Trump votes to Biden in the 2020 Election.  Over last weekend French and Russia Alliance military leaders’ Special Force units took out Deep Staters in Italy, Pakistan, Berlin and Paris. By the first of the week they had moved to Iran where they caused Blackouts in order to target global and regional terrorism.  By Tues. 12 Jan. the White House had launched the National Artificial Intelligence Initiative Office. This officially activated Space Force and it’s Quantum Computer that would put us and the world on the Gold Standard, provide a transparent and instantaneous Quantum Voting System for our first Restored Republic Election in March 2021, plus provided the platform for a top secret Global Broadcast Satellite Program that could override all TV screens for President Trump’s worldwide addresses.  During this coming weekend to 20 Jan. there may be food and supply shortages, on-off outages of communication, media and social media, plus ATM and credit card transaction disruptions. You were advised to be prepared.  The Alliance was composed of President Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese President Xi Jinping, Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa Al-Kadhimi, India Prime Minister Narendra Modi, White Hats in the Department of Defense headed by Secretary of Defense Chris Miller, Undersecretary of Defense Intel Ezra Cohen Watnick and Gen.

Berger, Commandant of the United States Marine Corps., refused House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s request to use the Corps. to safeguard Biden’s Jan. 20 inauguration from Trump supporters and insurrectionists.  A Pentagon source speaking under promise of anonymity told Real Raw News that Pelosi contacted Gen. Berger late Monday night, and she beseeched him to commit 5,000 troops to help ensure a peaceful transition of power and to prevent a repeat of the Jan 6 siege of the Capitol. Gen. Berger, our source said, didn’t understand why Pelosi needed additional soldiers to augment an already impressive force assembled by federal and state officials. That force includes 15,000 National Guard from D.C., Delaware, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island, and an undisclosed number of FBI and DHS agents who arrived in D.C. Sunday night.  Pelosi said she wanted “battle ready” reinforcements because “radicalized Trump supporters and kooky Qanon conspiracy people” were about to converge on D.C. She implored him to reconsider, arguing that it was the general’s patriotic duty to quell uprisings and guarantee Biden’s ascension to the Oval Office.  Her statement made the general explode, our source said.  “Don’t lecture me on patriotism, Madam Speaker. I’ve served this country with distinction for 40 years. I’ve spilled blood for our nation. What have you, a self-serving elected official, done for your country?” Gen. Berger said.  Pelosi further enraged him by saying he was answerable to Congress.  “I answer only to the president, and as I understand it, Donald J. Trump is still president and commander-in-chief. I abide in the Constitution as it was written, not your interpretation of it,” Gen. Berger admonished Pelosi.  Quoting our source, “When her intimidation tactic failed to sway Gen. Berger, Pelosi tried a different tactic: Begging and flattery.”  Pelosi claimed that the National Guard’s “weekend warriors” were ill-prepared to repel an army of “mad Trumpists.” Battle-hardened marines, however, were more capable of defeating “rabble rousers,” she said. “You have the best trained soldiers in the world, and America needs them.”  Gen. Berger was unmoved. The only way Marines would be deployed, he told her, was if President Trump himself issued that order.  “If you want us to help combat his supporters, I suggest you get him on the phone and tell him that. If he orders me to, I will. Otherwise, I suggest you listen really hard to the words escaping your cracked, poisonous lips; they’re tantamount to treason. We don’t work for you,” Gen.

IP addresses owned by Chinese telecom enterprise Huawei Cloud and Huawei’s headquarters hacked into IP addresses in Pennsylvania on November 3, 2020, the data analysis shows. A Huawei-owned IP address also hacked an IP address in Michigan.  IP addresses owned by Chinese state-owned telecommunications operator China Unicom also hacked into IP addresses in Pennsylvania on November 3.  IP addresses owned by Chinese internet provider ChinaNet hacked into IP addresses in Nevada on November 3, according to the data analysis.

Image: Alibaba founder Jack Ma (image credit Wikimedia Commons / World Economic Forum)  An IP address owned by Kaspersky Lab – Moscow hacked into an IP address in Michigan on November 3, according to the data analysis. Kaspersky is a Russian software and cybersecurity firm. Kasperky Lab was co-founded by Eugene Kaspersky and his now-ex-wife, Natalya Kaspersky.  Image: Eugene Kaspersky (L) and Natalya Kaspersky (R)  Eugene Kasperky, the CEO of Kaspersky Lab, served in the Soviet military intelligence service and is a graduate of The Technical Faculty of the KGB Higher School, now known as Institute of Cryptography, Telecommunications and Computer Science, part of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation, widely known as the FSB.  Natalya Kaspersky is now the CEO of Russia’s InfoWatch Group and has a reported net worth of $270 million. “Natalya Kaspersky’s Snoop-Proof Phone Helps Putin Thwart Spies,” according to Bloomberg.  President Trump banned Kaspersky from all U.S. government networks when he signed the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). “The ban, included as part of a broader defense policy spending bill that Trump signed, reinforces a directive issued by the Trump administration in September that civilian agencies remove Kaspersky Lab software within 90 days,” Reuters reported on December 12, 2017. “The law applies to both civilian and military networks.” U.S. District Court Judge for the U.S. District of the District of Columbia Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, former Presiding Judge of the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA Court), upheld President Trump’s ban after Kaspersky Labs sued the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.  “Christopher Krebs, a senior cyber security official at the Department of Homeland Security, told reporters that nearly all government agencies had fully removed Kaspersky products from their networks in compliance with the September order,” according to the Reuters report. President Trump “terminated” Krebs in mid-November 2020 after Krebs claimed the 2020 election was the most secure election in history.  An IP address owned by the University of Stuttgart, a research university in Germany, also hacked into an IP address in Michigan on November 3, according to the analysis.  Amazon Data Services in Toronto, Canada owns an IP address that hacked into a Michigan IP address on November 3, according to the analysis.  Dominion Voting Services is based in Toronto.

186,105625103119574386858328487241855757744,"During the predawn hours on New Year’s Day, Delta Force operators infiltrated a Biden-controlled stronghold in southeast Ukraine near the port city of Mariupol, according to an anonymous White House Source who said President Trump greenlit the operation following a series of telephone calls to US military commanders and to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.  A Delta detachment, known as 1-SFOD in the Special Operations community, flew from Okinawa Japan to the US Embassy in Kyiv and held position there until Trump cleared the incursion with his Ukrainian counterparts.  Reliable sources said the Trump administration had obtained “credible evidence” that the Biden family, by proxy, owned a 200-acre estate and office building 50km northwest of Mariupol. On paper the property was owned by Paradigm Global Advisors, a hedge fund firm in which the Bidens have controlling interest. In the late summer of 2006 Joe Biden’s son Hunter and Joe’s younger brother, James, bought the firm. On the first day on the job, they showed up with Biden’s other son, Beau, and three large men and fired Paradigm’s president and 95% of staff, according to a Paradigm executive who was present. After that, much of Paradigm’s overseas ventures went dark but continued to rake in hefty profits despite a conspicuous lack of investors.  In June 2009 Washington Free Beacon writer Thomas Breslin opined the following statement: “Paradigm is hardly a reputable company. The Bidens fired everyone and put their own people in place. The company became nothing less than a slush fund for illicit monies that the Bidens laundered through the place.”  The Trump administration has spent four years ferreting out the truth behind Paradigm Global Advisors, according to our White House informant.  “After years of digging, Trump finally caught a break. A current Paradigm employee—someone the Biden’s fucked over—came forward with enough evidence for Trump to make this move. I don’t know what specific evidence was presented, but it must have been some heavy-hitting stuff for Trump to call on Delta to take care of it.”  At 3am on New Year’s Day, three Blackhawk helicopters, including decoy aircraft, airlifted Delta from Kyiv to the drop zone. The team found the office building empty, devoid of life. The unit commander described the building as “frigid,” as if it had been vacant and without heat for a long time.  “The windows were covered in a hoarfrost glaze, and the place had a catacomb chill about it,” he was quoted as saying. “Every office had been stripped—no chairs, no desks, no computers, no nothing. No electricity.”  Although the building was long deserted, Delta found evidence of recent activity within the hacienda attached to the compound. In a kitchen were freshly chopped vegetables and a percolator of lukewarm coffee. Outside, fresh tire impressions led away from the compound. It was as if someone had tipped off the occupants.  But in the hacienda Delta hit paydirt. They seized several laptops and 300 million dollars in gold bullion. They also found crates of Chinese-manufactured Type 56 assault rifles and tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition. Even more disturbing, they found beneath the hacienda a maze of chambers and tunnels that ran for miles in every direction. Ankle and wrist shackles, bolted to the walls in various locations, held bits of necrotic flesh, and in an antechamber, they discovered twelve duffel bags filled with black tar heroin.  On Trump’s order, Delta coordinated with Ukraine’s SBU, that nation’s security agency in counterintelligence and combatting terrorism, to confiscate evidence and await the arrival of State Department personnel.  This is a developing story and will be updated as is appropriate.  (Visited 754,382 times, 85 visits today)",Delta Force Raids Biden Compound in Ukraine,false

CDC illegally inflated the COVID fatality number by at least 1,600 percent as the 2020 presidential election played out, according to a study published by the Public Health Initiative of the Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge. The study, “COVID-19 Data Collection, Comorbidity & Federal Law: A Historical Retrospective,” was authored by Henry Ealy, Michael McEvoy, Daniel Chong, John Nowicki , Monica Sava, Sandeep Gupta, David White, James Jordan , Daniel Simon, and Paul Anderson. (READ THE LANDMARK RESEARCH HERE)  The CDC is now legally requiring red-blooded Americans to wear face masks on all public transportation as globalists try to push the concept of “double-masking” on the populace. Since the election, the World Health Organization admits that PCR tests are not totally reliable on the first try and a second test might be needed. This corresponds with CDC’s quiet admission that it blended viral and antibody test results for its case numbers and that people can test positive on an antibody test if they have antibodies from a family of viruses that cause the common cold. Hospitals in Florida had so many accuracy complications that Orlando Health had to admit that its 9.4 percent positivity rate got recorded at 98 percent. (READ: The TRUTH About Fauci and Gates And NIH Owning A Stake in the Vaccine).  ADVERTISEMENT  “The groundbreaking peer-reviewed research…asserts that the CDC willfully violated multiple federal laws including the Information Quality Act, Paperwork Reduction Act, and Administrative Procedures Act at minimum. (Publishing Journal – Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge / Public Health Policy Initiative) Most notably, the CDC illegally enacted new rules for data collection and reporting exclusively for COVID-19 that resulted in a 1,600% inflation of current COVID-19 fatality totals,” the watchdog group All Concerned Citizens declared in a statement provided to NATIONAL FILE, referring to the Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge study.  “The research demonstrates that the CDC failed to apply for mandatory federal oversight and failed to open a mandatory period for public scientific comment in both instances as is required by federal law before enacting new rules for data collection and reporting. The CDC is required to be in full compliance with all federal laws even during emergency situations. The research asserts that CDC willfully compromised the accuracy and integrity of all COVID-19 case and fatality data from the onset of this crisis in order to fraudulently inflate case and fatality data,” stated All Concerned Citizens.  “On March 24th the CDC published the NVSS COVID-19 Alert No. 2 document instructing medical examiners, coroners and physicians to deemphasize underlying causes of death, also referred to as pre-existing conditions or comorbidities, by recording them in Part II rather than Part I of death certificates as “…the underlying cause of death are expected to result in COVID-19 being the underlying cause of death more often than not.” This was a major rule change for death certificate reporting from the CDC’s 2003 Coroners’ Handbook on Death Registration and Fetal Death Reporting and Physicians’ Handbook on Medical Certification of Death, which have instructed death reporting professionals nationwide to report underlying conditions in Part I for the previous 17 years. This single change resulted in a significant inflation of COVID-19 fatalities by instructing that COVID-19 be listed in Part I of death certificates as a definitive cause of death regardless of confirmatory evidence, rather than listed in Part II as a contributor to death in the presence of pre-existing conditions, as would have been done using the 2003 guidelines. The research draws attention to this key distinction as it has led to a significant inflation in COVID fatality totals. By the researcher’s estimates, COVID-19 recorded fatalities are inflated nationwide by as much as 1600% above what they would be had the CDC used the 2003 handbooks,” stated All Concerned Citizens.  “Then on April 14th, the CDC adopted additional rules exclusive for COVID-19 in violation of federal law by outsourcing data collection rule development to the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE), a non-profit entity, again without applying for oversight and opening opportunity for public scientific review. On April 5th the CSTE published a position paper Standardized surveillance case definition and national notification for 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) listing 5 CDC employees as subject matter experts. This key document created new rules for counting probable cases as actual cases without definitive proof of infection (section VII.A1 – pages 4 & 5), new rules for contact tracing allowing contact tracers to practice medicine without a license (section VII.A3 – page 5), and yet refused to define new rules for ensuring that the same person could not be counted multiple times as a new case (section VII.B – page 7),” stated All Concerned Citizens.  ADVERTISEMENT  “By enacting these new rules exclusively for COVID-19 in violation of federal law, the research alleges that the CDC significantly inflated data that has been used by elected officials and public health officials, in conjunction with unproven projection models from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), to justify extended closures for schools, places of worship, entertainment, and small businesses leading to unprecedented emotional and economic hardships nationwide. A formal petition has been sent to the Department of Justice as well as all US Attorneys seeking an immediate grand jury investigation into these allegations,” All Concerned Citizens stated.

NIAID director Dr. Anthony Fauci, a financial ally of Bill Gates whose institute is part of NIH, has been critical of Hydroxychloroquine and the FBI even raided a health spa serving intravenous vitamin C, which are competitors to a vaccine. (RELATED: Eight NIH Coronavirus Panel Experts Disclose Financial Relationships With Price-Hiking Drugmaker Gilead).  “We do have some particular stake in the intellectual property” for the Moderna vaccine stated Francis Collins, the director of NIH, in a revelatory recent Economic Club panel discussion. “One of the vaccines– the one that’s furthest along– what started, actually, at the federal government in our own Vaccine Research Center at NIH– then worked with a biotechnology company called Moderna to get to where we are now, with very impressive Phase I results and getting ready to go into a large-scale trial as early as July. That one, of course, we do have some particular stake in the intellectual property. Others, though, come from companies who’ve invested their efforts into getting them to the point where they might now be ready for a trial,” Collins stated.  Newly published documents from Public Citizen have massive implications. Public Citizen states:  “The U.S. government may jointly own a potential coronavirus vaccine. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has played a critical role in coronavirus research for years. Building off this work, federal scientists have helped design and test mRNA-1273—a vaccine candidate developed in partnership with Moderna.[2] The federal government has filed multiple patents covering mRNA-1273. In this report, we describe two patent applications that list federal scientists as co-inventors.[3] If the government successfully pursued its patent filings, the resulting patents would likely confer significant rights. We also review recently disclosed contracts between NIH and Moderna. The agreements suggest that NIH has not transferred its rights, but instead maintains a joint stake.”  Journalist Patrick Howley exposes the Coronavirus “Contact Tracing” program in the first-ever episode of NATIONAL FILE TV. Dr. Anthony Fauci funded the Coronavirus bat research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, believed to be the source of the outbreak, then the Political Class tried to suppress treatment as Fauci’s friend and associate Bill Gates prepared mass vaccinations and the economy got battered. And the whole episode was written out, planned, in advance.  Here is the remarkable true story:  Why did the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation fund research at MIT on how to implant people’s vaccination history under their skin? Why did Fauci meet with Bill Gates’ father, George Soros, and other globalist heavyweights all the way back in 2001? Why did the Stephen King-created television series The Dead Zone predict the Coronavirus outbreak — and a Chloroquine cure for it — back in 2003?  Why did Dr. Anthony Fauci’s NIAID fund the Coronavirus bat research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which President Trump and Secretary of State Pompeo and others have identified as the source of the worldwide outbreak?  https://twitter.com/HowleyReporter/status/1247613431617912832  WOW: A high-level source just sent me this photo, says that it shows Dr. FAUCI with George SOROS and Bill Gates' father among others.

It turns out the firm is a partner of Google, NATIONAL FILE has learned. MTX Group got the contract without conservative Republican Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick being “in the loop” to the decision process, and Patrick is just one of numerous policymakers questioning the company’s deal with the state, which authorizes MTX to serve as virus investigators charting people’s contacts and relationships. MTX has also partnered during the Coronavirus outbreak with New York State and built Contact Tracing technology employed in Georgia. So what’s really going on here? It turns out MTX is bigtime partners with Google:  I reported: Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Centers For Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) policy confirms that “Contact Tracing” data may be sent to the World Health Organization (WHO) and to law enforcement authorities “to place someone under quarantine or isolation.” The Contact Tracing records, stored at the CDC and elsewhere, can also be sent to the Department of Justice, State Department, Department of Homeland Security, congressional offices, and to various medical and legal departments and contractors. Democrats are currently seeking $100 billion in a bill that would authorize grants to conduct contact tracing at people’s homes. Meanwhile, Americans are fearing the political implications of contact tracing, considering that Chelsea Clinton is on the board of trustees of one official contact tracing group that has accepted large sums of money from Bill Gates and George Soros organizations.  HHS records show a System of Records Notice (SORN 09-20-0171) in the Federal Register marking the creation of the record system called “Quarantine- and Traveler-Related Activities, Including Records for Contact Tracing Investigation and Notification…” The records pertain to “Individuals subject to quarantine or isolation orders, ill travelers (i.e., passengers and crew), contacts of ill travelers, and/or individuals exposed or suspected of being exposed to serious communicable diseases.” The records include: “Passenger and crew manifests from conveyances carrying individuals subject to 42 CFR parts 70 and 71, case reports, illness response forms, medical assessments, medical records (including but not limited to clinical, hospital and laboratory data and data from other relevant tests), name, address, date of birth, and related information and documents collected for the purpose of carrying out agency responsibilities under sections 311 and 361-368 of the Public Health Services Act.” The records are being stored at: “Division of Global Migration and Quarantine, National Center for the Preparedness, Detection, and Control of Infectious Disease (NCPDCID), Coordinating Center for Infectious Diseases (CCID), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1600 Clifton Road, NE., Building 16; MS E03, Atlanta, GA 30333. Records may occasionally be stored at Quarantine Stations located at key ports of entry and at contractor sites.”  READ THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES PRIVACY GUIDELINES HERE (emphasis added):  “(1) Records may be disclosed to contractors to handle program work duties, performing many of the same functions as FTEs within DGMQ in situations where additional staff is required.

The March 27 memo written by Joshua D. Lenchus, shortly before he was named chief medical officer this month of Broward Health Medical Center, confirms that the process allows for a “Quarantine Order” to be issued for “Persons Under Investigation” who have not even tested positive. This scoop comes amid public outcry after we exposed Broward County Administrator Bertha Henry caught on tape discussing going into “family homes” and assisted living facilities to isolate people during the Coronavirus outbreak. Freedom protesters wielding petitions were shut out of the Broward Commissioners meeting on Tuesday.  Here is Broward County Administrator Bertha Henry discussing going into “family homes” to isolate people.  HERE IS THE MEMO ISSUED BY JOSHUA LENCHUS: browardorder  SOROS, GATES, AND CLINTONS  Partners in Health was recently selected by Massachusetts governor Charlie Baker to conduct Coronavirus “contact tracing,” a process that involves teams of investigators finding out who infected people have come into contact with. The group is already “training and deploying hundreds of contact tracers.” Some citizens fear the potential for mass surveillance posed by contact tracing, especially in light of a Democrat-introduced bill in Congress to authorize contact tracing “at individuals’ residences.” Partners In Health’s involvement will not assuage many fears, considering the group has received funding from George Soros and Bill Gates organizations and counts Chelsea Clinton on its board of trustees.  Partners in Health lists George Soros’ Open Society Foundations as an official partner, along with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Partners In Health lists Open Society Foundations on its 2015 annual report as a supporter to the tune of $1 million or above, along with the Gates Foundation. Chelsea Clinton serves on Partners in Health’s Board of Trustees, according to its 2019 annual report.  Partners in Health co-founder Paul Farmer’s achievement.org bio notes: “Farmer’s work attracted the support of philanthropists, including George Soros and Bill and Melinda Gates. In 2002, PIH received a $13 million grant from the Global Fund for improvements in the Cange complex. In 2005 the William J. Clinton Foundation funded a Partners in Health AIDS program in Rwanda.” Farmer and Chelsea Clinton did a Clinton Foundation podcast together in 2019.  In response to a 2007 tuberculosis outbreak in Africa, NBC News reported: “Soros’ Open Society Institute announced a $3 million grant to the non-profit organization Partners in Health and Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. The donation will be used to design a model project of community-based XDR-TB treatment in Lesotho. Once treatment guidelines are developed, experts hope the program will be adopted in other poor countries.”  Soros personally announced the grant and said he hoped it would spark a larger project. For this initiative, Partners In Health was cited by name in the propaganda book The Philanthropy of George Soros: Building Open Societies.  In 2011, International Women’s Health Coalition noted, “YP Foundation Founder to Join Paul Farmer, George Soros, at IWHC Gala.” Farmer was honored at the gala, which Guest of a Guest noted had David Rockefeller in attendance.  In 2014, Partners In Health co-founder Paul Farmer secured multi-million dollar Soros financing for a coalition project in Africa. Farmer was featured in an October 2014 video interview on Soros’ Open Society Foundations website, which stated, “In between trips to Liberia, Paul Farmer of Partners In Health visited Open Society’s offices to discuss his work on Ebola. Paul talked about the need to ensure sustainable health systems for people in nations where the virus has spread.” Farmer blasted “fear and conspiracy theories around fatal illnesses” in the video and talked about how to “attack” conspiracy theories with activism.  Forbes reported in September 2014: “There’s never been a connection between Ebola and first-rate medical care,” says Paul Farmer, the renowned co-founder of Partners in Health, before pointing out that none of the health care workers flown back to the U.S. for treatment have died. Could the answer to the outbreak lie in the care regiment for those afflicted?  We’ll soon find out. Farmer landed in Liberia this morning, at the center of a coalition quietly formed to specifically – and quickly – test that thesis. In the next few weeks, the Farmer group will open a top-notch treatment facility in one of Liberia’s most rural provinces, along with strategies designed to maximize its effectiveness.  “This has been coming together for years,” Farmer tells Forbes, a few hours before departing on the trip. “The Ebola crisis pushed it over the edge.”  The impetus for this coalition began with a meeting two weeks ago, convened by Farmer’s co-founder at Partners in Health, Jim Kim, who is now president of the World Bank. Attendees included Director-General Margaret Chan of the World Health Organization, Tom Frieden, Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Francis Collins, Director of the National Institute for Health. Dismayed by the global response – Kim told the group that the outbreak already ranks among the worst health crises in world history — Kim tabbed Farmer as the World Bank’s special Ebola advisor and also enlisted another attendee at the meeting, Raj Panjabi, who runs Last Mile Health in Liberia. (Full disclosure: Panjabi was mentored at last year’s Forbes 400 Summit on Philanthropy and I now chair the advisory board for Last Mile Health, which hires, trains and manages front-line health care workers in remote villages.)  George Soros’ Open Society Foundations quickly provided $4 million to fund this project. “The coalition got us a proposal the next day, they answered all our questions the day after, and we got them the funds they needed before the week was out,” says Chris Stone, the organization’s president. The project was appealing to Soros’ team because it features a local group familiar with the turf, an entrepreneurial mentality and the ability to scale.”  Forbes passage ends  Contact Tracers Exposed https://t.co/vv5pUJXyOo — Patrick Howley (@HowleyReporter) May 11, 2020  Meanwhile…  Prospective Coronavirus contact tracers in New York City are required to understand “institutional and structural racism” and to support immigrants and the LGBTQ community. The government is employing contact tracers to investigate who infected persons come into contact with, leading to civilian concerns that privacy is being attacked. (RELATED: Democrats Introduce Bill To Authorize Contact Tracing At People’s Homes).  A job posting on Columbia University School of General Studies states: “The Fund for Public Health in New York City (FPHNYC), in partnership with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH), is seeking contact tracers to perform case interviews and contact tracing to support the citywide COVID-19 response. using a trauma-informed, culturally respectful approach that builds trust and facilitates the free sharing of information.” The job includes “Conducting in-person investigations into congregate settings and selected cases and contacts.”  Listed requirements include: “Ability to understand the concepts of institutional and structural racism and bias and their impact on underserved and underrepresented communities” and “Have a demonstrated commitment to supporting communities who have experienced systemic oppression and bias (e.g. people of color, LGBTQ people, immigrants, justice involved persons, etc.)”  Democrat Rep. Bobby Rush has introduced a bill in Congress to authorize the federal government to grant approved entities the right to conduct contact tracing for Coronavirus at “individuals’ residences.” Contact tracing involves investigators tracing every interaction that infected people have.  Rep. Rush introduced HR 6666, “COVID-19 Testing, Reaching, and Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act” on May 1, 2020 and it has been referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. The bill has 45 co-sponsors. According to the text of the bill: “To authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services to award grants to eligible entities to conduct diagnostic testing for COVID-19, and related activities such as contact tracing, through mobile health units and, as necessary, at individuals’ residences, and for other purposes.”  People are concerned that the government might be angling to use contact tracing to remove people from their homes and place them in quarantine, after a Ventura County, California health official suggested doing just that (and later walked it back, though it’s unclear what his proposed policy actually is at this time).

Graham is fighting Democrat governor Kate Brown’s state government in an effort to re-open her business during the government-imposed Coronavirus lockdown. Graham’s crusade, predictably, is making her a target of the political establishment.  I led the way in exposing Child Protective Services with my 2019 investigative journalism series. I spotlighted the massive problems in Oregon, interviewing pro-life activist Heather Hobbs regarding her claim that a nurse targeted her with a vindictive CPS report in the hospital due to her pro-life conservative beliefs, and I showed how the Oregon Treasury invested in a foster care provider accused of lording over patient abuse.  Meanwhile: Washington state’s Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCFY, also known as “CPS” for “Child Protective Services”) posted a job listing for existing CPS workers to volunteer to supervise children in quarantine centers during the Coronavirus outbreak.  The job posting states: “DCYF is seeking current DCYF employees in King, Snohomish, and Benton counties to volunteer to supervise and support children and youth in Emergency Quarantine Centers. While this is a voluntary effort, you will be compensated four ranges (approximately 20%) above you current base salary while performing these duties, and return to your normal position and salary once concluded. We are looking for current DCYF Social Service Specialist 3’s to care for children who are either COVID-19 positive, or who may have been exposed to COVID-19. There are three locations…”  One of the listed locations, Cedar Springs Camp, clarified that they were falsely listed by the state of Washington as a quarantine center, and they asked the state to remove them. The job posting closed on May 11.  Responding to social media uproar, the Washington state’s DCYF put out a clarifying statement that the ad was only referring to children currently in the system. But their clarifying statement contradicts itself, at first stating that the quarantined children will be kids who have tested positive, and then stating that quarantined children will also be kids who may have been exposed to Coronavirus.  DCYF’s clarifying statement reads: “In light of some concerns from the public regarding two recent job postings by the Washington State Department of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF), the agency would like to clarify the intent of these job listings and address misinformation spreading as a result of the job description.  The job postings targeted current staff interested in Social Service Specialist 3 and Social Service Specialist 5 positions. The post prematurely included sites of potential locations in the community where we could house children in our legal care and authority who’ve tested positive for COVID-19 in the event that a placement home was not available. The facilities listed are not affiliated with DCYF and had not signed off on this job listing.  The listings have since been taken down to avoid further confusion.  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, DCYF began internal recruitment of social service specialists to care for foster children who are either COVID-19 positive or may have been exposed to COVID-19 in the event a placement home was not available.  To clarify, those facilities that ultimately open their doors to this effort would only house State-dependent children and youth in out-of-home care who due to being COVID positive or COVID exposed do not currently have a foster home available. These facilities are for this limited scope and not considered quarantine centers or intended for the general public.”  Meanwhile…  Multiple mothers have had their children taken away from them as a direct result of working in the medical profession during the Coronavirus outbreak. Will these disturbing cases register with our political leaders, who are voicing public calls to stand with our medical workers during the pandemic?  Additionally, NATIONAL FILE caught a Child Protective Services worker attempting to use the Coronavirus outbreak to suspend all visits for parents of a child in the government system, citing a statewide policy that the state government says does not exist. What is going on?  (UPDATE: Dr. Theresa Greene, profiled below, got her children back after an appeals court ruling)  The Washington Examiner previously reported:  “A divorced emergency room physician temporarily lost custody of her daughter because of the coronavirus pandemic.  Dr. Theresa Greene, a doctor in South Florida, previously shared custody of her 4-year-old daughter with her ex-husband, Eric Greene, but a judge granted an emergency order granting him sole custody until the ordeal is over, according to NBC Miami.  In the court’s decision, Circuit Judge Bernard Shapiro wrote, “In order to protect the best interests of the minor child, including but not limited to the minor child’s safety and welfare, this Court temporarily suspends the Former Wife’s timesharing until further Order of Court. The suspension is solely related to the outbreak of COVID-19.”…  …Theresa Greene responded to the judge’s ruling by saying that “the family court system now is stressing me almost more than the virus.”  “I was just shocked that the judge would take this stance without talking to medical experts and knowing the facts and take it so lightly, take my child from me, and not think of the effect on her, her mental and psychological well-being,” she added.  The doctor noted that the custody battle will not stop her from following the “oath” she took to help people.”  Washington Examiner passage ends  Greene appealed the decision, and an appeals court ruled in her favor.  Meanwhile, I recently reported:  An Oklahoma medical worker has been stripped of her parental custody at this time because she works in a medical clinic and could possibly be exposed to Coronavirus during the outbreak, according to court documents.  A district judge for the Sac and Fox District Court took medical worker Katherine Spencer’s children after the father petitioned the court. “The Petitioner alleged, and submitted documents in support, that the Respondent alleged proximity to Coronavirus,” the court order states. Court dockets show no record of a hearing on March 20, the day the court laid down its order to confiscate Spencer’s children.  Katherine Spencer told her story on Facebook and denied that she has any history of “neglect” prior to getting hit with a gag order by the judge.  NATIONAL FILE recently reported…  UPDATE: Since NATIONAL FILE broke this story, the parents in question have had multiple short video visits with their daughter)  A Child Protective Services (CPS) worker in Oklahoma used the Coronavirus outbreak to cut off a mother and father’s visits with their 20-month old daughter, even though the Department of Human Services, the state agency that oversees CPS, claims to be keeping parental visits open.  “DHS statewide has suspended all visitations due to the virus so after today’s visit, we cannot approve any more visitations until it is reinstated,” said CPS permanency worker Danelle Dillman in a Friday morning text message to Andrew Ritter regarding his 20-month old daughter, who was seized by the government for “Failure To Thrive” due to low infant birth weight after the girl’s mother chose to breastfeed her. Ritter and his wife said they preferred not to place their daughter on a particular appetite enhancer due to perceived conflict with the girl’s Zyrtec Antihistemine.  An Oklahoma DHS official told National File in a confusing, defensive interview that the state agency does not have a policy in place to suspend all visitations at this time, but rather to continue visitations using technology like Skype and FaceTime. But the official does not know if visitations are actually still occurring. Ritter and his wife never received an offer to hold a cyber-visit. Here is the text that permanency worker Dillman sent to Ritter:  When National File called up the headquarters for Oklahoma DHS, a woman who answered the phone told us that parental visits were indeed “suspended” for the time being, “until they get this virus under control.” The woman refused to give us her name.  But Keeley McEwan, head of the Oklahoma DHS communications office, told National File that “We have not suspended visitation across the board in any way.” She pointed to the agency’s daily guidance for case workers, which she noted is “fluid” and “changes day to day.”  “As of today we are highly encouraging continuing visitation” utilizing iphones and programs including Skype and FaceTime. “Whether a visitation is cancelled is on a case by case basis.”  She did not know whether any visitations have been recently held since the Coronavirus outbreak using Skype or FaceTime. Permanency worker Danelle Dillman did not respond to repeated requests for comment. McEwan did not confirm whether or not she spoke to Dillman or Dillman’s superviser following our conversation.  I have been reporting on the nationwide scourge of CPS removing children from parents’ homes for highly disputable reasons or no reason at all, which many parents feel is due to the for-profit nature of the government’s child removal industry.  BUSTED: FAUCI, BIRX, AND GATES: HERE IS MY ORIGINAL REPORT THAT CHANGED THE WORLD  President Donald Trump is fighting to find a medical solution for Coronavirus in the short term, expressing hope that the anti-malaria drug Chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine can help patients suffering from the Chinese virus.  The truth is that President Donald Trump is locked in an intense power struggle with Bill Gates, who is pushing his vaccines, which may not be available to the public until after November’s election.  Gates has a lot of pull in the medical world, he has a multi-million dollar relationship with Dr. Fauci, and Fauci originally took the Gates line supporting vaccines and casting doubt on Chloroquine. Coronavirus response team member Dr. Deborah Birx, appointed by former president Obama to serve as United States Global AIDS Coordinator, also sits on the board of a group that has received billions from Gates’ foundation. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation recently provided funding to both IHME and Imperial College London, which put out wildly overblown models for the Coronavirus outbreak that caused mass panic and contributed to worldwide government lockdown. Gates is a big proponent for a population lockdown scenario for the Coronavirus outbreak.  National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID, a division of National Institutes of Health, NIH) director Dr. Anthony Fauci, who is represented by the Aurumn Speakers Bureau, initially criticized Trump’s hopeful assessment of Chloroquine, saying in an interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper that “There’s no magic drug for coronavirus right now,” and lectured, “Let me put it into perspective for the viewers .. there has been anecdotal non-proven data that it [chloroquine] works… but when you have an uncontrolled trial you can never definitely say that it works.”  Fauci then changed his tune and launched a public relations campaign huddling closer to Trump. Fauci said that he would definitely prescribe Chloroquine for patients. “Yeah, of course, particularly if people have no other option. These drugs are approved drugs for other reasons. They’re anti-malaria drugs, and they’re drugs against certain autoimmune diseases like lupus. Physicians throughout the country can prescribe that in an off-label way. Which means they can write it for something it was not approved for.”  Fauci makes his hostility toward the Trump-touted drugs clear:  First of all this is a brilliant idea @kilmeade to study how many people that’ve taken hydroxychloroquine long term have contracted #COVID maybe even have them take antibody test. Second of all Fauci doesn’t want it prescribed here but it’s fine if Spain does? pic.twitter.com/hcnRhos13g — Rosie memos (@almostjingo) April 3, 2020  Fauci is pushing the talking point that things will never go back to normal in our society until we have the ability to mass-vaccinate people, echoing Bill Gates’ assertion that mass gatherings in our culture “may not come back at all” before mass-vaccinations.  #NEW: Dr. Anthony Fauci on return to normalcy from pandemic: ""If 'back to normal' means acting like there never was a Coronavirus problem, I don't think that's going to happen until we do have a situation where you can completely protect the population.""pic.twitter.com/JbE7uasbO2 — Jennifer Franco (@jennfranconews) April 6, 2020  Fauci downplayed the threat of Coronavirus on January 21 in a Newsmax TV interview, saying, “This is not a major threat for the people in the United States, and this is not something that the citizens of the United States right now should be worried about.” Since then, Coronavirus has exploded in the United States, boosting demand for a vaccine.  This is Fauci 10 days before Trump's Travel Ban. pic.twitter.com/PU3AuDKctv — Justin Pulitzer Trades (@JustinPulitzer) April 7, 2020  Fauci later said that people would not have to change their daily activities as a result of the Coronavirus outbreak:  It is time to #firefauci Mr. President. The People Demand Ithttps://t.co/J4SSXn1kPB — Patrick Howley (@HowleyReporter) April 12, 2020  But Fauci’s NIAID actually funded a study on Bat Coronavirus, which was a project that included scientists at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, the Chinese lab at the center of controversy over their bat research. That study confirmed in 2018 that humans have died from coronavirus.  Here’s an excerpt from the April 4, 2018 NIAID website entry entitled “New Coronavirus Emerges From Bats in China, Devastates Young Swine”: “A newly identified coronavirus that killed nearly 25,000 piglets in 2016-17 in China emerged from horseshoe bats near the origin of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which emerged in 2002 in the same bat species. The new virus is named swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV). It does not appear to infect people, unlike SARS-CoV which infected more than 8,000 people and killed 774. No SARS-CoV cases have been identified since 2004. The study investigators identified SADS-CoV on four pig farms in China’s Guangdong Province. The work was a collaboration among scientists from EcoHealth Alliance, Duke-NUS Medical School, Wuhan Institute of Virology and other organizations, and was funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health. The research is published in the journal Nature. The researchers say the finding is an important reminder that identifying new viruses in animals and quickly determining their potential to infect people is a key way to reduce global health threats.”  Additionally, the Daily Mail reported that National Institutes of Health, of which Fauci’s NIAID is a member, provided a $3.7 million grant to the Wuhan Institute of Virology to study bat-borne coronavirus. That study was headlined, ‘Discovery of a rich gene pool of bat SARS-related coronaviruses provides new insights into the origin of SARS coronavirus.’  So what is really going on here?  The true behind-the-scenes story is coming to light:  Bill Gates Cast Doubt on Chloroquine And Said He Is Running A Study On It  Here is what Gates said regarding Chloroquine in a Reddit Ask Me Anything session:  “There are a lot of therapeutic drugs being examined. This is one of many but it is not proven. If it works we will need to make sure the finite supplies are held for the patients who need it most. We have a study going on to figure this out. We also have a screening effort to look at all the ideas for Therapeutics because the number being proposed is very large and only the most promising should be tried in patients. China was testing some things but now they have so few cases that that testing needs to move to other locations,” Gates said.  Gates Is Funding Coronavirus Vaccine Candidates That Would Compete With Chloroquine, And Dr. Fauci’s Agency Is Co-Partnering On The Project  The company Moderna is working on a Coronavirus vaccine, which they expect will go into clinical trials in April. Dr. Fauci has heaped praise on Moderna and said that a vaccine is the only way to definitively assure the end of the virus. Gates is working on multiple Coronavirus vaccine projects.  The New Eastern Outlook journal reported:  “Gates Foundation money is backing vaccine development on every front. Inovio Pharmaceuticals of Pennsylvania received $9 million from the Gates-backed CEPI, Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, to develop a vaccine, INO-4800, which is about to test on humans in April, a suspiciously rapid time frame. In addition Gates Foundation just gave the company an added $5 million to develop a proprietary smart device for intradermal delivery of the new vaccine.  In addition Gates Foundation monies via CEPI are financing development of a radical new vaccine method known as messengerRNA or mRNA.  They are co-funding the Cambridge, Massachusetts biotech company, Moderna Inc., to develop a vaccine against the Wuhan novel coronavirus, now called SARS-CoV-2. Moderna’s other partner is the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), a part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Head of NIAID is Dr Anthony Fauci, the person at the center of the Trump Administration virus emergency response. Notable about the Fauci-Gates Moderna coronavirus vaccine, mRNA-1273, is that it has been rolled out in a matter of weeks, not years, and on February 24 went directly to Fauci’s NIH for tests on human guinea pigs, not on mice as normal. Moderna’s chief medical adviser, Tal Zaks, argued, “I don’t think proving this in an animal model is on the critical path to getting this to a clinical trial…  Add to this the fact that the Gates Foundation and related entities such as CEPI constitute the largest funders of the public-private entity known as WHO, and that its current director, Tedros Adhanom, the first WHO director in history not a medical doctor, worked for years on HIV with the Gates Foundation when Tedros was a government minister in Ethiopia, and we see that there is practically no area of the current coronavirus pandemic where the footprints of the omnipresent Gates are not to be found. If that is to the good of mankind or grounds to be worried, time will tell.”  New Eastern Outlook journal passage ends  The Hill reported:  “Going into a Phase One trial within three months of getting the sequence is unquestionably the world indoor record. Nothing has ever gone that fast,” according to Fauci.  While it is uncertain that Moderna’s answer is the solution, Fauci notes that the only surefire way to stop an outbreak is to develop a vaccine. Moderna manufactures drugs around messenger RNA molecules that carry instructions to reprogram cells in the body to operate differently and beneficially. Currently, its genetic technology has not created a vaccine for humans.  The first study of the vaccine will take place at NIAID. If it is successful, a second trial would feature closer to hundreds of people. Pending the results of future studies and regulations, the vaccine may not be readily available until next year, Fauci said.  Hill passage ends  Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology News reported in 2016 on Gates’ relationship with Moderna:  “Moderna Therapeutics said today it received an initial $20 million grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to develop a new affordable combination of messenger RNA–based antibody therapeutics geared toward preventing HIV infection.  The grant is intended for use in the antibody combination’s preclinical study and a Phase I clinical trial. Gates Foundation’s $20 million funding could potentially grow into a total $100 million commitment—including the HIV antibody project—toward development of additional mRNA-based treatments for various infectious diseases, Moderna said.  “The foundation’s mission to help all people lead healthy and productive lives is well aligned with Moderna’s mission to deliver on the promise of transformative mRNA science to bring new medicines to patients,” Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel said in a statement.  Moderna said the development effort would be led by its infectious disease–focused venture company, Valera…”  Fauci Is Tight with Bill Gates  “He’s very good about not overpromising,” Gates said of Fauci in 2018 as Gates worked on a universal flu vaccine. NIAID Council minutes from 2019 show Fauci’s agency identifying a Gates Foundation workshop as being of interest. Gates met with Fauci in 2017 “to discuss research opportunities in global health.” In 2010, Fauci was named to the Leadership Council of the “Decade of Vaccines” Collaboration, which the World Health Organization, Fauci’s agency NIAID, UNICEF, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation convened.  Fauci delivered a keynote opening address on “The Challenge of Pandemic Preparedness” in Washington, D.C. at the October 2, 2017 Grand Challenges meeting, which is a project of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (Gates Foundation) will also contribute $100 million to the goal of advancing these potential cures, with an aim toward providing affordable, globally available treatment that will be accessible to patients in low-resource settings.  According to the NIH, the collaboration between the organizations will focus on 2 key areas. First, it will identify potential candidate cures for preclinical and clinical evaluation, and second, it will define long-term opportunities to partner with organizations in Africa…  “This collaboration is an ambitious step forward, harnessing the most cutting-edge scientific tools and NIH’s sizable global HIV research infrastructure to one day deliver a cure and end the global HIV pandemic,” said NIAID director Anthony S. Fauci, MD, in a statement announcing the initiative. “We are taking into account those with the greatest need at the foundation of this effort, to ensure that, if realized, this exceptional public health achievement will be made accessible to all.”  Dr. Fauci Is Slated to Speak At The World Vaccine Congress in September 2020 Alongside A Coterie of Public Sector and Private Sector Folks From WHO, CDC, FDA, Merck, Pfizer, etc.  The event is in Washington, D.C.

Deborah Birx Sits on the Board of The Global Fund, which is heavily funded by Bill Gates’ organizational network, as journalist Jordan Schactel discovered. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation gave the Global Fund a $750 million promissory note in 2012.

Fauci  Fauci was previously accused of a conflict of interest regarding one of his patents in 1999.  FAUCI’S FRIEND PELOSI GALLIVANTED AROUND CHINATOWN DURING THE OUTBREAK  Democrat House Speaker Nancy Pelosi impeached President Donald Trump during the spread of the Coronavirus outbreak in the United States of America, while also encouraging people to socialize with her in the Chinatown district of San Francisco, where she visited a fortune cookie factory to portray her supposed opposition to bigotry and xenophobia.  The CDC confirmed the first U.S. case of the Chinese virus on January 21, in Seattle from a man who got back from Wuhan, China. Incidentally, the House impeachment managers kicked off opening arguments in the Trump “Ukraine”-focused impeachment trial two days later on January 23.  Pelosi told people to “Come join us!” during her Chinatown jaunt on February 24, which featured her aforementioned fortune cookie factory visit.  This was on February 24.

National File reported:  Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi’s 1,119 page coronavirus stimulus proposal includes a vast amount of hidden, nakedly partisan political provisions and regulations that are unrelated to family and small business relief. Several sharp-eyed social media users who had the fortitude to browse through the massive bill found bizarre provisions, including writer Rachel Bovard. “Pelosi’s #COVID19 bill is 1,119 pages and contains provisions for “conducting risk-limiting audits of results of elections” so yeah it’s really very focused on the crisis at hand,” Bovard said in a thread that compiled screenshots of various provisions in the bill. After proposing a bailout for the postal service, the Democratic bill includes sections about paid studies of “pay equity” between “racial and ethnic minorities” and their “white counterparts,” as well as a “comparison of pay between and women for similar roles and assignments.”  GATES IS EVERYWHERE  The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation recently provided massive amounts of funding to both the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) and Imperial College in London, which both produced wildly incorrect models for the Coronavirus outbreak that sparked worldwide panic and provided false justification for government leaders to shut down the American economy, creating mass unemployment. Bill Gates is a vaccine oligarch who recently laughed at America’s economic devastation, so committed he is to his vision of vaccinating the world’s population and keeping society locked down until that becomes possible. Gates, like his crony Dr. Anthony Fauci, has fought the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat the virus and has claimed that society will never fully return to normal until a vaccine is ready. (READ: The Dark Truth About Fauci, Birx, Bill Gates and the Globalist Elites).  White House Coronavirus task force member Dr. Deborah Birx touted the IHME’s “Chris Murray Model” in April. IHME is housed at the University of Washington and was reportedly founded by the Gates Foundation, according to a Fox 9 report. In 2017, the Gates Foundation provided a ten-year, $279 million grant to IHME. Birx, meanwhile, sits on the board of the Global Fund, which has received more than $2 billion from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The IHME model proved to be a total disaster. In Georgia, where Republican governor Brian Kemp led the charge for re-opening his state, the model previously predicted 1,783 new cases per day on June 12 and hundreds of new cases per day into August. That model, just revised, shows 367 new cases per day on June 12 and zero new cases per day by August.  Deborah Birx, whose PA medical license is expired, used a bogus Gates-funded model to shut down the country, defended counting non-definitive cases as Coronavirus, sits on board of Global Fund which has taken more than $2 BILLION from Gates Foundation…https://t.co/DhgcEibTdD — Patrick Howley (@HowleyReporter) April 21, 2020  In March 2020, during the Coronavirus outbreak, the Gates Foundation awarded a more than $79 million grant to Imperial College London. The Imperial College London model, spearheaded by team leader Neil Ferguson, projected 2.2 million American casualties. The disastrous model led to Elon Musk lambasting Ferguson, who resigned as an adviser to the British government when he was caught flaunting the very lockdown that his numbers inspired. Imperial College London admits on its website that its research on arboviruses, which includes work on vaccine projections undertaken by Neil Ferguson himself is Gates-funded, stating, “Our research is funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the US National Institutes of Health and the MRC.” Business Insider reports that Neil Ferguson’s MRC Center for Global Infectious Disease at Imperial College “gets tens of millions of dollars in annual funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and works with the UK National Health Service, the US Centres for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC), and is tasked with supplying the World Health Organization with “rapid analysis of urgent infectious disease problems.” A job posting that opened in December 2019 and closed in January 2020 stated (emphasis added): “We are seeking an outstanding Research Lead for the Vaccine Impact Modelling Consortium (https://www.vaccineimpact.org/). This major collaborative initiative directed by Professor Neil Ferguson, is based within the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London and funded jointly by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance ($11 million over 2016-22).”  A Chinese government entity that has partnered with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation led a delegation of public health experts to the Wuhan Institute of Virology in December 2018, after the lab had already begun its bat coronavirus research funded by Dr. Anthony Fauci’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). This discovery was made by citizen journalist Amazing Polly (@99freemind). President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have emboldened the narrative that Coronavirus originated at the Wuhan lab.  The Chinese government’s Center for Global Public Health (CGPH) guided ten experts from Africa to the Wuhan lab and other Chinese institutions and reached a consensus on “training of biosafety personnel.” The information on the trip from Wuhan Institute of Virology’s website can be READ HERE. According to the website, “CGPH has managed and implemented foreign aid mission assigned by the National Health and Family Planning Commission and the Ministry of Commerce, as well as international cooperation projects funded by the United Kingdom Department for International Development and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.”","BUSTED: CDC Inflated COVID Numbers, Accused of Violating Federal Law",false

This appeared to be another solid win for President Trump in Michigan with a greater margin than his 2016 victory. The ballot counting in Detroit, Michigan on election night took place at the TCF Center, formerly known as Cobo Hall.  This is the site where Detroit City Officials put cardboard over the windows to prevent the GOP observers from seeing in, where poll workers were militantly hostile to the GOP observers, and where hundreds of affidavits by election observers claim they witnessed voter fraud.  At least three election observers testified in sworn affidavits that they witnessed vehicles delivering fraudulent ballots to the TCF Center early in the morning on November 4th.  TRENDING: LAWRENCE SELLIN: The Second American Civil War is Underway  Michigander Shane Trejo witnessed the 3:30 am Biden Ballot Drop that gave Joe Biden an outstanding lift. “There were thousands of ballots in each box,” Trejo says. “There were at least 50 boxes that I saw unloaded at 3:30 am, well after the 8:00 pm deadline for ballots to show up.”  The 3:30 am was the first ballot delivery since 10:30 pm when 138,000 ballots showed up suddenly. Shane later testified that he noticed that the city of Detroit Clerk’s Office and its emblem were written on the white van that showed up with the ballots. City Clerk Janice Winfrey‘s name was on the van and a number presumably for Janet Winfrey’s office. Trejo says the ballots could not be processed when they arrived, so by the time they were counted, a new shift of poll workers had come in for the day.  After these ballot drops Joe Biden took the lead in Michigan.  Shane Trejo explained how the timing was important. The Biden Ballot Drop took place at the end of one shift. The ballots were left uncounted. So when the new shift came to count ballots they didn’t know where the ballots had come from.  Trejo repeatedly asked about this truck to site supervisors and was STONEWALLED.  Former Michigan State Senator Pat Colbeck was also present at the TCF Center on the morning of November 4th. Senator Colbeck also witnessed the 3:30 am Biden Ballot Drop. Colbeck spoke with The Gateway Pundit back in November, “I went back there and I witnessed a mini-panel truck if you will with a Detroit Election Bureau regalia all over the side and a vehicle ID number on it… And inside of it, and this gets into some chain of custody discussions, there was no indication that there was a Republican and a Democrat (present) during transfer. We don’t know if they stopped by a sidestreet in Coney Island and picked up a few more ballots during transfer. We have no way of verifying any of that information.”  The authorities and media in Michigan were completely uninterested in following up on this shocking story.  Until today, no one has bothered to review the video footage from the TCF Center on election night.  The Gateway Pundit requested the TCF video back in December!  The TCF Center tried to quote us over $22,000 for one day’s worth of video.  We requested two hours of video.  Last Friday we were sent the requested video.  Since last week we have been combing through the hundreds of hours of security camera footage from the TCF Center on the morning of November 4th.  And what we found is a political bombshell.  ** At 3:23 AM The Gateway Pundit has exclusive video of a white van registered to the city of Detroit entering the gate into the TCF Center.  ** At 3:25 AM we discovered video from a second camera showing three individuals unloading over 50 boxes of ballots in a hallway inside the TCF Building and just outside the counting room.  ** The ballots were then wheeled away on carts into the ballot counting room.  ** The van is then seen on video leaving the center about 25 minutes later.  ** Then we saw the van returning an hour later, entering the TCF Center again and unloading more boxes of ballots.  ** The white van was escorted by a black sports car for both ballot deliveries.  ** The white van was allowed through an electronic gate to enter the TCF complex.  This is video proof of the fraud in Detroit, Michigan. It is exactly as the GOP observers described it to us back in November!  We have more damning video from the TCF Center to release in the coming days.

Ukrainian President Volodmyr Zelensky stated Friday that Russian forces are firing at “military installations” leaving analysts speculating that term could include US-installed and operated bio-labs.  According to US government documents, the US has multiple biolabs in Ukraine. In typical Pentagon fashion, these biolabs are marketed as “defense.“  Russia has been warning the US for months to stop operating dangerous biolabs on their doorstep. Mainstream media won’t touch the topic now, but they did cover the news in the past.  Four months ago, Russia and China asked the UN for the US to be “checked and limited” in biological capabilities.  Russia and China blamed the US for the Covid-19 outbreak and were fearful that the US had more bioweapons to be unleashed on the world.  How does this relate to Ukraine?  Putin has admitted he is engaged in a “special military operation” to demilitarize Ukraine. Mainstream analysts fail to understand the possible scope of this statement.  Meanwhile, the US embassy in Ukraine has just been caught attempting to scrub evidence of bioweapons laboratories operated by the US government on Ukrainian soil.  As we reported earlier, In the last 24 hours, the US embassy removed all PDF files from the embassy website here: https://ua.usembassy.gov/embassy/kyiv/sections-offices/defense-threat-reduction-office/biological-threat-reduction-program/  However, the internet sleuths archived the information before it could be memory-holed forever.

The researchers found that when the mRNA vaccine enters the human liver cells, it triggers the cell’s DNA, which is inside the nucleus, to increase the production of the LINE-1 gene expression to make mRNA.  The mRNA then leaves the nucleus and enters the cell’s cytoplasm where it translates into LINE-1 protein. A segment of the protein called the open reading frame-1, or ORF-1, then goes back into the nucleus where it attaches to the vaccine’s mRNA and reverse transcribes into spike DNA.  Reverse transcription is when DNA is made from RNA, whereas the normal transcription process involves a portion of the DNA serving as a template to make an mRNA molecule inside the nucleus.  “In this study we present evidence that COVID-19 mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 is able to enter the human liver cell line Huh7 in vitro,” the researchers wrote in the study, published in Current Issues of Molecular Biology. “BNT162b2 mRNA is reverse transcribed intracellularly into DNA as fast as 6 [hours] after BNT162b2 exposure.”  BNT162b2 is another name for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine that is marketed under the brand name Comirnaty.  The whole process occurred rapidly within six hours. The vaccine’s mRNA converting into DNA and being found inside the cell’s nucleus is something that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said would not happen.  “The genetic material delivered by mRNA vaccines never enters the nucleus of your cells,” the CDC said on its web page titled “Myths and Facts about COVID-19 Vaccines.”  This is the first time that researchers have shown in vitro or inside a petri dish how an mRNA vaccine is converted into DNA on a human liver cell line, and is what health experts and fact-checkers said for over a year could not occur.  The CDC says that the “COVID-19 vaccines do not change or interact with your DNA in any way,” claiming that all of the ingredients in both mRNA and viral vector COVID-19 vaccines (administered in the United States) are discarded from the body once antibodies are produced. These vaccines deliver genetic material that instructs cells to begin making spike proteins found on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19 to produce an immune response.  Pfizer did not comment on the findings of the Swedish study and said only that its mRNA vaccine does not alter the human genome.  “Our COVID-19 vaccine does not alter the DNA sequence of a human cell,” a Pfizer spokesperson told The Epoch Times in an email. “It only presents the body with the instructions to build immunity.”  More than 215 million or 64.9 percent of Americans are fully vaccinated as of Feb. 28, with 94 million having received a booster dose.  A 3D print of a spike protein of SARS-CoV-2—the virus that causes COVID-19—in front of a 3D print of a SARS-CoV-2 virus particle. (Courtesy of NIAID/RML)  Autoimmune Disorders  The Swedish study also found spike proteins expressed on the surface of the liver cells that researchers say may be targeted by the immune system and possibly cause autoimmune hepatitis, as “there [have] been case reports on individuals who developed autoimmune hepatitis after BNT162b2 vaccination.”  The authors of the first reported case of a healthy 35-year-old female who developed autoimmune hepatitis a week after her first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine said that there is a possibility that “spike-directed antibodies induced by vaccination may also trigger autoimmune conditions in predisposed individuals” as it has been shown that “severe cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection are characterized by an autoinflammatory dysregulation that contributes to tissue damage,” which the virus’s spike protein appears to be responsible for.  Spike proteins may circulate in the body after an infection or injection with a COVID-19 vaccine. It was assumed that the vaccine’s spike protein would remain mostly at the injection site and last up to several weeks like other proteins produced in the body. But studies are showing that is not the case.  The Japanese regulatory agency’s biodistribution study (pdf) of the Pfizer vaccine showed that some of the mRNAs moved from the injection site and through the bloodstream, and were found in various organs such as the liver, spleen, adrenal glands, and ovaries of rats 48 hours following injection.  In a different study, the spike proteins made in the body after receiving a Pfizer COVID-19 shot have been found on tiny membrane vesicles called exosomes—that mediate cell-to-cell communication by transferring genetic materials to other cells—for at least four months after the second vaccine dose.  The persistence of the spike protein in the body “raises the prospect of sustained inflammation within and damage to organs which express the spike protein,” according to experts at Doctors for COVID Ethics, an organization consisting of physicians and scientists “seeking to uphold medical ethics, patient safety, and human rights in response to COVID-19.”  “As long as the spike protein can be detected on cell-derived membrane vesicles, the immune system will be attacking the cells that release these vesicles,” they said.  Dr. Peter McCullough, an internist, cardiologist, and epidemiologist, wrote on Twitter that the Swedish study’s findings have “enormous implications of permanent chromosomal change and long-term constitutive spike synthesis driving the pathogenesis of a whole new genre of chronic disease.”  Whether the findings of the study will occur in living organisms or if the DNA converted from the vaccine’s mRNA will integrate with the cell’s genome is unknown. The authors said more investigations are needed, including in whole living organisms such as animals, to better understand the potential effects of the mRNA vaccine.  “At this stage, we do not know if DNA reverse transcribed from BNT162b2 is integrated into the cell genome. Further studies are needed to demonstrate the effect of BNT162b2 on genomic integrity, including whole genome sequencing of cells exposed to BNT162b2, as well as tissues from human subjects who received BNT162b2 vaccination,” the authors said.",Pfizer’s COVID-19 Vaccine Goes Into Liver Cells and Is Converted to DNA: Study,false
193,17061664237497551788510926774046859803,"Footage has emerged of Dr Tedros, the Director-General of the World Health Organization, claiming countries are intentionally giving booster shots of the Covid-19 vaccine to children to kill them.  Tedros was speaking at the hybrid press conference with Geneva based Palais des Nations journalists held on Monday 20th December 2021 when he made the following remarks –  “So if it’s going to be used (the Covid-19 vaccine) it’s better to focus on those groups of severe disease and death, rather as we see some countries are using to give boosters to kill children, this is not right.”  The strange slip comes after Dr Tedros was recorded speaking with Brazil’s President, Jair Bolsonaro, at the G20 summit in Rome in which he confirmed that the Covid-19 vaccines are incapable of preventing infection and transmission of the virus, that the WHO does not support the use of Vaccine Passports as they are discriminatory, and the WHO does not recommend children are giving the experimental jab.  It is unclear whether Tedros meant to state that countries are deliberately killing children with booster shots of the Covid-19 vaccines, or whether it was just a slip of the tongue. But the Director-General of the WHO did not correct himself, and there is plenty of evidence that the Covid-19 injections are causing life threatening events, permanent disabilities, and deaths among children.  An investigation of data found in the USA’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), found that up to November 5th 2021, the Pfizer Covid-19 injection had caused 16,880 adverse events, 5,161 emergency room visits, 1,365 hospitalisations, 264 life threatening events, 120 permanent disabilities, and 29 deaths among children between the ages of 6 and 17.  Here are a few examples of the specific reports of deaths among children occurring due to the Covid-19 vaccine –  A 16-year-old female received the Pfizer vaccine on the 19th March 2021. Nine days later the same female went into cardiac arrest at home. By the 30th March 2021 she had sadly died.  A 15-year-old female suffered cardiac arrest and ended up in intensive care four days after having the Moderna mRNA jab. She also sadly died.  A 15-year-old female received her second dose of the Pfizer jab on the 6th June 2021. Sadly one day later she died suddenly without reason.  A 15-year-old male had the Pfizer mRNA jab. One day later he suffered heart failure and sadly died.  Evidence from data published by the Office for National Statistics on deaths in England and Wales, also shows that since all children over the age of 12 were offered the Covid-19 vaccine deaths among kids have increased significantly against the five-year-average.  The following chart shows the cumulative number of deaths per week, between week 38 and week 45, among all children aged 10-14 in England and Wales in 2021, and the 2015-2019 5-year-average dataset.  Between week 38 and week 45 in the five-year-average dataset, a total of 41 deaths among children aged 10-14 occurred. But during the same time frame this year a total of 59 deaths have occurred among children according to the 2021 dataset. This represents a 44% increase on the five-year-average since they were offered a Covid-19 injection.  There can be no doubt that after two years the official data proves that children do not suffer serious disease due to Covid-19, let alone die with it.  So whether Tedros meant to state that countries are intentionally killing children with Booster shots of the Covid jabs, or it was a slip of the tongue, he is still quite correct that if they are going to administer the injections to anybody at all then it should be the most vulnerable and not children.  “So if it’s going to be used (the Covid-19 vaccine) it’s better to focus on those groups of severe disease and death, rather as we see some countries are using to give boosters to kill children, this is not right.”","BREAKING – Director-General of the WHO claims “Countries are giving Boosters to kill children, this is not right”",false

195,106244005164715375334181175058408459957,"The latest figures published by the new UK Health Security Agency on Covid-19 cases, hospitalisations and deaths show that the vaccinated population still accounted for 4 in every 5 Covid-19 deaths over the past four weeks even though those who are deemed to be the most vulnerable to Covid-19 received their “booster” jab in September and October.  The ‘Covid-19 Vaccine Surveillance Report – Week 50’ was published by the UK Health Security Agency (formerly Public Health England) on Thursday, 16th December 2021, and it shows that the vast majority of Covid-19 cases between November 15th and December 12th were among the fully vaccinated population.  The totals number of cases by vaccination status as confirmed by table 8 of the UKHSA Week 50 Vaccine Surveillance report between November 15th and December 12th 2021 were as follows –  Not-vaccinated population = 417,606  Partly vaccinated population = 79,378 cases  Triple/Double-vaccinated population = 518,373 cases  This means the vaccinated population accounted for 59% of Covid-19 cases between November 15th and December 12th, whilst the not-vaccinated population accounted for 41%. However, if we remove under 18’s from the equation, many of whom aren’t eligible to be vaccinated, the figures are far worse for the vaccinated population.  The totals number of cases by vaccination status in everyone over 18 as confirmed by table 8 of the UKHSA Week 50 Vaccine Surveillance report between November 15th and December 12th 2021, were as follows –  Not-vaccinated population = 104,612 cases  Partly vaccinated population = 32,004 cases  Triple/Double-vaccinated population = 517,061 cases  This means the over 18 vaccinated population accounted for 84% of Covid-19 cases between November 15th and December 12th 2021, whilst the not-vaccinated population accounted for just 16%.  Unfortunately the latest UKHSA report also shows that despite the booster campaign being well underway, the vast majority of Covid-19 hospitalisations were also among the fully vaccinated population between November 15th and December 12th 2021.  The totals number of hospitalisations by vaccination status for all age groups between November 15th and December 12th 2021, as confirmed by table 9 of the UKHSA report were as follows –  Not-vaccinated population = 3,532  Partly vaccinated population = 345  Triple/Double-vaccinated population = 4,256  This means the vaccinated population accounted for 57% of Covid-19 hospitalisations between November 15th and December 12th, whilst the not-vaccinated accounted for just 43%.  But yet again the difference between the vaccinated and unvaccinated gets much worse when it comes to deaths allegedly related to Covid-19.  The totals number of alleged Covid-19 deaths by vaccination status between November 15th and December 12th, as confirmed by table 10 of the UKHSA report were as follows –  Not-vaccinated population = 718 deaths  Partly vaccinated population = 82 deaths  Triple/Double-vaccinated population = 2,259 deaths  This means the vaccinated population accounted for 77% of Covid-19 deaths between November 15th and December 12th, whilst the not-vaccinated accounted for just 23%.  With the vaccinated population accounting for 6 in every 10 Covid-19 cases, 6 in every 10 Covid-19 hospitalisations, and 8 in every 10 Covid-19 deaths, is there really any justification for the talk that has now started in the mainstream media around mandatory vaccinations in the UK, following the lead of Austria, Greece, Germany, and soon enough France?  Is there any justification for the vaccine passports that have been imposed in Scotland and Wales, and now England?  Is there any justification for restrictions being placed on the unvaccinated population, such as forcing them to be tested and isolate at home for 10 days if a close contact of an alleged confirmed infection, whilst the vaccinated can roam free?  The Covid-19 injections do not prevent infection.  The Covid-19 injections do not prevent transmission.  According to the data it does not look like they prevent hospitalisation or death either.  The only thing that the Covid-19 injections currently prevent is the respect of the basic human rights afforded to every person prior to 2020.",Triple & Double Vaccinated accounted for 4 in every 5 Covid-19 Deaths in England over the past month despite most vulnerable getting Booster in October,mixture

198,249033372590462701657603465523093001287,"The military commission empowered to decide the fate of George W. Bush found the former president guilty of treason and murder, and decreed on Thursday that he be hanged by the neck until dead.  The 3-officer panel tasked with weighing the military’s evidence against Bush reached a decision after hearing days of heated testimony.  On Thursday Bush returned to Guantanamo Bay’s south courtroom without the benefit of having his lawyer present, the latter having been ejected from the proceedings on Wednesday for refusing to curb his theatrical, emotional outbursts. Aufhauser had vowed to file an appeal in response to his ejection, but it’s uncertain to whom he would take such action.  Two more witnesses—both appearing on ZOOM–on Thursday morning testified that George W. Bush had warned them to at all costs avoid New York City, and particularly lower Manhattan, on September 11, and with Bush’s message came a warning: Keep it confidential, or else.  Rick Osborne, a longtime friend of the Bush family and former investigator for the Texas Rangers Division, told the panel he and his family had been planning to vacation in New York the week of September 10, but cancelled on September 8 after receiving an ominous telephone call from the defendant.  “He told me his intelligence people got credible intel that a terrorist attack might go down in New York that week, and he urged me to postpone my trip. I pressed him for mor info—it’s what investigators do—but he wasn’t saying much more. Just told me in damn clear terms to keep my mouth shut about his caution as it was a matter of national security,” Osborne told the panel.  “And as a member of law enforcement you didn’t feel it necessary to investigate further, or tell anyone?” Rear Adm. Crandall pressed him.  “Who the heck was I going to tell? He was George W. Bush, the president. In retrospect I wish I had, but I can’t go back in time,” Osborne said.  The next to testify was none other than James Baker, who served as White House Chief of Staff and United States Secretary of the Treasury under President Ronald Reagan, and as U.S. Secretary of State and White House Chief of Staff under President George H. W. Bush. The 91-year-old statesman had a physician at his side and a nasal cannula in his nostrils. He struggled to speak, and between gasping breaths said that he, too, had been told by the defendant to avoid New York and D.C. the week of September 10.  “I had a public speaking engagement scheduled in New York and Washington for that week,” Baker sputtered. “It was either two or three days before 9/11—I can’t remember what day—double-yew phoned me, telling me to stay home that week because something big was about to happen. I wanted more information, but he beat around the bush, no pun intended, and got silent. Told me, though, that both he and his father needed me to keep it a secret. I’ve known them all my life, but I knew better than to cross them. Lots of empty space in West Texas, if you catch my meaning.”  “Why are you coming forward now?” Rear Adm. Crandall asked.  “I don’t have much time left, and if there’s even a slim chance I don’t end up in hell, I’ll take it,” Baker replied.  Rear Adm. Crandall asserted that witness testimony, in combination with the Rumsfeld tapes, proved conclusively that George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, and Donald Rumsfeld were the architects of 9/11.  Although he had more “proof” to offer into evidence, the panel said it had heard enough to not only find Bush guilty but also recommend he hang for crimes against America. The 3-officers found him guilty of treason and held him to account for every life lost on 9/11.  Rear Adm. Crandall affirmed the verdict, and he set George W. Bush’s date of execution for Tuesday, January 4.  (Note: Gavin Newsom’s tribunal was delayed and is now slated to begin December 27)  RRN is an independent publisher that relies on reader support.

The disaster relief agency, however, brought more Covid-19 vaccinations than it did blankets, food, and bottled water, a clear sign that the Deep State-run organization is still trying to coerce law-abiding Americans into taking the jab.  In September Real Raw News reported exclusively on a similar event that took place in Louisiana, in the aftermath of Hurricane Ida. Residents displaced by the storm got a FEMA ultimatum: Take the jab or forget about entering the disaster zone to recover personal belongings. A FEMA whistleblower told RRN that the agency tricked 500 Louisianians into getting the clot shot.  And since FEMA doesn’t let a good disaster go to waste, it’s up to its old tricks again.  As morning sunlight revealed the devastation in tornado-ravaged Mayfield, Kentucky, hundreds of FEMA personnel, some armed, and hospital nurses conscripted into serving the federal government, rolled into a city turned warzone.  They set up “command centers” in the hardest hit areas, near a candle factory where eight people died in the storm, and a block away from a subdivision where 70 homes had been ripped from their foundations.  A middle-aged woman in shredded clothes and her face encrusted in dried blood hobbled from the rubble and found her way to a FEMA relief station, an olive drab tent guarded by a pair of assault rifle-wielding FEMA agents. Her house, her life, she told them, was gone, lost to the tornado. She’d had one arm wrapped around a banister and the other clutched to her dog when the storm peeled away the roof. The swirling, howling winds yanked her canine companion from her grasp, and it spun up into the vortex. Barely able to speak, she asked for water.  Upon entering the tent, she spied a cooler. The nurse in the tent opened the cooler, which did not hold bottles of chilled water but was filled from bottom to top with vials of Covid-19 vaccinations.  “Have you received your Covid-19 vaccinations and booster shot?” the nurse asked, holding a syringe. “There may be an outbreak in this area.”  The woman’s encounter is not an isolated incident.  A FEMA source speaking under promise of anonymity told RRN that the Department of Homeland Security has empowered FEMA to withhold disaster relief until persons declare their vaccination status, supply proof of vaccination, or submit to mandatory shots.  “We’re literally turning away the walking wounded if they won’t get a shot. If you want a place to sleep, a blanket, food, or water, you better tell us, and be able to prove, you’ve been vaccinated, or roll up your sleeve. Otherwise, go sleep in the rubble.

McCullough’s background has included serving on review teams for new vaccines, so he was surprised at what happened in early 2021 when the COVID vaccines were rolled out.  “I chaired data safety monitoring boards … a couple dozen times — I know what I’m talking about,” McCullough said.  “I’ve shut down, with my committees, big pharma programs … I mean, huge pharma programs.”  But things were handled very differently for the COVID vaccines, and McCullough called FDA actions “reprehensible and reckless.”  Under normal circumstances, when officials learned on January 22 of this year that there had already been 182 deaths following 278 million shots, the vaccine program would have been halted, McCulloch said recently on the DarkHorse podcast of scientist Bret Weinstein.  “Our [COVID] vaccine program would have been shut down in February for excess mortality in America,” he said.  McCullough said the shutdown should have been similar to the 1976 suspension of nationwide voluntary vaccination for the swine flu following only three deaths and 94 cases of paralysis due to those shots.  He said there are major risks with the COVID shots, especially for old people.  “We now know it’s the seniors who die with the vaccine … 50 percent of these deaths occur within 48 hours, 80 percent within a week,” he said.  “There’s nursing home studies from Europe and Scandinavia. They show — when they actually review the charts there in the seniors — at least 40 percent, the doctors have concluded, are directly due to the vaccines.”  McCullough said patients suffered “severe reactions, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, blood pressure dropping and then death within a day or two, whether it’s basically a cardiopulmonary collapse due to overwhelming production of the spike protein or a thromboembolic or bleeding death a few weeks later.  “But they are clearly biologically related to the vaccines,” he said.  There’s also risk to young people, according to McCullough, noting that some obituaries for young adults are listing vaccination as the cause of death.  Then there are the side effects. Even the Food and Drug Administration agrees there is a link between myocarditis and the shots. “It was in younger children — it was serious! Ninety percent required hospitalization,” McCullough said.  Are the vaccines a greater risk for teens than COVID?

The myocarditis cases affect boys more than girls and “the real rate of myocarditis is at least 50 percent greater than what the [Centers for Disease Control] ever projected,” McCullough said, adding that children age 12 to 17 are more likely to be hospitalized for myocarditis than for COVID.  When Weinstein noted the vaccine mandates, the bullying, the stigmatizing of the unvaccinated, the demise of civil liberties and general ignorance of myocarditis, McCullough responded that, in general, people are willing to do what it takes to stop COVID.  “But people aren’t willing to sacrifice their life for this.  “And that’s what they’re being asked for; they’re being asked to … take a vaccine, and even though it’s rare, you could lose your life and then people are saying, ‘Well, how rare is rare?’ and I can just tell you, the mortality rate by all expert analyses is unacceptably high.  “We’re at 18,000 people in the CDC U.S. VAERS; about half of those are domestic — Americans — that have died with the vaccine.  “There is very good work done with the CMS [Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services] data suggesting the underreporting factor on this is about five, so if you take 9,000 times 5, we currently are at some number that is, you know, 45,000 – 50,000 [American deaths]. And that’s conservative. It could be greater than that.”  People are becoming aware of what’s going on, according to McCullough. “People are walking away from their jobs because they know they could die with the vaccine.  “Once the word got out that people could die after the vaccine — in fact, deaths were occurring in large numbers — that was by mid-April … Rates of vaccination plummeted in mid-April. They absolutely plummeted.  “The word got out. It doesn’t matter what was on Twitter or on major media, people were talking to one another — everyone knew.  Yet, despite ongoing media and political alarmism, the COVID crisis is over, McCulloch said.  That’s because 80 percent of children in the U.S. already have had COVID. And they and everyone else who has had COVID are protected by natural immunity.  “And now the CDC in the last week has acknowledged that they don’t have a single case of someone who has recovered from COVID getting it a second time and passing to anyone.  “So it’s basically over with.”  McCullough cited a preprint study posted in September at clinicalnews.org, that, while not yet peer-reviewed, supported his observations regarding vaccinated teens. It noted “a 4-fold increased risk of postvaccination myocarditis in those who had previously been infected” with COVID.  The report said it had been assumed that risks of COVID would outweigh risks of vaccination in 16- to 17-year-old boys, but the study found just the opposite. The report “predicted excess cases of vaccine-associated myocarditis/pericarditis would exceed COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths under the ‘worst case scenario.'”  Also, risks of myocarditis weighed heavily on males, with boys aged 12-15 having myocarditis rates of 162.2 per million compared to 13 cases per million for girls aged 12-15. Boys aged 16-17 had 94 cases per million compared to 13.4 cases per million for girls of that age, the clinicalnews.org study said.

201,230821740422546858440102056159986733057,"Wednesday, December 8  The officers empaneled to judge the military’s case against George W. Bush sat in silence as the defendant, shackled at the wrists and flanked on either side by a uniformed MP, entered GITMOs south courtroom and took a seat beside his attorney, David D. Aufhauser, at the defense table. Next to them was a throng of junior lawyers and paralegals dressed in dark suits and somber ties, a conclave of legal minds hired seemingly to intimidate the military’s resolute prosecutor, Rear Adm. Darse E. Crandall.  Before launching into an opening statement lasting nearly 3 hours, Rear Adm. Crandall assured everyone in attendance that JAG and the OMC had comprehensively vetted the panel for impartiality, a fair trial. He quipped, however, that of the 250 officers JAG had interviewed, only 3 showed no bias or animus toward the former president.  “We had to do extensive interviews because it was nearly impossible to find officers whose lives hadn’t been impacted in some way by the defendant’s crimes,” Rear Adm. Crandall said, provoking an objection.  Aufhauser argued that Rear Adm. Crandall’s comment was inflammatory enough to taint the panel, and demanded a mistrial.  “My remark was not of malice, but of fact, Mr. Aufhauser. This case will be prosecuted without passion or prejudice, and there will be no mistrial,” Rear Adm. Crandall replied.  He said JAG’s evidence would demonstratively prove that George W. Bush, while serving as the 43rd President of the United States, knowingly committed multiple acts of treason on the nation and its people, and that those transgressions, which included war crimes and conspiring with hostile foreign governments, contributed to the deaths of 8,793 soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan.  “Evidence will show Bush profited massively from his illegal wars,” Rear Adm. Crandall said, “and that is partly why we are seeking 1 count of murder for every life lost during those wars. Consolidating the fatalities to a lesser number of charges would marginalize the lives lost, the families destroyed.”  While he was speaking, George W. Bush sat silently beside his lawyer with an aloof grin on his wrinkled face. Every now and then he nodded or wagged his head, but, apparently at his lawyer’s advice, otherwise sat motionless and tranquil.  Not so tranquil was Aufhauser, his boisterous voice echoing throughout the chamber, as Rear Adm. Crandall said he would prove beyond all doubt that Bush had lied about the number of people who perished in the North and South Towers of the World Trade Center. JAG, he told the panel, had evidence that directly countered official narrative.  “We’ve been led to believe 2,997 died when the towers fell. This was a lie to soften the blow, so to speak. The genuine number is between 6,950-7,000, and when we begin discussing evidence and presenting witnesses on Friday, you’ll see how we arrived at that number. You’ll hear an audio recording of Bush, in his own voice and words, discussing with his senior staff reasons for obscuring the truth,” Rear Adm. Crandall said.  “What is this?” Aufhauser said. “Even the 9/11 Commission Report exonerated my client of any responsibility for 9/11. Tragic loss of life, yes, but not my client’s fault.”  “Your client commissioned the report. It points fingers at everyone but him and Cheney. Our evidence will prove the report is filled with inaccuracies and fallacies to shift blame away from the defendant,” Rear Adm. Crandall said. “Prosecution will also prove that no plane struck the Pentagon, and that United Airlines Flight 93 was, on Bush and Cheney’s orders, shot down. The buck doesn’t stop there.”  The tangible losses beyond death were obvious and massive, he said, and put the tribunal in recess until Friday morning.

202,196098035710377202392543265749638365880,"Friday, December 10  George W. Bush had been president less than a year when thoughts of wealth, power, and influence consumed his malleable mind and set him on a one-way path to evil. Influenced by a vice president whose moral turpitude eclipsed his own, Bush converted the Oval Office into a den of depravity, a sinister sanctum where he and his cancerous cabal plotted to kill three birds with one stone, as a modified version of the saying goes. Find a way to legitimize seizing foreign oil while also capturing, and profiting from, the expansive opium fields covering the vast landscape of Afghanistan. He also, of course, wanted to finish what his father had started in Iraq—deposing or assassinating Saddam Hussein. Moreover, Bush felt Americans had too many freedoms, and he desperately sought to curtail the rights and freedoms Americans hold dear.  That was Rear Adm. Darse E. Crandall’s opening message, as George W. Bush’s tribunal resumed Friday morning at Guantanamo Bay.  Surprisingly, Bush’s attorney David Aufhauser said he would forego an opening statement, instead opting to deliver remarks after JAG rested its case.  The first item Rear Adm. Crandall offered into evidence was a microcassette with three distinct voices: George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, and Donald Rumsfeld’s. Three independent experts, he told the panel, had digitally compared voices on the tape against over 150 publicly available recordings of the three men, and determined with reasonable certainty (97.5%) that the voices indeed belonged to Bush, Cheney, and Rumsfeld.  “We don’t know the exact date this conversation took place, but we can infer through the conversation it was approximately three months before 9/11,” Rear Adm. Crandall said, and pressed the play button.  Bush: “If we’re doing this, we have to go all in, you know. And after it’s done, we’ll need a damn good excuse to sell Congress, and our hands, they’ll have to be squeaky clean.”  Cheney: “They’ll be no ties to us. And our hands—well, they’ll be bathed in bleach.”  Bush: “How much is this gonna cost?”  Cheney: “Who cares? It’s not our money (Cheney laughs) and we get richer at taxpayer expense. I can set everything up, but I need your ok on it.”  Rumsfeld: “If we want this for September, we don’t have a lot of preparation time, maybe 3 months.”  Cheney: “Don, the government works efficiently when we need it to. We do this, and a lot of information we don’t want made public goes away forever. We blame Bin Laden—I don’t think we need him anymore—and after the dust settles in New York and Washington, we bomb the shit out of Kabul. No one cares if we destroy some ancient stone buildings and thatch huts. And you get to show off shiny new weapons.”  Bush: “And the world will buy it? They’ll believe some poorly funded Jihadists managed to pull off the most sophisticated and deadly terror attack in history, and on American soil? I’m all for killing the fuckers, Dick, but they’ll believe this?”  Cheney: “You’re the fucking president, George, they’ll believe whatever you tell them to believe.”  Rear Adm. Crandall paused the tape. “This obviously is not the first conversation they had on planning 9/11, but this alone speaks volumes and—”  Aufhauser stood, raising an objection. “This seems highly improper. You suddenly have a magic tape, a smoking gun, and expect us to accept its legitimacy. Until now, Defense had no knowledge of the tape. Wouldn’t it have been proper to provide us a copy, so we, too, could’ve had it tested for authenticity. Could you tell us, please, where you obtained this tape?”  “I can: Rumsfeld made it. All I can say is it was discovered among his personal possessions after he suicided himself at his tribunal,” Rear Adm. Crandall said.  “Why would he have made a recording that could eventually incriminate him?” Aufhauser asked.  “How should I know, and that’s not our concern. Maybe he wanted an insurance policy in case the plan went south and George and Dick tried to pin the blame on him, but I don’t engage in speculation, only fact. And fact is, that is Gorge, Dick, and Don on that tape,” Rear Adm. Crandall said sardonically.  Aufhauser asked why, if the tape was authentic, Cheney wasn’t sitting beside Bush as a co-defendant.  “Because he fled the country the same night George was arrested. An interesting coincidence, don’t you think?” Rear Adm. Crandall asked, and played the tape.  Bush: “What kind of casualties are we looking at on the Homefront?”  Cheney: “So, a few thousand, maybe more.”  Bush: “Oh, that’s not so bad.”  Rumsfeld: “Every battle has collateral damage. We must accept ours.”  Bush: “As long as we’re not getting fucking blamed for it.”  Cheney: “Like I said, that won’t happen.”  While the tape played, Bush seemed unphased, simply staring glassily at the wall as his attorney contested the tape’s veracity.  “Before we hear more, Admiral Crandall, could we please recess until Monday, so Defense, with your consent, can have this tape authenticated over the weekend. I also respectfully ask for copies of any additional evidence you plan to use that we haven’t been made aware of,” Aufhauser said.  “As you’ve been reminded in the past, this is not a civilian trial. We don’t have to oblige that request. But I will give you a copy of the tape and the weekend,” Rear Adm. Crandall said.  He put the tribunal in recess until Monday morning.

203,173184581265855895874258689419970282073,"U.S. Marines on Saturday served a military arrest warrant on Deep State agent Mike Donilon, an American attorney and campaign consultant who served as a Senior Advisor to fake President Joe Biden. He was the chief strategist of Joe Biden’s 2020 criminal presidential campaign.  Before sunrise Saturday morning, Marines operating under the authority of MARSOC, JAG, and the OMC surrounded Donilon’s vacation home in Narragansett, Rhode Island, a seaside community of 15,000 souls, many of them tied to the Deep State hegemony.  The Marines found him asleep, in bed, with two half-empty bottles of liquor and a 9mm Beretta on a nightstand in arm’s reach. Hungover and barely able to speak, Donilon was taken into military custody without incident and transported to a processing center from where he will ultimately be sent to Guantanamo Bay.  Donilon is the second—that RRN knows of—Biden handler arrested in the last two weeks. On November 20 U.S. Marine Raiders from Camp Lejeune captured Anita Dunn, who, like Donilon, had been a driving force in the illigitimate administration’s plan to permanently lockdown and bankrupt American society.  A JAG source speaking under promise of anonymity told Real Raw News that the military had Donilon under surveillance for several weeks, but waited until he was alone and isolated before launching into action. A major problem with capturing Deep State assets, our source pointed out, is that they tend to congregate in large groups and surround themselves with the innocent.  “Donilon’s arrest took place days before he was going to meet with Biden’s economic team. We had tips that they planned to discuss how to once again lockdown the country over this Omicron thing. And evidence obtained at his home vindicated those tips,” our source said.  Among other incriminating evidence, Marines found in Donilon’s possession a handwritten proposal that detailed plans to spike inflation by another 6% over the next 6 months, a move that would certainly bankrupt persons and businesses already hit hard by the scamdemic.  “Discuss with [Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors Chairperson] Celia Rouse—the lower and middle class will realize we’re not really opening the SPR (presumably meaning strategic petroleum reserves) when fuel prices do not drop and continue to increase in cost. Within 3-6 months suspicions will arise, and we may need other angles…” part of his notes read.  Moreover, the documents referenced the myriad cargo ships sitting off the coast of California.  “We must do everything in our authority to prevent imported goods from reaching consumers. In this, we can use Omicron to our advantage,” it read.  Worse, his notes encouraged the COE to manufacture ways to levy additional taxes on domestic corn and wheat products, the nation’s biggest agricultural commodities.  “We expect to learn a lot more through information on his electronic devices. Donilon is a traitor to America and will finally have to answer for his crimes,” our source said.  (Visited 12 times, 12 visits today)",Military Arrests Biden Handler Mike Donilon,false
204,223070855195192789943992369960732560189,"An NIH whistleblower privy to a telephone Thursday morning telephone call between the corrupt administration and members of the Biden-⁠Harris Administration COVID-⁠19 Health Equity Task Force told Real Raw News that an enraged Kamala Harris called unvaccinated Americans “very dirty Trump people” after CDC Director Rochelle Walensky admitted to the difficulty of vaccinating every American citizen.  Also on the call were NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins—a vaccine pusher who Fox News’ Bret Bair has called “an American hero”—administration Communication Director Kim Bedingfield, Secretary of Health & Human Services Director Xavier Becerra, and Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas, a self-admitted Communist.  The 25-minute call began with Harris bemoaning “Trump supporters refusing to get vaccinated” and blaming the alleged spread the of Delta and now Omicron Covid-19 variants on Donald J. Trump and his “gang of dirty people.”  Harris launched a sprawling, breathless rant, assailing Trump with every vile name under the sun, and audaciously saying that Hillary Clinton, had she “assumed her rightful place in the White House in 2016,” would have stopped Covid-19 in its tracks before it reached American soil.  “Donald Trump soiled this country, and it’s our responsibility to correct the path. Covid is Trump’s fault; we must press that hard. We must keep him from going into the 2024 primaries. We have other people working other attack angles, but we cannot let Biden or me take blame for even a single fatality. It all started under Trump, so it’s his fault, and it’s his filthy people who, like rats, are spreading this pestilence. That’s the narrative we’re aiming for. We have Dr. Fauci on our side, and most Americans will believe whatever he says,” Harris purportedly said.  Her spurious tirade, our source said, induced a standing ovation, with Collins, Walensky, and Mayorkas pledging to commit their resources to “obliterate” Trump’s chances of returning to the Oval Office. She spent more time blasting Trump than she did discussing ways of mitigating the alleged Omicron variant, which is purely fictional, doctors have told RRN.  No person on the call, our source said, admitted to the Omicron fraud, as they chose their words meticulously. But they indirectly confessed their maleficence by linking the imaginary sickness to supporters of Donald Trump.  “It doesn’t matter if people get sick or not—everyone needs quarterly booster shots. They benefit everyone. If people support Donald Trump, we’re not getting all the shots in the arms that we have to get,” CDC Director Walensky said on the call.  “The unvaccinated are a threat to homeland security,” Mayorkas said. “DHS will keep helping the CDC monitoring the unvaccinated.”  “Trump’s supporters are the problem; they’re dirty,” Kim Bedingfield agreed.  “I wish they’d all just go away,” Harris replied. “They’re all unvaccinated January 6thers waiting to happen.”  In closing, Harris’ plummeting popularity, even among Deep Staters, seems to have earned the Border Czar and chief official of the Covid-19 task force a new responsibility: reigniting liberal hatred of Donald Trump by inventing things for which he was never responsible.

206,165902892072150497442532050464583835900,"Dr. Anthony Fauci sat down with “Meta” CEO Mark Zuckerberg and finally said out loud what many people have been warning for over a year about the rushed mRNA vaccines: They may actually make the Covid pandemic worse.        Dr. Fauci was commenting on a recent study that showed that the Covid vaccines may actually make a recipient more likely to be reinfected than someone with natural immunity from a prior infection.  “This would not be the first time, if it happened, that a vaccine that looked good in initial safety actually made people worse,” Fauci said. “There was the history of the Respiratory Syncitial Virus vaccine in children, which paradoxically made the children worse.”  Pause and read that again. Now consider all of the announcements made by “public health experts” that promised the “vaccines” were “100% safe and effective,” even for children who are at nearly zero risk.

Name This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.  Dr. Fauci wasn’t done yet, though. He went on to state another example that he was directly involved with where a treatment made individuals worse.  “One of the HIV vaccines that we tested several years ago actually made individuals more likely to get infected,” Fauci added.  The RSV vaccine’s failure was exposed in 2008 by researchers who finally untangled the decades-old mystery.  “In the late 1960s, children in Washington, DC received an RSV vaccine in which the virus was inactivated with formalin,” Reuters reported. “Eighty percent of the children given the shot were hospitalized with severe respiratory disease, and two died. Many scientists had thought the formalin was responsible for the vaccine’s problems, but the chemical has been used safely in other vaccines.”  “The problem, they report this month in the journal Nature Medicine, was that the children’s antibodies were not binding strongly enough to the inactivated virus to produce a protective immune response,” the report noted. “Instead, the antibodies were dragging the dead virus with them, triggering a massive attack by other arms of the immune system.”  It should be noted that in 2019, the NIH admitted that “we are still lacking a safe and effective RSV vaccine.” But it somehow developed a “safe and effective” Covid-19 vaccine in a matter of months?  As noted before, the American public has no way of knowing if the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was rigorously tested, because the FDA refuses to fully release the documents for 75 years. A “whistleblower” on the inside of Pfizer’s clinical trials has documented many alleged serious issues, including “falsifying data.”  The phenomenon that Dr. Fauci is alluding to, “leaky vaccines,” has been well-documented. A Penn State University study showed that “leaky” vaccines can cause viruses to become lethal for the unvaccinated.  “Not all vaccines prevent infection,” PSU noted. “Some, known as leaky vaccines, prolong host survival or reduce disease symptoms without preventing viral replication and transmission. Although leaky vaccines provide anti-disease benefits to vaccinated individuals, new research by CIDD’s Andrew Read, David Kennedy and colleagues at the Avian Oncogenic Virus Group in the United Kingdom, and The University of New England in Australia, has demonstrated that leaky vaccines can make the situation for unvaccinated individuals worse.”  “Leaky vaccines work by enhancing host immunity to a particular pathogen, without necessarily blocking or slowing viral replication,” the article continues. “The result is that infected but vaccinated individuals have extended survival, allowing highly virulent pathogen that would normally reach an evolutionary dead-end in a dead host, can transmit. The evolutionary consequences of high virulence are thus reduced and these pathogens can be selectively favored as a result of leaky vaccination. ”  A 2019 article in Healthline discussed the attempt to prevent Marek’s disease from spreading among chickens.  “After experiments done in a specialized pathogen-containment facility at The Pirbright Institute in the United Kingdom, the researchers concluded that the vaccines developed to combat Marek’s disease were imperfect or leaky,” the story notes.  “These vaccines also allow the virulent virus to continue evolving precisely because they allow the vaccinated individuals, and therefore themselves, to survive,” said Venugopal Nair, who led the research team.  “These less-than-perfect vaccines create a ‘leaky’ barrier against the virus,” the story continues. “Vaccinated individuals may get sick but have less severe symptoms, but the virus survives long enough to transmit to others, which allows it to survive and spread throughout a population.”  “Our research demonstrates that the use of leaky vaccines can promote the evolution of nastier ‘hot’ viral strains that put unvaccinated individuals at greater risk,” Nair said.  A new Harvard study recently showed that the mRNA “vaccines” endorsed by the FDA and CDC are worse than useless at stopping the spread of Covid-19.  The study of 68 nations and 2,947 counties in the United States published in the European Journal of Epidemiology showed that “At the country-level, there appears to be no discernable relationship between percentage of population fully vaccinated and new COVID-19 cases in the last 7 days. In fact, the trend line suggests a marginally positive association such that countries with higher percentage of population fully vaccinated have higher COVID-19 cases per 1 million people.”  That is exactly what Becker News had pointed out in September:  As the Covid pandemic continues to defy predictions about when it will finally be ‘over,’ there is a curious phenomenon taking place across the United States and around the globe: Covid-19 case rates increasing alongside vaccination rates. The textbook examples of this disturbing trend are the nations of Israel, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Israel is now experiencing its fourth wave, which is being accompanied by another round of ‘booster shots.’ Israel has 61.5% of all adults “fully vaccinated” (although the use of ‘booster shots’ throws the term into question.)  Meanwhile, a new independent study corroborates the famous Israeli study from August that shows natural immunity is superior to “vaccinated immunity.”  The latest study states that: “Confirmed infection rates increased according to time elapsed since the last immunity-conferring event in all cohorts. For unvaccinated previously infected individuals they increased from 10.5 per 100,000 risk-days for those previously infected 4-6 months ago to 30.2 for those previously infected over a year ago. For individuals receiving a single dose following prior infection they increased from 3.7 per 100,000 person days among those vaccinated in the past two months to 11.6 for those vaccinated over 6 months ago. For vaccinated previously uninfected individuals the rate per 100,000 person days increased from 21.1 for persons vaccinated within the first two months to 88.9 for those vaccinated more than 6 months ago.”  Thus, the vaccinated previously uninfected individuals are two-to-three times more likely to be reinfected after six months than unvaccinated previously infected individuals. One of the more useful aspects of this study is that it unpacks the overlap between vaccinated immunity and natural immunity; some research suggests the overlap between the two categories may be as high as 60-70%. Therefore, claims about “vaccinated immunity” may be benefiting from the fact that over half of the United States is estimated to have natural immunity.  The latest remarks from Dr. Fauci suggest that the NIAID chief is not surprised by the abysmal failure of the “vaccines” to stop the spread.

208,320121330391538880747631953933636049560,"The Center For Disease Control and the federal government officials are adamant that pregnant women get a COVID-19 injection.  But data doesn’t support its safety and health practitioners around the world are sounding the alarm.  A Canadian doctor, who has effectively treated COVID patients with Ivermectin throughout, urges pregnant women to abstain from getting the COVID injections.  Speaking to a reporter in November, Dr. Daniel Nagase argues COVID vaccines are directly attributed to an alarming increase in stillbirths across Canada.  Doulas who work in women and children’s hospitals in one of the birthing centers for Vancouver “had 13 stillbirths in a 24-hour period,” Nagase contends.  “In Waterloo, Ontario, I have a more reliable statistic,” he said. “There were 86 stillbirths between January and July. Normally, it’s only five or six stillbirths every year. So, about one stillbirth every two months is the usual rate. To suddenly get to 86 stillbirths in six months, that’s highly unusual. But the most important confirmation that we have from the Waterloo, Ontario report was that all of the 86 stillbirths were fully vaccinated.  “We are seeing a correlation and certainly when you see a correlation, you have to start asking, ‘In the water in Waterloo, is there something? Is there something in the air? Is there some toxin in the food supply? But when you see the same correlation in different parts of the country – in Vancouver and then in Waterloo, and you see an increase in stillbirths. You have to ask yourself what is going on that is both in Waterloo, Ontario and Vancouver that is suddenly causing an increase in stillbirths?”  Taxpayer-funded hospitals must be held accountable, Nagase argued.  “We need to get Freedom of Information Requests. We need doctors, nurses, unit clerks at hospitals to start printing out the statistics because we know if we ask the health authorities to print out the statistics they will refuse and that is absolutely criminal because who pays for the hospitals? We do. It is our information– we own that information,” he said. “We should not be asking some administrator for permission to get the death statistics. We should not have to ask some kind of health minister for permission to get the actual rate of [intensive care unit] stays. They’re saying it’s ‘unvaccinated people,’ but there are so many people who are within 2 weeks of their second shot and they getting deathly ill. This information is our information.  “We deserve to know how many percent of the ICU is filled with people who are having side effects within one week of the injection. And then, if they are clogging the ICUs because they are getting a vaccine injury, but then they’re being labeled as unvaccinated, that is an absolute lie.”  On Nov. 30, Dr. Nagase and Dr. Mel Bruchet launched an investigation into Lions Gate Hospital in North Vancouver to verify why claims alleged by doulas about the influx of stillbirths among COVID-vaccinated mothers.  “Nagase launched an official complaint with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police against executives at the College of Physicians & Surgeons of BC, alleging conflicts of interest influencing their policies, decisions and statements made to the people of British Columbia,” Fox 26 reports.  The CDC maintains there is no increased risk of miscarriages among those who’ve been vaccinated, however, the former Pfizer vice president Dr. Michael Yeadon has corroborated the claims made by Nagase and a multitude of health practitioners underfire for warning against COVID injections.  “We never, ever give experimental medicines to pregnant women,” said Yeadon warned in August during a “Stop the Shot” conference hosted by Life Site News. “You never, ever give inadequately tested medicines, medicinal products, to a pregnant woman. And that is exactly what is happening. Our government is urging pregnant women, and women of childbearing age, to get vaccinated. And they’re telling them they’re safe. And that’s a lie because those studies have simply not been done.”    Yeadon, who holds degrees in biochemistry, toxicology, and a Ph.D. in respiratory pharmacology and launched his own biotech company after working in the pharmaceutical industry for 32 years. The former Pfizer executive called attention to a Japanese study that found high concentrations of the spike protein in the ovaries when tested on mRNA vaccine injected rats.  “What we find is the vaccine [in rats] doesn’t just distribute around the body and then wash out again, which is what you’d hope,” he said. “It concentrates in ovaries of rats, and it concentrates at least 20-fold over the concentration in other background tissues like muscles.  “You don’t want this product in your ovaries. It’s simply not necessary to induce immunity to have a vaccine in your ovaries. And, as it’s concentrating in the ovaries, getting higher concentrations over time, they have not even defined what the maximum levels are or when that occurs.”","(VIDEO) Doctor Warns Stillbirths Are Rampant Among Fully Vaccinated Mothers, Launches Investigation",false

(Source.)  The vast majority of these have been from the Pfizer shot (1,862 deaths) and the Moderna shot (656 deaths.)  There have been more fetal deaths in the past 11 months following COVID-19 shots than there have been for the past 30+ years following ALL vaccines (2,198 – Source.)  Last month (October, 2021) the New England Journal of Medicine admitted that the original study used to justify the CDC and the FDA in recommending the shots to pregnant women was flawed. (Source.)  Since then, researchers in New Zealand have conducted a new study on the original data, and concluded:  A re-analysis of these figures indicates a cumulative incidence of spontaneous abortion ranging from 82% (104/127) to 91% (104/114), 7–8 times higher than the original authors’ results. (Source.)  And yet, the CDC and FDA still continue to recommend the shots for pregnant women, even though a correct analysis on the original data shows that 82% to 91% of pregnant women will suffer miscarriages if their unborn child is less than 20 weeks old. (Source.)  VAERS is a passive system that is severely under reported. The CDC and FDA have never conducted a study to determine what this under-reported factor is, but independent scientists have, and we have previously published the analysis conducted by Dr. Jessica Rose, who has determined that a conservative under-reported factor would be X41. See:  This means that there have probably been at least 99,753 fetal deaths following COVID-19 injections so far.  Here is a video report we made on this last month with some very unfortunate gruesome examples of what these shots are doing to unborn babies.  Related:  UPDATE – November 7, 2021 PM  A couple of hours after publishing this article, a video that has been circulating on the Internet of an interview with a Funeral Director in the UK became known to me.  He has been in practice for over 3 years and is identified as “Wesley,” and was interviewed by a group called “Resistance GB.”  He claims that last fall was one the slowest periods of seeing deaths for all funeral directors, but when the COVID-19 shots were introduced, deaths started dramatically increasing.  It started with the elderly, but then by April they were seeing large numbers of people in their 30s and 40s. Many of them were dying of myocarditis.  Now, they are seeing unprecedented numbers of newborn babies, and they are piling up in hospital refrigerators. Some are full term, some are pre-term, he claims.  The UK originally recommended that pregnant women and nursing mothers should NOT get the experimental COVID shots, but like the CDC in the U.S., they eventually changed their recommendation to encourage pregnant women to get the shots.

210,228426374083869574289835770924944868963,"Authorities are slowly tightening the noose again around the necks of the British public in response to an alleged new Covid-19 variant dubbed Omicron that is feared may evade the current available Covid-19 vaccines. The problem with this is official data shows the alleged Delta variant has been evading the Covid-19 vaccines for at least the 3 past months, because since August 2021 the fully vaccinated have accounted for 9 in every 10, Covid-19 deaths.  Public Health Scotland (PHS) publish a weekly report on Covid-19 statistics which includes data on cases, hospitalisations and deaths by vaccination status.  The report includes data over a period of four weeks and the latest statistics were published by PHS on December 1st 2021, including data on cases and hospitalisations from 30th October to 26th November 2021, and data on deaths from 23rd October to 19th November 2021.  By analysing the data contained within the report alongside data from previous reports that stretches as far back as August 14th 2021, we can see that Scotland has very much been experiencing a ‘Pandemic of the Fully Vaccinated’ since at least August.  Proving the introduction of new restrictions has nothing to do with the worry that the new Omicron variant may impact the effectivenes of the Covid-19 vaccines, and instead has everything to do with control, because the jabs have proven to be ineffective for months.  Covid-19 Cases  Table 19 of the latest ‘Covid-19 Statistical Report’ shows the number of Covid-19 cases per week by vaccination status. We’ve created the following chart on the published data from several reports, including the most recent published December 1st.  As you can see from the above the unvaccinated population accounted for the majority of cases every week between August 21st and September 17th, but since then the fully vaccinated have accounted for the majority of cases every week. However, by including the number of cases among the partly vaccinated population we find that the vaccinated population have in fact accounted for the majority of Covid-19 cases since at least August 21st.  The above chart shows the cumulative number of cases per week by vaccination status between August 21st and November 26th. Here we can see that something significant happened in the week beginning 16th October in regard to the number of cases accumulating among the unvaccinated and fully vaccinated populations, in that the number of cases were beginning to fall among the unvaccinated whilst increasing significantly among the fully vaccinated.  Official data shows that between August 21st and November 26th there were 142,945 cases among the unvaccinated population, 30,204 cases among the partly vaccinated population, and 165,008 cases among the fully vaccinated, bringing the total number of cases among the vaccinated population in this time frame to 195,212.  Covid-19 Hospitalisations  Table 20 of the latest ‘Covid-19 Statistical Report’ shows the number of Covid-19 hospitalisations per week by vaccination status. We’ve created the following chart on the published data from several reports, including the most recent published December 1st.  As you can see from the above the data proves that it is the fully vaccinated population who have been putting a strain on the healthcare system and not the unvaccinated as the authorities and mainstream media would have you believe.  The above chart shows the cumulative number of hospitalisations per week by vaccination status between August 21st and November 26th, in which there were 2,531 hospitalisations among the unvaccinated population but more twice the among among the vaccinated population, who recorded 6,094 hospitalisations.  Covid-19 Deaths  Table 21 of the latest ‘Covid-19 Statistical Report’ shows the number of Covid-19 deaths per week by vaccination status. We’ve created the following chart on the published data from several reports, including the most recent published December 1st.  The data shows that the fully vaccinated have accounted for the vast majority of Covid-19 deaths by a long way since at least August 14th. In the past four weeks along there were just 59 deaths among the unvaccinated population whilst 407 deaths occurred among the vaccinated population.  This means the vaccinated population accounted for 9 in every 10 Covid-19 deaths between October 23rd and November 19th.  The above chart shows the cumulative number of deaths per week by vaccination status between August 14th and November 19th, in which there were just 219 deaths among the unvaccinated population, but 1,280 deaths among the vaccinated population.  This data suggests that the fully vaccinated are 144% more likely to die once hospitalisated with Covid-19 based on the hospitalisation/fatality rates that can be calculated from the statistics.  With 2,531 hospitalisations and 219 deaths among the unvaccinated population this equates to a hospitalisation/fatality rate of 8.6%.  But with 6,094 hospitalisations and 1,280 deaths among the vaccinated population this equates to a hospitalisation/fataity rate of 21%.  Pandemic of the Fully Vaccinated  The data available from Public Health Scotland stretching back 14 weeks proves very much that this is a pandemic of the fully vaccinated, and with the vaccinated accounting for 6 in every 10 cases (57%), 7 in every 10 hospitalisations (70%), and 9 in every 10 Covid-19 deaths (85%) since at least August, this also proves that the Covid-19 vaccines have already been ineffective for months.  Therefore any restrictions enforced in the name of protecting the public from the alleged new Omicron variant have absolutely nothing to do with protecting your health, and instead everything to do with control.",Fully Vaccinated account for 9 in every 10 Covid-19 Deaths since August according to latest Official Data,false

This is now fact, not speculation.  More people have died from the COVID-19 vaccine than from all other vaccines over the last 20 years… COMBINED.  That’s right: the vaccine that is supposed to “protect” you from COVID is now responsible for killing more people than all the other vaccines put together.  Does that make you feel safe yet?  This isn’t our calculation.  This number has been confirmed by the CDC itself.  More details on this alarming new figure below:  ""There have been nearly as many deaths from complications following inoculation with the so-called Covid-19 “vaccines” as there have been for all previous vaccines total since Jan. 1, 2001.""https://t.co/gIrHPDMiwq — Proud Neanderthal.

We’ve also been told to trust the science and to trust the experts.  Well… now the scientific experts at the CDC are telling us the vaccine is deadlier than all the other vaccines!  WND has a breakdown of the CDC’s revealing statement on their website:  There have been nearly as many deaths from complications following inoculation with the so-called Covid-19 “vaccines” as there have been for all previous vaccines total since Jan. 1, 2001. In fact, the data are five days old so the gap, which was at four on May 3, has almost certainly been bridged. According to the CDC website: “Over 245 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines were administered in the United States from Dec. 14, 2020, through May 3, 2021. During this time, VAERS received 4,178 reports of death (0.0017%) among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine. CDC and FDA physicians review each case report of death as soon as notified and CDC requests medical records to further assess reports.” The website went on to boldly proclaim that a “review of available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records has not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines.” This is important medical editorializing so as not to scare people. The CDC has a vested interest in getting as many people vaccinated as possible, so even when burying the important data about deaths at the bottom of a page intended to assuage concerns over these experimental drugs, they did so with every intention of making people take it.  Of course, the concern over the vaccine is nothing new.  Fox News’ Tucker Carlson has been raising legitimate questions.  However, after a segment last week questioning the vaccine, Carlson’s segment was BANNED from YouTube.  Fortunately, people have been ripping the segment and sharing it online.  Watch it below before Big Tech takes it down again:  On this occasion, full marks to Fox News, but it is obviously an exception.

As they should.  But similar to the 2020 presidential election, rather than answering these questions with transparency and integrity, people are refusing to talk about the numbers.  Fortunately for us, the numbers speak for themselves.  Conservative commentator David J. Harris, Jr. had this to say:  On Wednesday night’s episode of Fox News’ “Tucker Carlson Tonight” host Tucker Carlson asked a very important question: “How many Americans have died after taking the COVID vaccines? Not Americans who’ve been killed by the virus, that’s a huge number, but how many Americans have died after getting the vaccines designed to prevent the virus? Do you know the answer to that question? Do you know anything about the downside? We know a lot about the upside of the vaccine. We’ve been completely in favor of vulnerable people taking vaccines.” With our federal government teetering on the edge of going full authoritarian concerning getting the COVID vaccine, do you know all the risks involved? President Joe Biden was on television Tuesday talking about vaccines, about how he wants us all to get one. In fact, everyone with authority wants you to get the COVID vaccine and they are starting to apply enormous pressure for people like me who have been holding out to get the shot. The Biden administration has said that they won’t force COVID vaccine passports or anything like that but when he said that Dr. Fauci also indicated, or was it a dog whistle, to institutions and corporations that they would start using some form of a COVID vaccine passport to let you into the building or use their services. You may not be able to fly on an airplane or go to work or even educate your children if you don’t get the vaccine. Friends and family members may tell you that you’re not welcome at their homes or events if you have not yet been vaccinated. Okay, so a lot of you are contemplating on getting the vaccine because you don’t want to have to deal with the immense pressure being applied on you, but before you get that shot, do you know anything at all about the possible risks of getting the shot? You probably don’t know what I’m about to tell you, and you should know because it’s your life we’re talking about. People don’t normally associate vaccines with causing serious problems, even fatalities, because vaccines for the most part are not dangerous, at least according to the numbers. About 160 million Americans get the flu shot each year, as do I, proving that I am not an anti-vaxxer. I just have questions about the COVID vaccine that I can’t really find too many people to answer. Tucker said, “Every year, a relatively small number of people seem to die after getting those shots. To be precise, in 2019, that number was 203 people. The year before, it was 119. In 2017, a total of 85 people died from the flu shot.” Out of 160 million people who get the flu shot, those numbers of people who died, every one of them being tragic to their loved ones, aren’t significant enough for the rest of us to consider not getting the flu shot. Carlson wanted to know how many people have died from getting the COVID vaccine: “We checked today. Here’s the answer, which comes from the same set of government numbers that we just listed: Between late December of 2020, and last month, a total of 3,362 people apparently died after getting the COVID vaccines in the United States. Three thousand, three hundred and sixty-two — that’s an average of 30 people every day. So, what does that add up to? By the way, that reporting period ended on April 23. We don’t have numbers past that, we’re not quite up to date. But we can assume that another 360 people have died in the 12 days since. That is a total of 3,722 deaths. Almost four thousand people died after getting the COVID vaccines. The actual number is almost certainly much higher than that — perhaps vastly higher.” [emphasis added] 99.9% Fine Silver MAGA Collector Coins! How come no one is talking about that? Do doctors and other medical personnel now instinctively know that you’re not supposed to talk about anything that violates the Woke Supremacy’s stance on COVID? This is our lives we’re talking about.  These are legitimate questions.  And these are serious concerns.  So why aren’t our “leaders” more willing to be transparent?

The Swedish Public Health Agency has developed national criteria for assessing freedom from infection in covid-19.  The Swedish Public Health Agency has developed national criteria for assessing freedom from infection in covid-19.  The PCR technology used in tests to detect viruses cannot distinguish between viruses capable of infecting cells and viruses that have been neutralized by the immune system and therefore these tests cannot be used to determine whether someone is contagious or not. RNA from viruses can often be detected for weeks (sometimes months) after the illness but does not mean that you are still contagious. There are also several scientific studies that suggest that the infectivity of covid-19 is greatest at the beginning of the disease period.  The recommended criteria for assessing freedom from infection are therefore based on stable clinical improvement with freedom from fever for at least two days and that at least seven days have passed since the onset of symptoms. For those who have had more pronounced symptoms, at least 14 days after the illness and for the very sickest, individual assessment by the treating doctor.  The criteria have been developed in collaboration with representatives of the specialty associations in infectious disease medicine, clinical microbiology, hygiene and infection control. These have most recently been discussed in the group at a meeting on 19 April 2021 due to the new virus variants. The assessment was then that no update was needed. The recommendations will be updated as new knowledge about covid-19 infectivity is added.

213,141014671670367035124127475663661746096,"As the last U.S. troops exited Afghanistan, at least 50 dogs were believed to have been left behind at the international airport in Kabul, according to animal welfare and rescue groups. The Pentagon denied that the abandoned dogs were U.S. military animals; at least one contractor was later identified as having dogs it was struggling to evacuate.  Public anger erupted after images shared online showed dozens of dogs in cages, with empty plastic water bottles strewn around and a large helicopter in the backdrop with smashed windows. Comments flew on social media accusing the U.S. government of leaving the animals in cruel conditions, while animal rights groups condemned the dogs’ abandonment.  Conservative lawmakers and commentators used the photos to excoriate the Biden administration over the withdrawal — and fueled misinformation around it.  Eric Pahon, a Defense Department spokesman, told The Washington Post that the animals pictured were under the care of Kabul Small Animal Rescue, not the U.S. military. The Pentagon said no dogs under the direct care of the U.S. military were left in cages at the Kabul airport.  Advertisement  “To correct erroneous reports, the U.S. military did not leave any dogs in cages at Hamid Karzai International Airport, to include the reported ‘military working dogs,’ ” Pahon said in a statement. “Despite an ongoing complicated and dangerous retrograde mission, U.S. forces went to great lengths to assist the Kabul Small Animal Rescue as much as possible.”  The priority mission, he said, was evacuating people such as U.S. citizens, holders of special immigrant visas and “vulnerable Afghans.”  GardaWorld, a military contractor, confirmed to the Military Times on Tuesday that it had dogs in Kabul but did not specify how many. It said it would work with Kabul Small Animal Rescue to continue evacuation efforts despite “grueling” setbacks.  “Our team has worked relentlessly with numerous dedicated charities to rescue our dogs and all the animals under KSAR’s care,” GardaWorld said in a statement to the Military Times.  The Taliban took control of the Kabul airport Aug. 31, as celebratory gunfire and fireworks echoed across the city. (Video: The Washington Post, Photo: The Washington Post)  Jason Johnson, who founded Project K-9 Hero, a U.S. charity that supports retired military working dogs, told The Post on Tuesday that military personnel and U.S. contractors in communication with his group were aware of about 50 contractor-owned animals left behind and an additional 150 or so that were a mix of pets belonging to American expats and stray animals from Kabul that KSAR had rescued and intended to send to new homes abroad.  Advertisement  Laura Sheehan, a spokesperson for the group American Humane, which has collaborated with the U.S. military on animal aid and relief efforts since World War I, had similar reports from the group’s military contacts before Monday’s evacuation.  “As far as we’ve been told, there were about 50 contract-working dogs left,” Sheehan told The Post. “Those animals would be contracted to the U.S. military to provide support,” working security, patrol and explosive detection, she said.  Sheehan added, “Given the status of the contractor dogs, the U.S. government doesn’t view those animals as its responsibility.”  It was not immediately clear why the dogs were left behind or which of the various military contractors owned the dogs. The condition of the dogs is also unknown, Johnson said. “We have no confirmation those dogs are still in crates and still alive,” he said.  Video filmed on Aug. 30 showed the last U.S. troops to leave Kabul, ending a 20-year war. (Video: Reuters, Photo: Reuters)  Thousands of Afghan and American service members and expats scrambled to flee Afghanistan after the Taliban completed its swift takeover of the country in mid-August. But evacuations became more challenging — and perilous — in the small segment of the airport that U.S. forces still controlled as President Biden’s Aug. 31 withdrawal deadline approached.  Johnson, who served as a dog handler in the Defense Department, where he worked for the U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan in 2009, expressed confidence in the Pentagon’s statement. The strength of the bond between U.S. military service animals and their handlers made him skeptical that handlers would abandon their partners.  Advertisement  “They’d be more likely to stay behind than leave without them,” Johnson said. “Dogs in Project K-9 Hero served in Afghanistan [and] saved the lives of many Marines. I don’t think we can underestimate that.”  Johnson said he was aware that other animal rescue groups are raising funds to coordinate evacuations for the remaining animals, but he expressed little confidence that those missions could succeed now that the Taliban has taken over the airport and no U.S. forces remain.  “I don’t see how you can negotiate with the Taliban,” he said.  Johnson said it would be the responsibility of the contractors and their employees to create a plan for the dogs, but he said logistics of the situation were unknown, including whether the dogs had been required for service up to the final hours of the U.S. presence at the airport.  Advertisement  The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals International (SPCAI) said Charlotte Maxwell-Jones, the founder of Kabul Small Animal Rescue, was forced to leave the airport grounds on Monday, stymieing efforts to evacuate the animals.  Maxwell-Jones described in a message to The Post on Wednesday being kicked out of the airport by U.S. forces and then taken home by Taliban fighters. “A really weird day,” she wrote. She noted that U.S. soldiers were “very kind to the dogs, helped me care for then and clean them.”  “The soldier who escorted me out was polite and sympathetic, just following orders,” she said.  She described charter flights sent to evacuate the animals being unable to land due a mangle of “bureaucratic reasons,” including overland flying rights, landing permits and the red-alert security level at the airport.  Advertisement  “Charlotte was informed that most of the KSAR dogs had to be released into the airport on August 30 as the airport was evacuated — turning once-rescued shelter dogs into homeless strays,” the SPCAI said in its statement.  Maxwell-Jones notes that the dogs were never “abandoned,” but rather “seized from me and released.”  After photos of the stranded canines sparked anger on social media, many people offered to take them in, questioned how they could have been abandoned and recounted their own experiences with dogs in conflict zones.  Other animals have been caught up in the Afghan withdrawal, with a British marine, Paul “Pen” Farthing, making global headlines as he tried to leave the country with dozens of rescue cats and dogs in an evacuation mission dubbed “Operation Ark.” Farthing landed in Britain on Sunday, but he has faced criticism for evacuating without the charity’s human staff.  Advertisement  Biden said in an address Tuesday that an estimated 100 to 200 Americans remain in Afghanistan. He characterized them as mostly dual citizens who are longtime Afghanistan residents and have not left because of family connections.  “That was the choice, the real choice — between leaving and escalating,” Biden said. “I was not going to extend this forever war, and I was not extending a forever exit.”  Read more:  GiftOutline Gift Article",Dogs abandoned at Kabul airport prompted outrage.

The group's investigation found that from 2013 to 2019, 138 people were killed and more than 70 others were beaten, sexually assaulted, extorted or tortured after they were sent back to the Central American country.  The report, released Wednesday, highlights the risks Salvadorans face when sent back to a country facing a humanitarian crisis, racked by extreme levels of violence. It emphasizes how efforts in the last few years by the Trump administration to restrict legal immigration — particularly asylum — have hit Salvadorans especially hard.  ""This has been a brick-by-brick erection of a legal wall by the Trump administration in an attempt to effectively end asylum in the U.S.,"" the report's co-author, Alison Leal Parker, told NBC News. ""Salvadorans are by no means the only nationality, but they are one of the populations that will suffer greatly from this.""  ""A living hell""  Juana, who requested that her real name not be used because of safety concerns, is a Salvadoran woman who suffered physical, sexual and emotional abuse at the hands of her partner and fled for the U.S. border with her 2-year-old daughter in 2015.  But Juana and her daughter are back in San Miguel — one of El Salvador's most violent areas — in the same neighborhood they fled nearly five years ago.  Eight percent of all homicides in El Salvador in 2018 happened in San Miguel, making it the second deadliest municipality in the country, according to the State Department's Overseas Security Advisory Council.  ""This is a very dangerous place. There's no safe place here because people get killed all the time,"" Juana told NBC News in Spanish. Gang members ""left me all beaten"" at work in April, she said, adding that it's been difficult to hold a steady job since criminals are always looking to extort and assault her.  Shortly after Juana got to the U.S., she was detained in a holding cell known as a ""hielera"" for its cold temperatures (""hielo"" is ""ice"" in Spanish), separated from her toddler and deported the following year without her child, even though she passed her credible fear interview.  ""Being separated from my daughter really affected me,"" Juana said. ""That's not a thing you can just overcome easily.""  Officials working the case found that Juana's former partner, her daughter's father, had reported her for human trafficking as part of his abuse. The Salvadoran government later determined she had not committed such a crime, and after a year and a half, Salvadoran and U.S. officials intervened to reunite mother and child.  For Salvadorans, doors are closing  Gang members shot and killed Adriana in 2017 after the U.S. dismissed her asylum claim and deported her back to El Salvador in 2015, according to the report, which changed Adriana's and other victim's real names to avoid identifying some of the people interviewed during the research.  Adriana, a former Salvadoran policewoman, was seeking asylum in the U.S. after being threatened by gangs.  The U.S. has deported many Salvadorans like her ""who flee the country because they have tried to enforce the law,"" Parker said. Typically, these are people who have worked on investigations or trials of gang members.  ""The consequences for these police officers and law enforcement can be life and death,"" Parker said.  The U.S. has been denying asylum applications from El Salvador even though the number of applicants increased from about 5,600 to over 60,000 from 2012 to 2017, a growth of nearly 1,000 percent.  A rise in asylum requests from people fleeing El Salvador suggests that the violence and human rights abuses in the country, ""including one of the highest murder rates in the world and very high rates of sexual violence and disappearances,"" have worsened, according to Human Rights Watch.

Gregory Bull / AP file  Gabriel G. was targeted by gangs for being in the Salvadoran military and unsuccessfully sought U.S. asylum. Gabriel told Human Rights Watch that he and his family are continually harassed by gang members after he was deported in 2018. The death threats are constant, he said.  Salvadorans facing deportation are often subjected to an immigration system that is ""harsh and punitive,"" plagued with court hearing backlogs and limited access to comprehensive legal advice, as well as ""prolonged and inhumane detention,"" according to the report.  Two U.S. attorney general decisions, one by Jeff Sessions and one by William Barr, narrowed the categories of people who can claim asylum in ways that particularly affect Salvadorans. The decisions limited the ability to seek asylum for those fleeing gang and gender-based violence or fleeing because a relative was assaulted or killed — all common reasons Salvadorans leave their country, according to the report.  High risk for longtime U.S. residents  The report emphasized the high risk of harm for longtime U.S. residents who return to El Salvador, what Parker called its ""most surprising"" finding. Those deportees may stick out in El Salvador as easy marks for gangs that control much of the country's territory.  Hundreds of thousands of Salvadorans could be deported from the U.S. in the coming years based on two Trump administration efforts to end immigration programs such as Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).  About 47 percent of the estimated 1.2 million Salvadorans living in the U.S. who are not citizens are in the country legally as lawful permanent residents or through TPS and DACA. The rest are undocumented.  Work authorizations for TPS holders are set to expire in January 2021 and DACA's future won't be decided until the Supreme Court rules on whether to keep or overturn Trump's decision to end the program.  Salvadoran soldiers patrol in downtown San Salvador, El Salvador, on March 15, 2017, after six market sellers were killed in the city. Jose Cabezas / Reuters file  Rollbacks of legal immigration protections make at least 900,000 Salvadorans who are undocumented, DACA or TPS holders vulnerable to deportation, subsequently ""sending them to face murder and attacks on their safety,"" Parker said.  The U.S. determined that only 18.2 percent of Salvadorans seeking asylum from 2014 to 2018 qualified for it. During the same time period, the U.S. deported 111,000 people to El Salvador, the report said.  Human Rights Watch said many of those denied asylum and sent back were later killed.  Under the one-year-old Migrant Protection Protocols, known as the ""Remain in Mexico"" policy, thousands of migrants waiting for U.S. immigration hearings have been sent to Mexico, in areas the State Department has deemed unsafe because of ""organized crime activity — including gun battles, murder, armed robbery, carjacking, kidnapping, forced disappearances, extortion and sexual assault.""  The report calls on the Trump administration, as well as lawmakers, to ""address due process failures in asylum adjudications"" and adopt laws that take into account the ""global realities prompting people to flee their homes,"" instead of implementing policies that ""shift responsibility for immigration enforcement to countries like Mexico"" to avoid obligations over migrants' safety.  ""Evidence continues to pile up showing that the U.S. government is knowingly signing a death sentence by forcibly returning vulnerable people to the very place they fled. It’s our responsibility to demand accountability, restore our asylum and refugee systems, and uphold our nation’s core values,” said Sen.Bob Menendez, D-N.J., the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, in a statement reacting to the report.  The organization also recommends implementing additional protections under international law to help people who may have been denied asylum and will likely face risk of serious harm or death upon their deportation to El Salvador.

Nevada will hold its caucuses on Saturday, Feb. 22, 2020. (Chase Stevens/Las Vegas Review-Journal)  The hiring of a top presidential candidate’s staff member to a position within the Nevada Democratic Party has increased scrutiny of the party as it works to put together a contingency plan for its Feb. 22 caucuses.  Dozens of Twitter users — most identified as supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders — on Sunday accused the Democratic Party of corruption and hurled insults at Emily Goldman, who was hired as the party’s voter protection director in January. Many called for Goldman and Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez to be fired.  Screenshots of Goldman’s LinkedIn account noted she worked as an Iowa organizer for former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg until February, when she began her new role with the Nevada Democratic Party.  Goldman, who has since switched her social media accounts to private settings, is no longer employed by or affiliated with the Buttigieg campaign.  Buttigieg defeated Sanders in a close and bitterly contested contest in Iowa last week. Sanders received more popular votes, but Buttigieg was awarded more delegates — the traditional definition of a “win” in a caucus state.  Social media users questioned the optics of hiring a candidate’s staff member ahead of running important caucuses in which that candidate is competing.  Nevada Democratic Party spokeswoman Molly Forgey said Goldman was offered the position in January, before the Iowa caucuses were underway. Goldman is not a senior staff member and will not be involved with Nevada’s caucuses, Forgey added, though she is currently working for the party.  “No staffer working at the Nevada Democratic State Party is affiliated with any campaign, and no one person has the ability to affect results,” she said Sunday. “We have many former campaign staffers and volunteers working to protect the integrity of this caucus, including people from (Sen. Kamala) Harris, Sanders and (Sen. Elizabeth) Warren’s campaign — it is not unusual or uncommon for this to happen.”  Goldman’s primary role will be assisting the party ahead of the general election in November, Forgey said.  “Everyone working at NV Dems now has the same job: executing the most transparent, accessible and expansive caucus in the country,” she said.  Assurances given  Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir and Nevada State Director Sarah Michelsen took to Twitter on Sunday in an attempt to calm Sanders’ supporters.  “We’ve spoken to the Nevada party, which has assured us that (Goldman) does not have decision-making authority over the caucus count,” Shakir said. “Please know we are working hard with the party to get every assurance that (the) mistakes of Iowa are not repeated.”  The online flurry comes as the state party is working behind closed doors to form a backup plan for reporting caucus results and training hundreds of volunteers to execute it.  Early caucusing runs from Saturday through Feb. 18. Preference cards from that period will be added to the caucus results generated on Feb. 22 to determine how many delegates each presidential candidate will earn from the Silver State.  The party revealed Tuesday it was abandoning two apps it had developed by Shadow Inc., after learning the company developed a similar app that malfunctioned during the Iowa caucuses.  On Friday, the Democrats announced they would not be using any apps on caucus day or during early voting.  ‘Working 24/7’  Over the weekend, the party held a series of training sessions for volunteers.  CBS News reported that anonymous Democratic sources said volunteers were trained on a new “tool,” which the sources stressed was not an app, to record preferences during the early caucuses. These preferences can then be used on caucus day to factor in the total support for a candidate and ultimately reward delegates.  When asked if the Democrats planned to demonstrate its caucus procedures for the public or the presidential campaigns next week, Forgey said the party is “working 24/7” to ensure what happened in Iowa does not happen in Nevada. She said the party will update the public as soon as plans are finalized.  One staff member from a presidential campaign’s local arm said the hiring of a former organizer is not as big an issue as the lack of communication between the party and the campaign. When the party does contact staff members, the communication has been “sporadic, scripted, containing little information and of limited value.”  “There’s been zero communication, zero transparency,” the staffer said. “We’re finding out more details on Twitter than we are from the party at this point.”  The party contends it has been in regular contact with the campaigns since Iowa.

The book presents an outline of what Mr. Bolton might testify to if he is called as a witness in the Senate impeachment trial, the people said. The White House could use the pre-publication review process, which has no set time frame, to delay or even kill the book’s publication or omit key passages.  Just after midnight on Monday, Mr. Trump denied telling Mr. Bolton that the aid was tied to investigations. “If John Bolton said this, it was only to sell a book,” he wrote on Twitter, reprising his argument that the Ukrainians themselves felt “no pressure” and falsely asserting that the aid was released ahead of schedule.  Over dozens of pages, Mr. Bolton described how the Ukraine affair unfolded over several months until he departed the White House in September. He described not only the president’s private disparagement of Ukraine but also new details about senior cabinet officials who have publicly tried to sidestep involvement.  For example, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo acknowledged privately that there was no basis to claims by the president’s lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani that the ambassador to Ukraine was corrupt and believed Mr. Giuliani may have been acting on behalf of other clients, Mr. Bolton wrote.  Mr. Bolton also said that after the president’s July phone call with the president of Ukraine, he raised with Attorney General William P. Barr his concerns about Mr. Giuliani, who was pursuing a shadow Ukraine policy encouraged by the president, and told Mr. Barr that the president had mentioned him on the call. A spokeswoman for Mr. Barr denied that he learned of the call from Mr. Bolton; the Justice Department has said he learned about it only in mid-August.","Trump Tied Ukraine Aid to Inquiries He Sought, Bolton Book Says",true
217,234914447320333363348498339220413315079,"Washington (CNN) A large gun-rights rally in Virginia's state capital unfolded peacefully Monday despite earlier fears of the kind of violence that took place in nearby Charlottesville three years ago.  Security was tight as gun-rights advocates descended on Richmond for ""Lobby Day"" to oppose legislation that would restrict access to firearms in the state. The commonwealth braced for the potential of extremist and white nationalist groups to disrupt the peaceful demonstrations with violence and riots, and the state's Democratic governor, Ralph Northam, declared a temporary state of emergency last week to ban open and concealed firearms and other weapons from the state capitol grounds.  The crowd, however, was peaceful, with no immediate reports of violence. One person was arrested with one felony count of wearing a mask in public. A 21-year-old woman was arrested and charged after having been warned two times not to wear a bandana over her face and then arrested when an officer saw her wearing it a third time, police said.  Some streets surrounding the capitol grounds, several of which were closed ahead of the event, were packed with protesters. About 22,000 people attended the rally, according to the Virginia Division of Capitol Police. That includes about 6,000 people in the official rally area and 16,000 outside.  Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, welcomed the fact that the day passed without serious incident.  ""Thousands of people came to Richmond to make their voices heard. Today showed that when people disagree, they can do so peacefully,"" Northam said in a statement. ""The issues before us evoke strong emotions, and progress is often difficult. I will continue to listen to the voices of Virginians, and I will continue to do everything in my power to keep our Commonwealth safe.""  In addition to the people on the capitol grounds, there was a large group outside the fenced area, which was not under the ban on weapons and is an open carry area. They were chanting ""Northam out"" and outnumbered the group on the capitol grounds. There was a heavy police presence among this crowd, and law enforcement could also be seen on the rooftops, providing extra security to the area.  Several protesters brandished rifles and held signs extolling gun rights.  ""We came unarmed ... this time,"" one read. ""Patriots unite! They ban, we fight,"" read another.

Manny Vega of Richmond, who was outside the secured area, said he and his fellow protesters were ""here to represent every citizen here that wants to keep the right to bear arms.""  Speakers at the event concluded their remarks around noon, and crowds began dispersing shortly afterwards.  Concerns about threats  JUST WATCHED Virginia governor declares temporary state of emergency Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Virginia governor declares temporary state of emergency 01:33  People began lining up around 6 a.m. ET to go through security, an hour before gates to the capitol grounds were opened. Security was very thorough, as officers went through bags and made people remove their jackets to be searched despite the frigid temperatures. Law enforcement confiscated items like lighters as people passed into the secured area.  State Capitol Police urged attendees on social media that if they ""SEE SOMETHING, SAY SOMETHING,"" and posted a list of prohibited items.  Despite fears of potential violence, President Donald Trump urged his followers to stand up to state Democrats' gun control efforts.  ""The Democrat Party in the Great Commonwealth of Virginia are working hard to take away your 2nd Amendment rights,"" Trump tweeted late Monday morning. ""This is just the beginning. Don't let it happen, VOTE REPUBLICAN in 2020!  According to Northam, law enforcement had learned of credible threats of violence surrounding Monday's rally, made from mainstream and alternative dark web channels used by violent groups and white nationalists outside of Virginia.  That led the Democratic governor to issue a temporary state of emergency last week through Tuesday, banning open and concealed firearms and other weapons from the state capitol grounds.  When announcing the ban on Wednesday, Northam said he hoped to prevent incidents like the violence that erupted three years ago at the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, which left one counter protester dead and several others injured.  On Thursday, the FBI arrested three alleged members of a white supremacist group, including two men accused of possessing a machine gun, over 1,000 rounds of ammunition and body armor parts.  Sean Restatter, 22, told CNN on the capitol grounds Monday that the protest was intended to be peaceful.  ""There might be far-right and far-left groups that might be out here today, but the vast majority of the message is 'guns save lives' and we believe in the 2nd Amendment,"" he said.  Right to gun ownership for 'law abiding citizens'  The gun rights group -- the Virginia Citizens Defense League -- who organized protests on so-called Lobby Day said their demonstrations would be peaceful and intended to draw attention to "" Second Amendment sanctuaries ,"" or what they refer to as localities that vow not to enforce ""unconstitutional"" gun laws.  One of the speakers invited by VCDL included Stephen Willeford , the man who shot and chased the shooter in the Sutherland Springs, Texas, church massacre in 2017.  The group's president, Philip Van Cleave, previously told CNN that they've been attending Lobby Day since 2003 to advocate for guns rights by ""law abiding citizens,"" and the ""grassroots"" effort hasn't had any incidents of violence.  Northam's executive order was quickly challenged in court by VCDL, the Gun Owners of America and three private individuals, who argued that the ban violated their rights under the First and Second Amendments. A judge upheld the governor's temporary ban on Thursday, leading them to file an appeal with Virginia's Supreme Court. On Friday, the Supreme Court of Virginia refused their petition, leaving Northam's ban in effect.  But since winning control of the state legislature in November, Democrats have more successfully advanced gun control measures in the 2020 legislative session.  The Virginia Senate, along party lines, approved several gun measures last week, including background checks for private firearm transfers, limiting gun purchases to one handgun a month and allowing localities to ban firearms in public during a permitted event.  The bills now head to the Virginia House of Delegates.  This story is breaking and will be updated.",Virginia gun-rights rally concludes peacefully despite earlier fears of extremist violence,true

SANNA MARIN (SDP), the Minister of Transport and Communications, made a bold working life-related proposal during a panel discussion held in conjunction with the 120th anniversary celebrations of the Social Democratic Party in Turku on Saturday.  “A four-day work week, a six-hour workday. Why couldn’t it be the next step? Is eight hours really the ultimate truth? I believe people deserve to spend more time with their families, loved ones, hobbies and other aspects of life, such as culture. This could be the next step for us in working life,” she stated.  She added at the beginning of her response that she hopes the proposal becomes a reality in the near future. Full-time employees typically work five days a week, eight hours a day in Finland.  The Left Alliance has previously proposed that a six-hour workday be trialled in Finland.  Marin’s proposal was shot down by members of the political opposition. Arto Satonen (NCP) reminded that the Research Institute of the Finnish Economy (Etla) has identified the working time extension as the most effective of the measures to promote competitiveness in recent years.  “Is the SDP living in the real world?” he asked.  Etla reported last week that the 24-hour increase in annual working time has accounted for 40 per cent of the employment impact of the still topical competitiveness pact. Adjusting working time, it explained, promotes employment and competitiveness when it either reduces labour costs or increases labour productivity.  “An eight-hour workday and a 40-hour work week have been good ideas since way back when,” Satonen told Aamulehti.  He reminded that people would not get by if their wages were reduced in accordance with the reduction in working time, meaning that the proposal would be feasibly only if wages stayed unchanged.  “But that’d raise employer costs so much that the cost of labour would become impossible,” he added.

220,216731662082457846858965475593790727125,"On Thursday, The Washington Post gave Americans an easy way to tell when Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke is in Washington, D.C.: when he’s there, his flag is flown outside the headquarters. The flag, a “bison seal on a blue banner with seven white stars for the agency’s bureaus,” is brought down when he’s away. The trick works for Deputy Secretary David Bernhardt, too, as he has a separate flag of his own.  Zinke, a former Navy SEAL commander, is riffing on a tradition that has long been observed in the U.S. Navy. And that tradition has a good reason for existing: at sea, the custom is a way to point out which ship in a group the senior leader is on.  That method can also “ensure that proper ceremonial honors are rendered to dignitaries and officers,” according to Peter C. Luebke, a historian at the U.S. Navy. And, in keeping with that sea-faring tradition, there’s guidance for flying flags ashore as well. The mast a flag is hoisted on also indicates the stature of the visitor. For instance, Luebke adds, the President’s flag has historically flown at the mainmast while a different flag for the Vice President is flown at the slightly shorter foremast.

But the U.S. didn’t invent this tradition. Like many American customs, it was originally borrowed from the nation’s erstwhile colonial overlords. The British Royal Navy has been doing something like this since at least the 17th century, “when the Duke of York flew the lord high admiral’s flag in his ship in 1665,” Luebke says.  The U.S. used the flag-raising tradition to indicate the rank of fleet commanders, squadron commanders and commodores, and added others during the Civil War. (The Army has a separate flag code.)  “The expansion of the Navy during the Civil War required reorganization of how the Navy worked,” he says. “New tasks meant new ranks needed to be added. So we had all of these ranks that we didn’t have before that deserved flags. Before the Civil War, the U.S. Navy had no admirals.”  One of the earliest examples of a federal agency head having a flag can been seen in this period, too. In 1866, a special insignia—a square blue flag with a white foul anchor in the center and four white stars at each corner—was designed to fly from the mainmast of a vessel whenever the Secretary of the Navy was aboard.

221,26108250868377124843538829549317214695,"Ever since finding that soft tissue can preserve in dinosaur fossils, paleontologist Mary Schweitzer has been asked the “Jurassic Park” question – will we ever be able to find original dinosaur DNA? And if so, could we someday recreate these awesome animals?  The answers to these questions can get pretty complicated, so Dr. Schweitzer has offered to help us understand what we currently do know about dinosaur DNA, and what may be possible.  Can we get DNA from fossils?  The question should be, “Can we get dinosaur DNA?” Bone is made up of hydroxyapatite mineral. This mineral has such a strong affinity for DNA and many proteins that it is used in modern labs sometimes to purify these molecules. Because this dinosaur bone has been sitting in the ground for 65 million years, the likelihood is high that if DNA were actively sought, it could be found, just because certain biomolecules, including DNA, stick like Velcro to the mineral. However, the challenge isn’t necessarily in finding DNA, it’s in making a strong case that the DNA is dinosaurian in origin by ruling out other sources. Is it possible that we may someday recover authentic DNA from dinosaur bone? The scientific answer is “yes”…..all things are possible until disproven. Have we disproven this possibility? No. Have we recovered “authentic” dinosaur DNA? No. Therefore, it is an open question.  How long can DNA last in the fossil record, and how can we tell for certain that it is dinosaurian, and not a modern lab contaminant or DNA that has leached in from the environment?  Scientists have proposed that DNA has a pretty short shelf-life, most saying that it is unlikely to persist as long as a million years, and surely not more than five or six million years at the most. That sort of leaves out the possibility that we will ever obtain it from dinosaurs that last walked the earth over 65 million years ago! But how did they get this number?  Some have studied DNA degradation by placing molecules of known length and composition into hot acid, and monitoring how long it takes to fall apart. They use heat and acidity as proxies for time, and declare that DNA falls apart quite rapidly. One study set out to recover DNA from progressively older fossils—from a few hundred years old, to about 8,000 years. They found that the amount of recoverable DNA declined with age, and they used this to model a ‘rate of decay.’ They then predicted, but did not test, that DNA as small as 175 base pairs was extremely unlikely to persist in Cretaceous bone. Oddly, this same study showed that age alone could not account for DNA loss or preservation.  On the other hand, we have used 4 different lines of evidence to suggest that a molecule chemically similar to DNA localizes to bone-forming cells in our bone, and is consistent with what we might expect to find, if it were dinosaurian. So, how do we tell if DNA recovered from bone is truly dinosaurian, and not contaminant?  The idea that DNA can persist that long is a long shot at best, so anyone claiming to find/recover dinosaur DNA has to meet the most stringent of criteria. We suggest the following:  DNA sequences recovered from bone should match what we would expect from other data. For example, there are over 300 characters that link dinosaurs to birds, and strongly suggest that the origin of birds lies within theropod (meat-eating) dinosaurs. So, DNA sequences obtained from dinosaurs should also follow that pattern, being more similar to bird DNA than to crocodile DNA, but clearly a little bit different from either so they can be confidently differentiated from modern sources. If DNA is original, it is likely to be highly fragmented, and difficult to analyze by our current methods, developed to sequence happy healthy DNA. If “T. rex DNA” comes in long pieces that are relatively easy to sequence, it is likely to be a contaminant. DNA is proposed to be fragile, relative to other molecules. So, if authentic DNA is present, other, more durable molecules should also be present. DNA sequence from dinosaur bone should always be accompanied by evidence, including sequences, for the persistence of other molecules that are known to be decay resistant while in bone—collagen protein, for example. If one can show DNA that is similar in sequence to avian and crocodilian DNA, and can also show collagen sequences that point to a similar evolutionary relationship, the case for “real” dinosaur DNA goes up. One should also be able to demonstrate the persistence of lipids that make up cell membranes, for example. Lipids are more resistant overall than either protein or DNA. IF DNA and proteins are shown to persist, other methods than sequence should also support this conclusion. For example, binding of proteins to specific antibodies can be used to show that protein signal is localized to the tissues, and not present in surrounding sediments. In our studies, we were able to localize a substance chemically similar to DNA inside the bone cells recovered from this T. rex, using both DNA specific stains, and antibodies to proteins associated with vertebrate DNA. Finally, and probably most importantly, for all steps of any test, adequate controls should be employed. Samples that yield DNA should be co-extracted with the sediments that surrounded the fossil, and also, all buffers and chemicals used in the lab should also be treated to the exact same conditions as the fossil bone. If these also contain the sequences of interest, then it is most likely a contaminant.  So will we ever be able to clone a dinosaur?  In one sense, cloning as is usually done in the lab involves taking a known fragment of DNA, inserting it into a bacterial plasmid, and letting that fragment of DNA replicate over and over each time the cell divides. This results in many, many copies of identical DNA from the insert–clones. In the second case, cloning involves taking the whole complement of DNA from cells within a tissue, and inserting it into viable cells from which the native nuclear material has been removed. This cell is then inserted into a host, and the donor DNA dictates the formation and development of the offspring, which are genetically identical to the donor—i.e., clones. Dolly the sheep is an example of this. When people refer to “cloning a dinosaur,” they usually mean something along these lines. However, this is an incredibly complex process, and despite the unscientific nature of it, the likelihood that we would ever be able to overcome all of the obstacles between fragments of DNA in a dinosaur bone and producing a living offspring is so incredibly small it would rank a “not possible” in my book.  But just because the likelihood of visiting a “real” Jurassic Park is miniscule it doesn’t mean that it is impossible to recover original DNA or other molecules from ancient remains. In fact, these ancient molecules have much to tell us.  Because all evolutionary change must first occur in genes (and the proteins they encode), molecules can directly inform us of evolutionary processes. We can also learn about the durability of molecules under naturally occurring conditions more directly than using lab proxies, such as heat, to estimate rates of molecular degradation. Finally, recovering molecules from fossils, including dinosaurs, yields important information on the origin and distribution of evolutionary novelties, like feathers.  We still have a lot to learn in the molecular analysis of fossils, and we should proceed with the utmost caution, never overstating the data we obtain. But there is so much we can learn from molecules preserved in fossils that we believe it is worth the effort.",What Do We Really Know About Dino DNA?,true
222,174143607709671540943758091067431545747,"ATTRIBUTION 16:30 Mapped: How climate change affects extreme weather around the world          | February 25. 2021.16:30  In the early 2000s, a new field of climate-science research emerged that began to explore the human fingerprint on extreme weather, such as floods, heatwaves, droughts and storms.  Known as “extreme event attribution”, the field has gained momentum, not only in the science world, but also in the media and public imagination. These studies have the power to link the seemingly abstract concept of climate change with personal and tangible experiences of the weather.  Scientists have published more than 350 peer-reviewed studies looking at weather extremes around the world, from heatwaves in Sweden and droughts in South Africa to flooding in Bangladesh and hurricanes in the Caribbean. The result is mounting evidence that human activity is raising the risk of some types of extreme weather, especially those linked to heat.  To track how the evidence on this fast-moving topic is stacking up, Carbon Brief has mapped – to the best of our knowledge – every extreme-weather attribution study published to date.  Carbon Brief’s analysis reveals:  – 70% of the 405 extreme weather events and trends included in the map were found to be made more likely or more severe by human-caused climate change.  – 9% of events or trends were made less likely or less severe by climate change, meaning 79% of all events experienced some human impact. The remaining 21% of events and trends showed no discernible human influence or were inconclusive.  – Of the 122 attribution studies that have looked at extreme heat around the world, 92% found that climate change made the event or trend more likely or more severe.  – For the 81 studies looking at rainfall or flooding, 58% found human activity had made the event more likely or more severe. For the 69 drought events studied, it’s 65%.  First published in July 2017, this article is the fourth annual update (see endnote) to incorporate new studies. The aim is that it serves as a tracker for the evolving field of “extreme event attribution”.  Using the map  The map above shows 405 extreme weather events and trends across the globe for which scientists have carried out attribution studies. The different symbols show the type of extreme weather; for example, a heatwave, flood or drought. The colours indicate whether the attribution study found a link to human-caused climate change (red), no link (blue) or was inconclusive (grey).  How to use our map of attribution studies.  Use the plus and minus buttons in the top-left corner, or double click anywhere, to zoom in on any part of the world. Click on a symbol to reveal more information, including a quote from the original paper to summarise the findings and a link to the online version.  The filter on the left allows users to select a specific type of weather event to look at or, for example, only those found to be influenced by climate change.  The filter can also be used to highlight extreme events from a particular year. (Note: previous versions of this map classified events by the year that the study or analysis was published.) To isolate studies that assess the changing trends of weather extremes, click the “trend” box in the filter.  The software used to make the map currently only works with a Web Mercator projection (as used by virtually all major online map providers). It is worth noting that this – like all map projections – offers a somewhat distorted view of the world.  It is important to note that the weather events scientists have studied so far are not randomly chosen. They can be high-profile events, such as Hurricane Harvey, or simply the events that occurred nearest to scientific research centres. (More on this below.)  The map includes three different types of studies. The circles and hexagons on the map indicate papers published in peer-reviewed journals. The different shapes refer to whether the study considers an individual extreme event (circles), such as a wildfire or storm, or whether it analyses longer-term trends in extreme weather (hexagons), such as the change in frequency of flooding or marine heatwaves over time.  The third shape – triangles – indicate rapid attribution studies. These are quickfire assessments of the climate change contribution to extreme weather events, published online shortly after an event concludes. (More on this below.)  Finally, it is worth noting that some of the icon locations are approximate – particularly for studies that cover large regions. For example, global studies can be found grouped together in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.  Extreme weather types  The events and trends shown on the map are covered by 357 individual scientific papers or rapid studies. Where a single study covers multiple events or locations, these have been separated out.  Combining the evidence over the past 20 years, the literature is heavily dominated by studies of extreme heat (33%), rainfall or flooding (20%) and drought (17%). Together, these make up more than two-thirds of all published studies (70%). The full list is available in this Google sheet.  As the chart below shows, the number of extreme events studied has grown substantially over the past 10-15 years. Note that formal studies typically follow a year or so after the event itself as the writing and peer-review process for journal papers can take many months.  The majority of studies included here have been published in the annual “Explaining extreme events” special issues of the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society (BAMS). Each bumper volume typically contains around 15-30 peer-reviewed studies of events from the previous year. Other studies have been found through the Climate Signals database and online searches through journals. This update includes studies published up to the beginning of February 2021.  (Note: The map currently only includes studies published in English.)  Specific types of event can be displayed in the chart below by clicking on the category names at the top.  Number of attribution studies by extreme weather event type and year. Note: the total number of events dipped in 2017 because the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society special report for that year was published in early 2018 rather than late 2017. Chart by Carbon Brief using Highcharts  Most of the categories of extreme weather are self-explanatory, but “storms” and “oceans” require a bit of explanation.  For ease of presentation, the “storms” category includes both tropical cyclones – such as hurricanes and typhoons – and extratropical storms. The “oceans” category encompasses studies looking at marine heatwaves, storm surges and the strength of El Niño events.  Two relatively new categories include “coral bleaching” and “ecosystem services”, reflecting the ongoing developments in attribution science.  For example, two studies focusing on 2016 found that El Niño and human-caused climate change combined to bring drought and poor harvests to southern Africa (pdf, p91), and that enhanced warming of sea surface temperatures increased the risk (pdf, p144) of coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef.  Damage caused by Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, September 2017. Credit: APFootage / Alamy Stock Photo  Such studies show that attribution studies are increasingly considering the impacts of extremes, rather than focusing purely on the weather event.  One of the first of these “impact attribution” studies was published in 2016. It estimated that 506 of the 735 fatalities in Paris during the 2003 European heatwave were down to the fact that climate change had made the heat more intense than it would otherwise have been. The same was true for 64 of the 315 fatalities in London, the study said. Health impacts have increasingly become a focus of attribution studies.  Similarly, research has also branched out into calculating the economic costs associated with the human contribution to extreme events. For example, a 2020 study estimated that approximately $67bn of the damages caused by Hurricane Harvey in 2017 “are attributable to the human influence on climate”.  This shift towards impacts “is quite significant”, says Prof Peter Stott, who leads the climate monitoring and attribution team at the Met Office Hadley Centre and has been a co-editor of the BAMS reports since they began in 2012. He tells Carbon Brief:  “Impacts are hard to do because you have to establish a significant link between the meteorology and the impact in question. As editors, we’ve been trying to encourage more studies on impacts because it’s the impacts rather than the meteorology per se that tends to motivate these types of study – and if we only have the attribution on the meteorological event then we only have an indirect link to the relevant impact.”  Finally, attribution research has also identified the “signal” of human influence in general indicators of climate change, such as increasing average temperature or sea level rise. Recent research has even been able to detect the fingerprint of climate change “from any single day in the observed global record since early 2012, and since 1999 on the basis of a year of data”. These types of studies have not been included in the attribution map as the focus here is on extremes.  Human influence on extreme weather  Of the attribution studies included here, scientists found that human-caused climate change has altered the likelihood or severity of an extreme weather event in 79% of cases studied (70% made more severe or likely and 9% made less so).  In Carbon Brief’s first edition of this analysis in 2017, 68% of events were found to have a human impact (with 63% made more severe or likely and 6% less so).  There are several ways of carrying out an attribution analysis. (Carbon Brief’s past articles on attribution give more information on the various methods.) One of the most common is to take observations and/or climate model simulations of an extreme event in the current climate and compare them with idealised model runs of that event in a world without human-caused global warming. The difference between the “with” and “without” climate change simulations indicates how the likelihood or severity of that extreme event has changed.  Note that events are classified here as having an human impact if climate change is found to have influenced at least one aspect of that event. For example, a study of the 2011 East Africa drought found that climate change contributed to the failure of the “long rains” in early 2011, but that the lack of “short rains” in late 2010 was down to the climate phenomenon La Niña. This event is, thus, designated as having a human impact.  For the majority of events affected by climate change, the balance has shifted in the same direction. That is, rising temperatures made the event in question more severe or more likely to occur. These events are represented by the red in the chart below. Clicking on the red “slice” reveals that heatwaves account for 43% of such events, rainfall or flooding for 17%, and droughts for 16%. Return to the original chart, and do the same with the other slices to see the proportion of different weather types in each category.  Pie chart showing the proportion of extreme events/studies that were found to have been made more likely/severe by climate change (red segment), less likely/severe (orange), had no link identified (blue) and were inconclusive or lacked sufficient data (grey). Clicking on a segment reveals the makeup of different types of extremes within that category. Chart by Carbon Brief using Highcharts  In 10% of extreme weather events and trends studied, scientists found no discernible influence from human activity. These are coloured blue in the map and the chart above. For a further 11%, the observational data or modelling techniques used in the study were insufficient to reach a reliable conclusion (shown as grey in the map and pie chart).  In 9% of studied weather events and trends, scientists found climate change had made the event less likely or less severe (pale orange in the chart above).  Unsurprisingly, this category includes blizzards and extreme cold snaps. However, it also features a few studies that suggest climate change has lessened the chances of heavy rainfall, and another that found rising temperatures have made agricultural drought in California less likely.  Drought is complicated (more on this below). Briefly, though, it is worth noting that five other studies looking at different aspects of the California drought over 2011-17 found climate change had played a role. Two found no discernible link (pdf, p7-15), while one was inconclusive (pdf, p3).  Interestingly, a 2020 study analysed the way links between climate change and the California drought were portrayed in US media. It finds that the links were “covered widely in both local and national news”, but notes:  “However, legitimate differences in the methods underpinning the attribution studies performed by different researchers often resulted in a frame of scientific uncertainty or disagreement in the media coverage.”  As the case of California’s drought shows, it is often necessary to dig deeper to understand the full picture. The rest of this article looks at the evidence for the three most-studied types of extreme weather – heatwaves, heavy rain and floods, and droughts – as well as some of the main issues in event attribution, and where the field as a whole is heading.  Heatwaves  Of the 132 attribution studies that have looked at extreme heat around the world, 122 (92%) found that climate change had made such an event more likely or more severe. No studies found a heatwave had been made less severe by climate change, while two studies (2%) identified no influence and a further eight (6%) were inconclusive.  One study suggests that the Korean heatwave in the summer of 2013 had become 10 times more likely due to climate change, for example (pdf, p48). The studies on extreme heat that did not find a role for climate change were an analysis of the Russian heatwave in 2010 and a rapid attribution study of the all-time high temperatures recorded in Rajasthan, India in May 2016. For the latter, the authors suggested that “the lack of a detectable trend may be due to the masking effect of aerosols on global warming and increased use of irrigation”.  While heatwaves are the most-studied extreme event in attribution literature, they are becoming “less and less interesting for researchers”, notes a Bloomberg article from 2020. Dr Friederike Otto is acting director of the Environmental Change Institute at the University of Oxford and co-leader of World Weather Attribution, a consortium of scientific organisations founded in 2014 to deliver “timely and scientifically reliable information on how extreme weather may be affected by climate change”. She told Bloomberg that the consortium chose not to investigate California’s record-breaking summer heatwave that year as “the evidence is so strong already”.  A particularly well-studied region for heatwaves in the literature is Australia, which accounts for 11% of the heat-related events included here. And climate change was found to play a role in all but one of the 14 Australian heat events studied. It is worth noting for that one event, however, that although the study (pdf, p145) was inconclusive for the city of Melbourne in southeast Australia, the authors did detect a human influence on extreme heat up the coast in Adelaide.  This raises a few important points. First, finding that climate change contributed to an event is not the same as saying it “caused” that event. Attribution is about working out if the likelihood or magnitude of a particular event happening now is different from what it would be in a world that was not warming.  A useful analogy – as explained in the first BAMS report in 2012 – is of a baseball player who starts taking steroids. If the player begins hitting 20% more home runs than before, it would not be possible to say for sure whether a particular home run is because of the steroids or the player’s spontaneous skill. But it is possible to say how the steroids have altered the likelihood that the player hits a home run, by comparing their current and historical performances. As the report put it:  “Given that steroids have resulted in a 20% increased chance that any particular swing of the player’s bat results in a home run, you would be able to make an attribution statement that, all other things being equal, steroid use had increased the probability of that particular occurrence by 20%.”  Another important point is that in cases where attribution science finds that climate change is making a given type of extreme weather more likely, it does not necessarily follow that the chance of experiencing that kind of weather gets incrementally higher each year. Natural variability means that there will still be ups and downs in the strength and frequency of extreme events.  Finally, there is usually a level of confidence attached to attribution results. So, while two studies might both find a role for human influence in a given weather event, the signal may be stronger for one than the other. For the purposes of this analysis, the attribution map does not distinguish between high- and low-confidence results, but users can click through to each study for more details.  Heavy rain and flooding  Of the 81 studies to look at rainfall or flooding, 47 (58%) found human activity had made the event more likely or more severe – a far smaller proportion than for heat-related studies. Nine studies (11%) found that climate change had made the whole event less likely to occur. Of the remaining studies on heavy rainfall, 15 (19%) found no evidence of a link to climate change while 10 (12%) were inconclusive.  That there is a more divided set of results for extreme rainfall than for heatwaves could suggest several things. In some cases, limited data might make it difficult to detect a clear “signal” of climate change above the “noise” of weather considered normal for a particular region. In other cases, an inconclusive result could reflect the fact that rainfall or flooding events are inherently more complex than heatwaves, with many ways for natural variability to play a role. Human factors, such as land use and drainage, also play a part in whether heavy rain leads to flooding.

While one study found climate change had increased the risk of floods in England and Wales in Autumn 2000 by at least 20% (and even up to 90%), another found little influence on summer rainfall in 2012 (pdf, p36).  This raises another important point. When it comes to interpreting the results of event attribution studies, it matters what the question is. For example, a 2013 study asked whether recent wet summers in northwestern European were a response to retreating Arctic sea ice (pdf, p32). The answer from the study was “no”. But, as a foreword from that year’s BAMs report explains:  “Given the numerous ways climate change could influence precipitation in this region, a ‘no’ result for the role of Arctic sea ice should not be interpreted as an absence of any role at all for climate change.”  This is similar to an argument made by Dr Kevin Trenberth, distinguished senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, and colleagues in a Nature Climate Change “perspective” article in 2015.  The paper notes that, in a chaotic weather system, the complex dynamics of the atmosphere mean the size and path of a storm or heavy rainfall event has a large element of chance. This can make it tricky to identify where climate change fits in, potentially underestimating its influence.  Therefore, rather than analysing the weather patterns that bring a storm to an area, the authors argue that scientists should be looking at how the impact of that storm has been boosted by temperature changes – known as “thermodynamic” effects. Higher temperatures mean warmer seas, higher sea levels and more moisture evaporating into the atmosphere. These are changes that scientists can be more confident in, the authors write, and so should be the focus for attribution studies – rather than looking at changes to circulation patterns in the atmosphere.  For example, the paper reexamines an earlier study (pdf, p15) that suggested climate change had reduced the chances of the five-day heavy rainfall event that hit north-east Colorado in September 2013. Trenberth and colleagues argue that while climate change might not have made the specific weather system that brought the rain more likely, it will have contributed to the sheer volume of moisture in the atmosphere.  Chart shows the number of studies for each type of extreme event that fall within each category of human influence: More severe/likely (red), less severe/likely (yellow), no influence (blue) and inconclusive (grey). Chart by Carbon Brief using Highcharts  While attribution studies of heatwaves are generally more straightforward than storms – as they focus on thermodynamic influences – the type of question they are asking is still important. The Russian heatwave in 2010 is a good example of this. One study looking at the severity of the event did not find a role for climate change. Yet another one, which did find an influence, looked at the likelihood of the event.  This apparent contradiction is tackled by a third study that reconciles the other two. It explains that “the same event can be both mostly internally‐generated [i.e. by natural variability] in terms of magnitude and mostly externally‐driven [i.e. by human-caused climate change] in terms of occurrence‐probability”.  Otto, who is lead author of the third study, tells Carbon Brief:  “The studies, thus, only appear to be contradictory, but are, in fact, complementary.”  It is also important to stress that the absence of evidence for a link to climate change is not the same as evidence of absence. In other words, it does not necessarily mean there was no human influence, just that a particular analysis did not find one. This is why a single study should never be considered the final word on how climate change influences a given type of extreme weather.  Drought  Of the 69 drought events and trends considered here, 65% found that climate change had increased the severity or likelihood of it occurring, while 1% found that climate change had seen a decrease. A further 19% of studies found no discernible link with human activity, while 14% were inconclusive.  This mixed bag of results reflects the inherent complexity of droughts. And, again, the specific question matters. Conclusions about the role of climate change in a specific drought could depend on whether a study looks at temperature, precipitation or soil moisture, for example.  As the 2015 BAMS report explains:  “Drought continues to be an event type where the results require significant context, and easy answers often remain elusive because of the many meteorological, hydrological, and societal drivers that combine to cause drought.”  Geographical reach  While much has been achieved in the field of extreme event attribution in a short space of time, scientists are constantly looking for ways to tailor their work to suit the people who might use it.  One major goal since the early days of the field has been to expand extreme event attribution to cover a larger and more diverse geographical area.  Where in the world scientists can carry out attribution studies – and for what kind of events – will always be limited by the quality and availability of observed data and appropriate models. The attribution map highlights, for example, that there are relatively few studies of extreme weather in Africa and South America.  But, at the moment, there is also a heavy leaning towards weather events that are local to the modelling groups, or that have a particular scientific interest. Otto explains:  “For example, scientists often do attribution studies because an event occurs on their doorstep. The UK, California and Boulder [in Colorado] are, therefore, studied much more than other parts of the world, but that does not necessarily make them places particularly impacted by climate change.”  This means that while the studies carried out so far are indicative of the role climate change is playing in extreme weather around the world, they should not be considered representative of all types of extreme weather everywhere, says Otto. She tells Carbon Brief:  “[The studies so far] are part of a picture, but we don’t know what’s on the missing puzzle pieces. And, crucially, we don’t know how many pieces are missing.”  For example, Otto recently penned a Carbon Brief guest post on how the lack of monitoring of heatwaves in Africa means they are a “forgotten impact” of climate change.  Real-time extreme weather attribution  As well as expanding the science to cover different types of weather and more of the world, scientists are getting faster at turning the handle on extreme event attribution studies – sometimes crunching the numbers just days after an event has occurred.  The rapid studies included here are all – bar one – produced by the World Weather Attribution (WWA) initiative, described earlier. The exception is the analysis carried out by the Met Office for their review of the UK’s weather in 2020, which was published by Carbon Brief. This showed that climate change increased the likelihood of the UK’s warm year by approximately a factor of 50.  While the WWA individual rapid assessments are not individually peer-reviewed, they are conducted using methods that have been through the peer-review process. As the 2014 BAMS report explains:  “Much like other routine analysis, such as an operational seasonal forecast, statements made about heat events using these methods do not necessarily need to go through the peer-reviewed literature to be considered credible.”  By conducting the analysis in the immediate aftermath of a weather event, these rapid studies provide almost-real-time information on the climate change influence, rather than having to wait many months for a formal study.  (In some cases, these rapid assessments are later published in peer-reviewed journals. In these cases, the formal study is included in the attribution map, rather than the initial analysis. In some cases, this means earlier rapid assessments are removed from the Carbon Brief map in order to add in the relevant peer-reviewed paper once it is published.)  Canoeist at the flooded Worcester Racecourse, UK. December 2013. Credit: PetaPix / Alamy Stock Photo  The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) is currently working on a pilot “operational attribution service” through the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S).  This collaboration between the UK Met Office, German weather service (DWD), Meteo France, Dutch weather service (KNMI) and the University of Oxford will “demonstrate how attribution of extreme weather events can be carried out operationally by national meteorological services”, Prof Stott tells Carbon Brief:  “In this project we are developing and testing the protocols we will need to enable rapid and reliable assessments of the extent to which recent extreme weather events have been made more or less intense or more or less likely by climate change. We started at the beginning of the year and so far we have tested our procedures on an analysis of the 2018 heatwave in Europe.”  The progress to date has “demonstrated the importance of international collaboration for developing new techniques and processes”, says Stott. But “national meteorological services across Europe will continue to have a particular remit to deliver advice on weather and climate in their own countries”, he adds:  “At the Met Office in the UK we are developing our operational attribution capability to help inform the public, policymakers and journalists about the extent to which damaging extreme weather events like the floods in Yorkshire last autumn have been affected by climate change.”  An evolving science  As the science of extreme event attribution has matured and become more nuanced, so has the choice of terminology around extreme weather and climate change.  While some attest that all extreme weather must be affected by a world that is warming, this warrants some caution. As the first BAMS report in 2012 noted:  “While it has been argued that in the Anthropocene, all extreme weather or climate events that occur are altered by human influence on climate…this does not mean that climate change can be blamed for every extreme weather or climate event. After all, there has always been extreme weather.”  But while it would be premature to suggest that any single study is the last word, it is clear that – in many cases – the science can do better than that. Similarly, scientific thinking has clearly moved on from the unsatisfactory statement that it is not possible to attribute any individual weather event to climate change.

Indeed, there have been some studies that concluded an event – or aspect of an event – would have been “virtually impossible” or “could not have been so severe” without climate change. As one Arctic sea ice study from 2016 puts it:  “The 2012 Arctic sea ice minimum provides a counterexample to the often-quoted idea that individual extreme events cannot be attributed to human influence.”  Ultimately, there are no blanket rules in attribution. Scientists need to examine the circumstances of each individual weather event – or a longer pattern of events for trend studies. It is only by combining evidence from all around the world that they can begin to draw broader conclusions.  Attribution studies, therefore, rely heavily on the quality and availability of observational data and climate model simulations. In a short paper for the journal Weather, the University of Oxford’s Dr Otto says that “the models used for attribution need to be able to reliably estimate the likelihoods of the types of events being attributed”.  As discussed earlier, attribution studies of heatwaves tend to be more straightforward because of their focus on thermodynamic effects, rather than atmospheric circulation. Yet, Otto tells Carbon Brief that recent studies suggest models overestimate the year-to-year variability of heat extremes in some parts of the world, and thus underestimate the trend and the role of climate change.  In a rapid attribution study of the western Europe summer heatwave in 2019, for example, Otto and her colleagues found that, for the month of June, the models “show about 50% smaller trends than observations in this part of Europe and much higher year-to-year variability than the observations”. Similarly, a study of the 2019-20 Australian bushfires noted that “the models underestimate the observed trend in heat, the real increase could be much higher”.  These findings emphasise how important it is to analyse models and observations together, Otto says:  “This made me realise just how important attribution is for the scientific community – and everyone using climate science – at bringing observations and models together in a very concrete real-world test case.  Attribution can, therefore, be used to help scientists “identify where the models are doing well and for what they are not in a much more direct way than the classical skill assessment of climate projections does”, adds Otto.  Forecasted attribution  One attempt to move attribution science forward was the very first “advance forecasted” attribution analysis, which quantified the impact of climate change on the size, rainfall, and intensity of Hurricane Florence before it made landfall in North Carolina in September 2018.  The analysis ran two sets of short-term forecasts for the hurricane: one as the climate is today and the other in a simulated world without human-caused climate change. The researchers concluded at the time:  “We find that rainfall will be significantly increased by over 50% in the heaviest precipitating parts of the storm. This increase is substantially larger than expected from thermodynamic considerations alone. We further find that the storm will remain at a high category on the Saffir­-Simpson scale for a longer duration and that the storm is approximately 80km in diameter larger at landfall because of the human interference in the climate system.”  The analysis received a mixed reaction. Prof Stott told Carbon Brief that it was “quite a cool idea”, but would be dependent on being able to forecast such events reliably. Dr Kevin Trenberth, distinguished senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, described it as “a bit of a disaster”. He told Carbon Brief that the quality of the forecast was questionable for the assessment:  “The forecasts made were not good: the intensity of the forecast storm at landfall was category 4 or 5 as I recall, instead of category 2. And so the statements made were based on quite flawed assumptions: namely, that they had a good forecast.”  A key requirement for a reliable attribution study is for models to accurately replicate the extreme event, Trenberth added, but “obviously one can not assess the goodness of the forecast if one does this in advance”.

The authors subsequently published a paper in Science Advances that “reviews the forecasted attribution with the benefit of hindsight”. The findings show that climate change increased rainfall amounts “associated with the forecasted storm’s core” by around 5%, and contributed to Hurricane Florence being “about 9km larger in mean maximum diameter (or a 1.6% increase in storm area) due to climate change”.  The authors acknowledge that the “quantitative aspects of our forecasted attribution statements fall outside broad confidence intervals of our hindcasted statements and are quite different from the hindcasted best estimates”. In short, the results are quite a way off what they forecasted.  However, the authors also say they have identified what went wrong with their forecasted analysis. Problems with the way their “without climate change” model runs were set up created a larger contrast against their real-world simulations. The results thus suggested that climate change would have a bigger impact than it actually did.  Nonetheless, the study does identify a quantifiable impact of climate change on Hurricane Florence, adding to the evidence from studies by other author groups, the researchers conclude: “As the climate continues to warm, it is expected that extreme tropical cyclone precipitation events and resulting inland flooding will become yet more frequent.”  And this is reflected in the other studies presented in this map, which suggest that of the extreme weather events scientists have studied so far, climate change has made 70% of them more likely or more damaging. The majority of these events have been heatwaves, but the fingerprint of climate change has also been felt on drought, heavy rain, wildfires and, indeed, even tropical cyclones.  Finally, as well as casting forwards, attribution can also look back in time. A 2020 study on the US “Dust Bowl” heat and drought events of the 1930s takes an unconventional approach of looking at how the past event “would behave” with present-day levels of greenhouse gases.  The researchers find that “the return period of a 1-in-100-year heatwave summer (as observed in 1936) would be reduced to about 1-in-40 years” in today’s climate.  Carbon Brief aims to periodically add new extreme event attribution studies to our map and accompanying analysis as they are published.

223,306019443667925425774090865549587971005,"(CNN) For the first time on record, precipitation on Saturday at the summit of Greenland — roughly two miles above sea level — fell as rain and not snow.  Temperatures at the Greenland summit over the weekend rose above freezing for the third time in less than a decade. The warm air fueled an extreme rain event that dumped 7 billion tons of water on the ice sheet, enough to fill the Reflecting Pool at the National Mall in Washington, DC, nearly 250,000 times.  It was the heaviest rainfall on the ice sheet since record keeping began in 1950, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center , and the amount of ice mass lost on Sunday was seven times higher than normal for this time of year.  Ted Scambos, a senior research scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado, said this is evidence Greenland is warming rapidly.  ""What is going on is not simply a warm decade or two in a wandering climate pattern,"" Scambos told CNN. ""This is unprecedented.""

224,281399759898937811952217290761054542063,"The Amazon rainforest is most likely now a net contributor to warming of the planet, according to a first-of-its-kind analysis from more than 30 scientists.  For years, researchers have expressed concern that rising temperatures, drought, and deforestation are reducing the capacity of the world’s largest rainforest to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and help offset emissions from fossil-fuel burning. Recent studies have even suggested that some portions of the tropical landscape already may release more carbon than they store.  But the inhaling and exhaling of CO2 is just one way this damp jungle, the most species-rich on Earth, influences the global climate. Activities in the Amazon, both natural and human-caused, can shift the rainforest’s contribution in significant ways, warming the air directly or releasing other greenhouse gases that do.  Drying wetlands and soil compaction from logging, for example, can increase emissions of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide. Land-clearing fires release black carbon, small particles of soot that absorb sunlight and increase warmth. Deforestation can alter rainfall patterns, further drying and heating the forest. Regular flooding and dam-building releases the potent gas methane, as does cattle ranching, one chief reason forests are destroyed. And roughly 3.5 percent of all methane released globally comes naturally from the Amazon’s trees.  Yet no team had ever tried to assess the cumulative impact of these processes, even as the region is being rapidly transformed. The research, supported by the National Geographic Society and published today in Frontiers in Forests and Global Change, estimates that atmospheric warming from all of these sources combined now appears to swamp the forest’s natural cooling effect.  “Cutting the forest is interfering with its carbon uptake; that’s a problem,” says lead author Kristofer Covey, a professor of environmental studies at New York’s Skidmore College. “But when you start to look at these other factors alongside CO2, it gets really hard to see how the net effect isn’t that the Amazon as a whole is really warming global climate.”  The damage can still be reversed, he and his colleagues say. Halting global emissions from coal, oil, and natural gas would help restore balance, but curbing Amazon deforestation is a must, along with reducing dam building and increasing efforts to replant trees. Continuing to clear land at current rates appears certain to make warming worse for the entire world.  “We have this system that we have relied on to counter our mistakes, and we have really exceeded the capacity of that system to provide reliable service,” says co-author Fiona Soper, an assistant professor at McGill University.  A complicated ledger  The same richness that makes the Amazon so wonderfully biodiverse, home to tens of thousands of insects per square mile, makes understanding it extremely hard. Shimmering green leaves suck CO2 from the sky, converting it through photosynthesis into carbohydrates that end up in woody trunks and branches as trees grow. In trees and carbon-rich soils, the Amazon stores the equivalent of four or five years worth of human-made carbon emissions, up to 200 gigatons of carbon.  But the Amazon is also super wet, with floodwaters rising dozens of feet a year across the forest floor. Microbes in those drenched soils make methane, which is 28 to 86 times more potent as a greenhouse gas than CO2. Trees act like smokestacks, channeling that methane to the atmosphere.  Meanwhile, moisture from the Atlantic Ocean that falls as rain gets sucked up by plants, used for photosynthesis, and exhaled by leaves through the same pores that take up CO2. Back in the atmosphere, it falls as rain again.  Humans complicate these natural cycles not just through climate change but through logging, reservoir-building, mining, and agriculture. Deforestation in Brazil has exploded in recent years, hitting a 12-year high in 2020, increasing nearly 10 percent from the year before.  Some of these processes draw down greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, while others cause the gases to rise, and they all influence one another. But until recently, no had attempted to understand that balance. “It’s this system of interacting parts, and they’re all measured in different ways, on different time scales, by different people,” Soper says.  What’s clear is that the forest has been changing fast and in alarming ways. Rain now falls in massive bursts more frequently than it once did, triggering record floods. Droughts come more often and, in some areas, last longer. Trees that fare better in wet places are being outcompeted by tall, drought-tolerant species. Illegally set fires are on the rise again. About 5.4 million acres burned in 2019, an area roughly the size of New Jersey.  So, in 2019, the National Geographic Society brought Covey, Soper, and a team of other Amazon experts together to begin trying to dissect how all of these pieces fit together. They didn’t take new measurements—they looked for new ways to analyze existing data with an eye toward a comprehensive picture.  Looking beyond CO2  While the results include some uncertainty, they make clear that focusing on a single metric—CO2—simply doesn’t paint an accurate picture. “As important as carbon is in the Amazon, it’s not the only thing that’s going on,” says Tom Lovejoy, a senior fellow in biodiversity with the United Nations Foundation, who has worked in the Brazilian Amazon for decades. “The only surprise, if you can call it that, is how much more there is when you add it all up.”  Resource extraction, damming rivers, and the conversion of forest for soybean and livestock production all alter the natural systems in a variety of ways. But most serve to warm the climate. Methane is a particularly important player. While the largest sources of methane are still from natural forest processes, the Amazon’s capacity to take up carbon used to do far more to offset its methane emissions. Humans have diminished that capacity.  Rob Jackson, an earth systems scientist at Stanford University and a leading expert on global greenhouse emissions, considers the new research a worthwhile contribution. “The Amazon is vulnerable, and we tend to get tunnel vision about one greenhouse gas alone,” he says.  Patrick Megonigal, associate director of research at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center, agreed. “What the authors do that’s important is to expand the conversation beyond carbon dioxide, which is what 90 percent of public conversation is centered around,” he says.  “CO2 is not a lone actor. When you consider the whole cast of other characters, the outlook in the Amazon is that the impacts of human activities will be worse than we realize.”  Many questions remain. The biggest for Megonigal is one that Lovejoy also worries about: How do all of these factors influence the local Amazon climate? That’s important because the Amazon supplies much of its own moisture, with a single water molecule cycling through the forest five or more times as moist air moves from the Atlantic west over the continent.  A recent analysis by Lovejoy and Carlos Nobre, a climate scientist with the University of São Paulo's Institute for Advanced Studies, suggests that rising deforestation might so alter the flow of that moisture that it could push large stretches of the Amazon toward a permanent transition to a drier woodland savanna. The duo believes that tipping point could be reached if as little as 20 to 25 percent of the rainforest is cleared.  That would spell big trouble for the climate, substantially reducing even more the forests’ potential to scrub the skies of some of our fossil-fuel emissions. By the Brazilian government’s own measure, forest clearing already tops 17 percent.  What happens in Brazil (and neighboring countries in the Amazon) affects the whole world. In the United States, a group of environmental leaders from four previous presidential administrations, both Democratic and Republican—Bush senior, Clinton, Bush junior, and Obama—recently called on President Joe Biden to demand that Brazil’s government reduce deforestation. They urged Biden to use trade with the U.S. as leverage.  Brazil and the U.S. are currently in negotiations.

225,276636478297642485712799006348928474203,"Colorado’s shrinking mountain snowpack — at 66 percent of normal statewide Thursday — forced an expanded federal drought designation covering nearly a quarter of the state with stream flows forecast at half of average, setting off a scramble to secure water supplies.  The scarcity spurred calls for storing more water in reservoirs to sustain the state’s growth boom.  “There’s going to be people without water,” especially in Southern Colorado, U.S. Department of Agriculture snow survey supervisor Brian Domonkos said. “It’s going to be a tight year.”  Denver Water officials planned to pull more of the H2O they deliver to 1.4 million metro residents from northern mountains because the upper South Platte River basin snowpack they rely on remains low. They’re seeking federal approval to expand storage by 77,000 acre-feet in Gross Reservoir west of Boulder, a controversial project.  State agencies, including Gov. John Hickenlooper’s staffers, have been monitoring drought impacts and weighing responses with an eye toward tapping federal drought funds. They also may activate a program to ensure sufficient stream flows for protecting imperiled fish.  “We’re very closely monitoring the situation for impacts to make decisions about what we need to do next,” said Colorado Water Conservation Board climate change specialist Taryn Finnessey.  “Water providers are concerned. Those who have more storage are in a better position than those who rely more on direct flows,” she said. “This is something everybody from the agency level up to the governor’s office is closely watching to make sure we are ready to respond.”  Federal snow-survey data showed paltry snowpack statewide and less than 50 percent of median in southern areas.This means less water will flow into streams and rivers as snow melts. Snowpack in the South Platte River basin crucial for Colorado agriculture measured 83 percent of the norm. Snowpack was at 77 percent in the upper Colorado River basin. And snowpack at 57 percent in the Arkansas River basin and 55 percent in the Gunnison River basin was the lowest in 38 years.  Stream and river flows across Colorado likely will diminish to about 50 percent of average, according to federal flow forecasts. While the peak spring runoff flows in the South Platte and Colorado river basins were expected to reach 80 percent of the norm, the federal forecasts indicated flows will be as low as 25 percent of average along the Gunnison and at reservoirs near Durango and Paonia.  Federal drought monitoring officials on Thursday expanded the extreme drought designations in southern Colorado to cover about 24 percent of the state. Counties adjacent to New Mexico now are eligible for federal drought aid. The drought index showed 90 percent of Colorado under abnormally dry conditions with 74 percent of the state designated in moderate to extreme drought.  For metro Denver residents, the low snowpack, about 70 percent of the norm at the south end of Denver Water’s collection system, which holds 90 percent of metro Denver’s water supply, means heavier than usual reliance on runoff water from northern areas, where snowpack is thicker.  That’s not ideal but will help ensure steady water, utility officials said, adding that stream flows this year may not be sufficient to fill reservoirs.  “This year’s imbalance underscores the need to expand Gross Reservoir, which is Denver Water’s major storage reservoir on the north end of our system,” said Denver Water chief executive Jim Lochhead. “The expansion will help to ensure we’re less vulnerable during years like this and better prepared for events like forest fires and infrastructure failures on the south.”  Northern Water officials who supply cities and farmers north of metro Denver were planning to draw down reservoirs, where they have saved up 25 percent more water than usual for this time of year.  “We’re better off than other parts of the state, but our snowpack is still 20 percent below normal,” said Northern Water spokesman Brian Werner. “How much precipitation are we going to get? Spring storms are going to make or break this season for us.”  “We will release water from our storage. That’s why you have storage. This year’s conditions really emphasize the value of storage. Down the road, this state is going to have to have additional storage. And we will have to reuse more water. And there will have to be increased conservation.”  More than 80 percent of the water that Colorado residents divert from streams and rivers is used to irrigate crops. People in urban areas use about 10 percent. The oil and gas industry uses less than half a percent for the hydraulic fracturing that speeds extraction of fossil fuels by injecting water, sand and chemicls underground.  That leaves diminishing water for aquatic life — especially during dry times.  Colorado officials have developed a program with the Colorado Water Trust to purchase water that farmers and cities with rights to water are entitled to divert and then leave that water in streams and rivers. The idea is to release flows from reservoirs strategically to benefit ecosystems when water flows otherwise could disappear.  “We have that option,” the Colorado Water Conservation Board’s Finnessey said. “It keeps more water in the rivers for environmental purposes and water rights holders are compensated. Higher flows help maintain healthy river ecosystems. The endangered fish species in Colorado are always a concern.”  Conservation groups back that effort and on Thursday raised concerns that near-record low snowpack in Colorado will lead to degraded fish habitat and warmer water temperatures.  “Colorado’s legislators and water leaders need to continue to develop tools that allow irrigators and other water users the flexibility to use water in creative ways, including leaving it in streams during dry years like this,” said Trout Unlimited director David Nickum.  “We’ll be depending on these programs more and more,” he said, “as rivers face pressure from growing demands, changing climate and droughts.”  UPDATED: This story was updated at 10:34 a.m. on April 6, 2018, to add context to a quote from U.S. Department of Agriculture snow survey supervisor Brian Domonkos.","Colorado's mountain snowpack shrinks to 66 percent of normal, feds sound drought alarm",true
226,15620225762599030713069429847024020801,"Thermodynamics is the branch of physics that deals with the relationships between heat and other forms of energy. In particular, it describes how thermal energy is converted to and from other forms of energy and how thermal energy affects matter.  Thermal energy is the energy a substance or system has due to its temperature — in other words, the energy of moving or vibrating molecules — according to the University of Kentucky (opens in new tab). Thermodynamics involves measuring this energy, which can be ""exceedingly complicated,"" David McKee, a professor of physics at Missouri Southern State University told Live Science. ""The systems that we study in thermodynamics … consist of very large numbers of atoms or molecules interacting in complicated ways. But, if these systems meet the right criteria, which we call equilibrium, they can be described with a very small number of measurements or numbers. Often this is idealized as the mass of the system, the pressure of the system, and the volume of the system, or some other equivalent set of numbers.""  Heat  Thermodynamics, then, is concerned with several properties of matter; foremost among these is heat. Heat is energy transferred between substances or systems due to a temperature difference between them, according to Georgia State University (opens in new tab). As a form of energy, heat is conserved — it cannot be created or destroyed. It can, however, be transferred from one place to another. Heat can also be converted to and from other forms of energy. For example, a steam turbine can convert heat to kinetic energy to run a generator that converts kinetic energy to electrical energy. A light bulb can convert this electrical energy to electromagnetic radiation (light), which, when absorbed by a surface, is converted back into heat. Throughout this process, a portion of the energy is lost to entropy.  Temperature  Comparing the freezing and melting points of water (in Celsius). (Image credit: Why Design via Shutterstock)  The amount of heat transferred by a substance depends on the speed and number of atoms or molecules of that substance in motion, according to Georgia State University (opens in new tab). The faster the atoms or molecules move, the higher the temperature, and the more atoms or molecules that are in motion, the greater the quantity of heat they transfer.  Temperature is ""a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a sample of matter, expressed in terms of units or degrees designated on a standard scale,"" according to the American Heritage Dictionary (opens in new tab). The most commonly used temperature scale is Celsius, which is based on the freezing and boiling points of water, assigning respective values of 0 C and 100 C. The Fahrenheit scale is also based on the freezing and boiling points of water, which have assigned values of 32 degrees Fahrenheit and 212 F, respectively.  Scientists worldwide, however, use the Kelvin (K with no degree sign) scale, named after William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, because it's based on total thermal energy rather than the freezing and boiling points of water, according to the National Library of Scotland (opens in new tab). This scale uses the same increments as the Celsius scale; for example, a temperature change of 1 C is equal to 1 K. However, the Kelvin scale starts at absolute zero, the temperature at which there is a total absence of heat energy, and all molecular motion stops. A temperature of 0 K is equal to minus 459.67 F or minus 273.15 C.  Specific heat  The amount of heat required to increase the temperature of a certain mass of a substance by a certain amount is called specific heat, or specific heat capacity, according to Wolfram Research (opens in new tab). The conventional unit for this is calories per gram per Kelvin. The calorie is defined as the amount of heat energy required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water at 4 C by 1 degree.  The specific heat of a metal depends almost entirely on the number of atoms in the sample and the way they bond, not the sample's mass. For instance, a kilogram of aluminum can absorb about seven times more heat than a kilogram of lead. A given mass of water, however, can absorb nearly five times as much heat as an equal mass of aluminum, thanks to the strong forces binding the water molecules, according to Southeastern Louisiana University (opens in new tab).  Thermal conductivity  A central processing unit (CPU) is an essential part of a computer's hardware components. (Image credit: Narumon Bowonkitwanchai via Getty Images)  Thermal conductivity (k) is ""the rate at which heat passes through a certain cross-section of a specified material,"" according to Debdatta Ratna's ""Thermosets"" (opens in new tab) (Woodhead Publishing limited, 2012). The unit for k is watts (W) per meter (m) per Kelvin (K), according to Swarthmore College (opens in new tab). Values of k for metals such as copper and silver are relatively high at 380 and 420 W/m·K, respectively. This property makes these materials useful for automobile radiators and cooling fins for computer chips because they can carry away heat quickly and exchange it with the environment. The highest value of k for any natural substance is diamond at 2,200 W/m·K, according to a 2009 study published in the journal Materials (opens in new tab).  Other materials are useful because they are extremely poor conductors of heat; this property is referred to as thermal resistance, or R-value, which describes the rate at which heat is transmitted through the material. These materials, such as fiberglass, goose down, and Styrofoam, are used for insulation in exterior building walls, winter coats, and thermal coffee mugs. R-value is given in units of square feet times degrees Fahrenheit times hours per British thermal unit (opens in new tab) (ft2·°F·h/Btu), according to OpenStax (opens in new tab), an open-source textbook.  Newton's Law of Cooling  In 1701, Sir Isaac Newton first stated his Law of Cooling in a short article titled ""Scala graduum Caloris"" (opens in new tab) (""A Scale of the Degrees of Heat"") in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society. Newton's statement of the law translates from the original Latin as, ""the excess of the degrees of the heat ... were in geometrical progression when the times are in an arithmetical progression."" Worcester Polytechnic Institute (opens in new tab) gives a more modern version of this scientific law as ""the rate of change of temperature is proportional to the difference between the temperature of the object and that of the surrounding environment.""  This results in an exponential decay (opens in new tab) in the temperature difference. For example, if a warm object is placed in a cold bath, within a certain length of time, the difference between the two temperatures will decrease by half. Then in that same length of time, the remaining difference will again decrease by half. This repeated halving of the temperature difference will continue at equal time intervals until it becomes too small to measure. At that point, the system is in thermal equilibrium.  Heat transfer  Diagram showing how heat transfer works. (Image credit: blueringmedia via Getty Images)  Heat can be transferred from one body to another or between a body and the environment by three different means: conduction, convection, and radiation. Conduction is the transfer of energy through a solid material. Conduction between bodies occurs when they are in direct contact, and molecules transfer their energy across the interface.  Convection is the transfer of heat to or from a fluid medium. Molecules in a gas or liquid in contact with a solid body transmit or absorb heat to or from that body and then move away, allowing other molecules of the fluid to move into place and repeat the process.  Radiation is the emission of energy via electromagnetic (EM) radiation, particularly infrared photons that carry heat energy. All matter emits and absorbs some EM radiation, the net amount of which determines whether this causes a loss or gain in heat, according to Northwestern University (opens in new tab).  The Carnot cycle  In 1824, Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot (opens in new tab) proposed a model for a heat engine based on what has come to be known as the Carnot cycle, according to the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (opens in new tab). The cycle exploits the relationships among pressure, volume, and temperature of gases, as well as how an input of energy can change form and do work outside the system.  The first step in the Carnot cycle is isothermal expansion, where a gas in a cylinder under pressure from a piston is kept at a constant temperature, but a heat source is brought in contact with the cylinder. To maintain the same temperature, the gas must expand. Next, adiabatic expansion, or expansion without heat transfer to the surrounding environment, removes weight from the piston to allow the gas to expand further, which helps it push on a cylinder to do work. Next, the gas is cooled at a constant temperature and compressed by adding weight to the piston to raise the pressure in the gas, at which point heat transfers from the gas back to the heat source. And finally, adiabatic compression adds more weight to the piston to further increase the pressure of the gas and, therefore, increase its temperature. Then the cycle repeats, according to NASA (opens in new tab). This is the basic principle behind heat pumps used for heating, air conditioning, and refrigeration, according to Georgia State University (opens in new tab).  Entropy  All thermodynamic systems generate waste heat. This waste results in an increase in entropy, which is a measure of the disorder of a system. Because work comes from ordered molecular motion, entropy is a measure of the energy that's not available to do work, according to Britannica (opens in new tab). Entropy in any closed system always increases; it never decreases. Additionally, moving parts produce waste heat due to friction, and radiative heat inevitably leaks from the system.  This makes so-called perpetual motion machines impossible. Siabal Mitra, a professor of physics at Missouri State University, told Live Science ""You cannot build an engine that is 100% efficient, which means you cannot build a perpetual motion machine. However, there are a lot of folks out there who still don't believe it, and there are people who are still trying to build perpetual motion machines.""  Entropy is also defined as ""a measure of the disorder or randomness in a closed system,"" which also inexorably increases. You can mix hot and cold water, but because a large cup of warm water is more disordered than two smaller cups containing hot and cold water, you can never separate it back into hot and cold without adding energy to the system. Put another way, you can't unscramble an egg or remove cream from your coffee. Entropy, therefore, provides us with an arrow of time: forward is the direction of increasing entropy.  The four laws of thermodynamics  The fundamental principles of thermodynamics were originally expressed in three laws. Later, scientists figured out that a more fundamental law had been neglected, apparently because it had seemed so obvious that it did not need to be stated explicitly. To form a complete set of rules, scientists decided this most fundamental law needed to be included. The problem, though, was that the first three laws had already been established and were well known by their assigned numbers. When faced with the prospect of renumbering the existing laws, which would cause considerable confusion, or placing the pre-eminent law at the end of the list, which would make no logical sense, British physicist Ralph H. Fowler came up with an alternative that solved the dilemma: he called the new law the ""Zeroth Law,"" according to Saint Anselm College (opens in new tab). Here are all four laws in brief:  The Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics states that if two bodies are in thermal equilibrium with some third body, then they are also in equilibrium with each other. This establishes temperature as a fundamental and measurable property of matter.  The First Law of Thermodynamics states that the total increase in the energy of a system is equal to the increase in thermal energy plus the work done on the system. This states that heat is a form of energy and is therefore subject to the principle of conservation — that is, it can be neither created nor destroyed.  The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that heat energy cannot be transferred from a body at a lower temperature to a body at a higher temperature without the addition of energy. This is why it costs money to run an air conditioner.  The Third Law of Thermodynamics states that the entropy of a perfect crystal — that is, a substance made up of atoms arranged in a perfectly ordered, symmetrical pattern — at absolute zero is zero. As explained above, entropy is sometimes called ""waste energy,"" or the energy that is unable to do work; and since there is no heat energy whatsoever at absolute zero, there can be no waste energy. Entropy is also a measure of the disorder in a system, and while a perfect crystal is by definition perfectly ordered, any positive value of temperature means there is motion within the crystal, which causes disorder. For these reasons, there can be no physical system with lower entropy, so entropy always has a positive value.  The science of thermodynamics has been developed over centuries, and its principles apply to nearly every device ever invented. Its importance in modern technology cannot be overstated.

227,265405875107666891812352990602690452684,"The persistent march of a warming climate is seen across a multitude of continuous, incremental changes. CO2 levels in the atmosphere. Ocean heat content. Global sea level rise. Each creeps up year after year, fuelled by human-caused greenhouse gas emissions.  And while climate records are being routinely broken, the cumulative impact of these changes could also cause fundamental parts of the Earth system to change dramatically and irreversibly.  These “tipping points” are thresholds where a tiny change could push a system into a completely new state.  Imagine a child pushing themselves from the top of a playground slide. There is a point beyond which it is too late for the child to stop themselves sliding down. Pass this threshold and the child continues inevitably towards a different state – at the bottom of the slide rather than the top.  In this article, Carbon Brief explores nine key tipping points across the Earth system, from collapsing ice sheets and thawing permafrost, to shifting monsoons and forest dieback.  Along with this explainer, Carbon Brief has published guest articles from experts in four of the tipping points covered here.  Tipping towers  A glance at the news media on any given week will likely highlight all sorts of climate change impacts. From declining Arctic sea ice and record-breaking heatwaves to melting glaciers and worsening droughts, the increase in global average temperature is being felt around the world.  Broadly, these impacts reflect gradual changes caused by a climate that is steadily warming. Scientists have estimated, for example, that for every tonne of CO2 emitted into the atmosphere, summer sea ice cover in the Arctic shrinks by three square metres.  However, there are parts of the Earth system that have the potential to change abruptly in response to warming. These systems have “tipping points”, explains Prof Tim Lenton, director of the Global Systems Institute at the University of Exeter. He tells Carbon Brief:  “A climate tipping point, or any tipping point in any complex system, is where a small change makes a big difference and changes the state or the fate of a system.”  So, rather than a bit more warming causing slightly hotter heatwaves or more melting of glaciers, it causes a dramatic shift to an entire system.  That extra bit of warming would be, as the saying goes, the straw that breaks the camel’s back. Or, to use a more animal-friendly metaphor, a game of Jenga – where a particular component within the Earth system, such as an ice sheet, circulation pattern or ecosystem, is represented by the tower of blocks.  Animation by Tom Prater for Carbon Brief.  The gradual increase in global temperature sees block after block removed from the tower and placed on top. As time goes on, the tower becomes more and more misshapen and unstable. At some point, the tower can no longer support itself and it tips over.  In the game of Jenga, the tower collapses in a split second. For a component of the Earth system, the shift to one physical state to another may take many decades or centuries. But the feature they have in common is that once the collapse has started, it is virtually impossible to stop.  It is worth noting that a tipping point can be caused by natural fluctuations in the climate as well as by an external forcing, such as global warming. These are called “noise-induced” tipping points and include, for example, periods of abrupt change during the last ice age called “Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) events”.  Natural fluctuations can also be the final nudge for a tipping point pushed to the brink by human-caused climate change, says Prof Mat Collins, joint Met Office chair in climate change at the University of Exeter and coordinating lead author on the “Extremes, Abrupt Changes and Managing Risks” chapter of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) special report on the ocean and cryosphere in a changing climate (“SROCC”). He tells Carbon Brief:  “As you approach the edge of the cliff, a small random gust of wind is more likely to blow you over the edge. This is more prevalent in biological systems. A strong marine heatwave in one year can wipe out a large coral ecosystem for many decades – or, perhaps, even permanently. The heatwave is a result of natural fluctuations, but becomes more likely and more extreme with an increasing average trend.”  Back to top  Irreversible change?  The theory of potentially abrupt changes in the Earth system is not new. In a Nature commentary in 1987, for example, Prof Wally Broecker of Columbia University – who died in 2019 – warned that palaeoclimate data suggests the “Earth’s climate does not respond to forcing in a smooth and gradual way. Rather, it responds in sharp jumps which involve large-scale reorganisation of Earth’s system”.  The term “tipping point” itself was popularised by journalist and author Malcolm Gladwell in his book of the same name, published in 2000. Gladwell describes tipping points as “the moment of critical mass, the threshold, the boiling point”, and explores examples throughout human society:  “There was a tipping point for [declining] violent crime in New York in the early 1990s, and a tipping point for the reemergence of Hush Puppies, just as there is a tipping point for the introduction of any new technology.”  In the years since, the term has been used increasingly in scientific circles. However, this has not been without controversy. There are, for example, many different views on how the term should be defined and used, explains Collins:  “There has been an intensive debate in the field of tipping points, abrupt change and irreversibility about the definitions of these terms. They range from the very mathematical to those which are intended to be understood by policymakers.”  According to a 2009 paper on the use of the term “tipping points” in climate science and the media, a presentation (pdf) in 2005 by Dr James Hansen of Columbia University’s Earth Institute helped “initiate a tipping point trend in climate change communication that was quickly reflected in public debate”.  In Hansen’s talk – a tribute to scientist Prof Charles Keeling, given at the American Geophysical Union (AGU) Fall Meeting – Hansen warned that “we are on the precipice of climate system tipping points beyond which there is no redemption”.  By its Fall Meeting of 2008, the AGU had an entire half-day session dedicated to climate tipping points. A Science briefing about the meeting declared that “tipping points, once considered too alarmist for proper scientific circles, have entered the climate change mainstream”.  A year earlier, the IPCC had published its fourth assessment report (“AR4”, pdf). This was the first of its assessment reports to use the term “tipping point” – though the third assessment report (“TAR”, pdf) in 2001 had discussed “large-scale discontinuities” that have the “potential to trigger large-scale changes in Earth systems”. Indeed, speaking to a journalist at the time, chapter lead author Prof Hans Joachim Schellnhuber explained that “these are, more or less, tipping points”.  AR4 adopted a definition of a tipping point based on a 2002 report led by Penn State scientist Prof Richard Alley for the US National Research Council. It states:  “Technically, an abrupt climate change occurs when the climate system is forced to cross some threshold, triggering a transition to a new state at a rate determined by the climate system itself and faster than the cause.”  The IPCC’s definition in its fifth assessment report (“AR5”, pdf), published in 2013-14, gives more detail:  “We define abrupt climate change as a large-scale change in the climate system that takes place over a few decades or less, persists (or is anticipated to persist) for at least a few decades, and causes substantial disruptions in human and natural systems.”  Typically, definitions for a tipping point fall into two categories, says Dr Ricarda Winkelmann, junior professor of climate system analysis at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK). She explains to Carbon Brief:  “One is simply that one vital part of the climate system shows some kind of threshold behaviour and that means that a small perturbation around that element can cause a huge qualitative change. And then there’s another definition that actually says there needs to be a positive feedback mechanism associated with the element. So that means there is something that’s self-reinforcing and then that could lead to irreversible changes as well.”  Passing an irreversible tipping point would mean a system would not revert to its original state even if the forcing lessens or reverses, explains Dr Richard Wood, who leads the Climate, Cryosphere and Oceans group in the Met Office Hadley Centre. He tells Carbon Brief:  “In some cases, there is evidence that once the system has jumped to a different state, then if you remove the climate forcing, the climate system doesn’t just jump back to the original state – it stays in its changed state for some considerable time, or possibly even permanently.”  This is known as “hysteresis”. It occurs when a system undergoes a “bifurcation” – which means to divide or fork into two branches – and it is subsequently difficult, if not impossible, for the system to revert to its previous state.  For example, part of the reason that Greenland has an ice sheet today is that it has had that ice sheet for hundreds of thousands of years. If the Greenland ice sheet were to pass a tipping point that led to its disintegration, simply reducing emissions and lowering global temperatures to pre-industrial levels would not bring it back again. It would probably require another ice age to achieve that.  Similarly, returning to the Jenga analogy, the amount of energy required to rebuild the tower once it collapsed is significantly greater than the energy used to tip it over.  The extent to which the tipping points considered in this article are irreversible is just one of the many uncertainties that researchers are still exploring. Nonetheless, each of the nine – explained below – are examples of where seemingly small changes have the collective potential to pack a potent punch.  Back to top  Shutdown of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation  The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is a system of currents in the Atlantic Ocean that brings warm water up to Europe from the tropics and beyond.  The illustration below shows the two main features of the AMOC: the first is the flow of warm, salty water in the upper layers of the ocean northwards from the Gulf of Mexico (red line). This is made up of the “Gulf Stream” to the south and the “North Atlantic Current” further north. The second is the cooling of water in the high latitudes of the Atlantic, which makes the water more dense. This denser water then sinks and returns southwards towards the equator at much deeper depths (blue line).  The AMOC forms part of a wider network of global ocean circulation patterns that transports heat all around the world. It is “driven by deep water formation”, explains Prof Stefan Rahmstorf, professor of physics of the oceans at Potsdam University and co-chair of earth system analysis at PIK. This is “the sinking of dense, therefore heavy, water in the high latitudes of the North Atlantic”, he explains to Carbon Brief.  Climate change affects this process by diluting the salty sea water with freshwater and by warming it up, he says:  “The dilution happens through increased rainfall and also melting of continental ice in the vicinity of mainly the Greenland ice sheet. And that makes the water lighter and, therefore, unable to sink – or at least less able to sink – which, basically, slows down that whole engine of the global overturning circulation.”  Recent research suggests that the AMOC has already weakened by around 15% since the middle of the 20th century. This is in line with projections by climate models, says Dr Richard Wood. However, the question remains at what point a weakening tips over into a complete shutdown, he explains:  “Perhaps a much less likely, but larger cause for concern is whether there’s a threshold beyond which the AMOC becomes unsustainable and at that point – if you pass that threshold – then over some period of time, the AMOC might reduce to zero or even potentially a reversed circulation. And that would have big impacts on the climate of, well, the whole northern hemisphere, but particularly Europe.”  This shutdown could happen because the AMOC is a self-reinforcing system, explains Rahmstorf:  “The circulation itself brings salty water into the high-latitude Atlantic and the salty water increases the density. And so we can say the water is able to sink because it is salty and it is salty because there is this circulation. So it’s like a self-reinforcing system.”  Such a system can only be pushed “up to a limit”, says Rahmstorf, after which the self-reinforcing system actually works to further weaken the circulation. Too much freshwater in the North Atlantic slows the circulation, preventing it from pulling salty water up from the south. Thus, the North Atlantic freshens even more and the circulation weakens further – and so on. It “really is an on-off system”, he adds.  There is still a lot of uncertainty about where exactly this tipping point is, says Rahmstorf. To the extent that “nobody really knows”, he adds:  “But, I would say, most people think that to trigger a real shutdown would require substantial global warming – like 3C or 4C [above pre-industrial levels]. And we could pretty well minimise this risk by limiting the warming to below 2C. So, if we actually take the Paris Agreement seriously, then I would feel relatively relaxed about the risk of a shutdown. But if we continue on the current path and heading for three or more degrees, then this becomes a really serious concern.”  (According to Climate Action Tracker, current global climate policies put the world on track for around 3C of warming.)  And it is “important to emphasise that climate models are not suggesting a complete shutdown of the AMOC in the next 100 years or so”, adds Wood: “We’re looking at what we call a ‘low-probability, high-impact’ event”.  The IPCC’s special report on 1.5C of warming, for example, concludes that while “it is very likely that the AMOC will weaken over the 21st century”, there is “no evidence indicating significantly different amplitudes of AMOC weakening for 1.5C versus 2C of global warming, or of a shutdown of the AMOC at these global temperature thresholds”.  Were the AMOC to cross a tipping point, models suggest it would trigger a “quick decline that takes decades and then a kind of slower decline which might take even hundreds of years”, says Wood.  This would be “practically irreversible” on human timescales, notes Rahmstorf:  “Depending on the exact nature of the stability of the circulation, it could be shutdown basically indefinitely for thousands of years into a new stable shutdown state. Or it could eventually recover – both things we observe in different models. But, on a timescale if you’re just interested in what happens in the next 200-300 years or so, that doesn’t actually make a difference because it does stay off then once it dies for quite a long time.”  This “shutdown” state is an example of hysteresis, explains Wood in the video below. It means that once you go over the tipping point, even if global warming is stopped or reversed, the AMOC does not necessarily switch back on again immediately.  As the AMOC plays a crucial role in bringing heat up from the tropics, a shutdown would cause “widespread cooling around the whole of the northern hemisphere, but particularly around western Europe and the east coast of North America”, says Wood. This could be in the order of “several degrees, possibly 5C”, he adds.  This cooling would have knock-on impacts for rainfall patterns as there would be less evaporation from the North Atlantic, says Wood. This could either offset or magnify the changes caused by global warming, he says:  “In northern parts of Europe, we might expect from global warming to see wetter winters and then the drying would compensate. In other regions, more in southern Europe, where we would already be expected to see a drying signal from the global-warming signal, so paradoxically, the cooling would give you a further drying. So it would actually reinforce the climate-change signal.”  The knock-on impacts would be considerable. For example, a recent study in the new journal Nature Food suggests that an AMOC shutdown would cause “widespread cessation of arable farming” in the island of Great Britain with “losses of agricultural output that are an order of magnitude larger than the impacts of climate change without an AMOC collapse”.  In addition, there will be implications for the ocean itself, notes Rahmstorf:  “The whole North Atlantic ecosystem is adapted to the existence of this overturning circulation, which really sets the conditions – the seasonal cycle, the temperature, the nutrient conditions – in the North Atlantic, and so the intricate web of the Atlantic ecosystem will be substantially disrupted if allow such a massive change in the ocean circulation to happen.”  Finally, research suggests that the collapse of the AMOC could itself trigger other tipping points. As the SROCC explains:  “For example, a collapse of the AMOC may induce causal interactions like changes in ENSO [El Niño–Southern Oscillation] characteristics, dieback of the Amazon rainforest and shrinking of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet due to seesaw effect, ITCZ [Intertropical Convergence Zone] southern migration and large warming of the Southern Ocean.”  However, the SROCC notes that “such a worst-case scenario remains very poorly constrained” as a result of the large uncertainties around how systems such as AMOC will respond to warming.  Back to top  West Antarctic ice sheet disintegration  The West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) is one of three regions making up Antarctica. The other two are East Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula, with the Transantarctic Mountain range dividing east from west.  Although much smaller than its neighbour to the east, the WAIS still holds enough ice to raise global sea levels by around 3.3 metres. Therefore, even a partial loss of its ice would be enough to change coastlines around the world dramatically.  Aerial view over Pine Island Bay, West Antarctica. Credit: Universal Images Group North America LLC / Alamy Stock Photo.  The long-term stability of the WAIS is of particular concern because it is a “marine-based” ice sheet. As the IPCC’s special report on the ocean and cryosphere in a changing climate (“SROCC”) explains, this means that it sits “upon bedrock that largely lies below sea level and [is] in contact with ocean heat, making [it] vulnerable to rapid and irreversible ice loss”.  The map below shows the elevation of Antarctic bedrock; the greens, yellows and reds indicate areas above sea level, while the whites and blues show areas below it – by as much as 2.5km. The WAIS itself is more than 4km thick in places.  Acting under the force of gravity, the ice of the WAIS gradually flows out from its interior towards the coast and into the Southern Ocean. Fresh snowfall on the interior of the ice sheet replenishes the lost ice. If the ice sheet loses more ice to the ocean than it gains in snow, it adds to global sea levels.  For example, analysis published in Nature in 2018 showed that the rate of ice loss from the WAIS had tripled from 53bn tonnes a year during 1992-97 to 159bn tonnes a year in 2012-2017.  Where the ice meets the ocean, floating ice shelves form. These ice shelves have a “buttressing” effect, holding back the glaciers on land that flow into them.  Sitting on the ocean surface, ice shelves are at risk of melting from above and below from warm air and water, respectively. In the Antarctic Peninsula, for example, research has shown that the collapse of the Larsen B ice shelf in 2002 was primarily driven by warm air temperatures. While the Larsen C ice shelf, which is “thinning rapidly”, is being melted from above and below.  Because ice shelves float on water, their collapse does not directly cause sea level rise. But thinning and/or collapse of the WAIS’s ice shelves could trigger a positive feedback loop that sees rapid and irreversible loss of land ice into the ocean – which would add to sea levels. This theory is called “marine ice sheet instability” (MISI).  The illustration below shows how it works. As an ice shelf thins, more ice lifts off the seafloor and begins to float. This pushes back (see blue arrows) the “grounding line” – the transition point between grounded and floating ice (indicated by dashed lines). Floating ice flows more rapidly than grounded ice and so the rate of ice flow near the grounding line increases (black arrows). Faster flow means thinning, which may in turn cause more ice to lift off and float. And because greater thickness also causes the ice to flow faster, grounding-line retreat into deeper sections of the ice sheet can also produce faster flow.  What makes this a positive feedback loop is the retrograde slope of the WAIS’s bedrock. Not only is much of the bedrock beneath the ice sheet below sea level, large portions of it slope downwards away from the coast. This means that once ice sheet retreat reaches this point, it is self-sustaining.  (There is also an additional feedback loop mechanism that could further endanger the WAIS. This is called Marine Ice Cliff Instability (MICI), which would see towering cliffs of glacier ice collapse into the ocean under their own weight. The theory is still under debate.)  In terms of tipping-point behaviour, most research has focused on the Amundsen Sea sector of the WAIS into which six glaciers drain. As far back at the 1980s, this region was identified as the “weak underbelly” of the WAIS. Here, the grounded ice flows directly into the ocean with “no significant ice shelf barrier” to hold it back.  Antarctica’s contribution to global sea levels is currently dominated by ice loss from Amundsen sea sector glaciers. Sections of the Thwaites and Pine Island glaciers, for example, are thinning at rates of 49 and 45cm per year, respectively, on average over 1992-2017.  1,000 km Antarctic peninsula Ronne ice shelf East Antarctic Ice Sheet Pine Island glacier South pole West Antarctic Ice Sheet Transantarctic mountains Amudsen sea Thwaites glacier Ross ice shelf Graphic: Carbon Brief. Credit: Quantarctica/Norwegian Polar Institute.  Research indicates that glaciers in this sector are “undergoing a marine ice sheet instability that will significantly contribute to sea level rise in decades to centuries to come”.  For example, model simulations in a 2014 study in Science have suggested that the “process of marine ice-sheet destabilisation is already under way on Thwaites Glacier”. The study notes:  “Although [ice] losses are likely to be relatively modest over the next century (<0.25 mm/year of sea level equivalent, SLE), rapid collapse (>1 mm/year of SLE) will ensue once the grounding line reaches the basin’s deeper regions, which could occur within centuries.”  This rapid collapse “would probably spill over to adjacent catchments, undermining much of West Antarctica”, the study adds.  The SROCC is also a little more circumspect in its conclusions. It says that rapid mass loss due to glacier flow acceleration in this region “may indicate the beginning of MISI”. However, it also notes that “observational data are not yet sufficient to determine whether these changes mark the beginning of irreversible retreat”.  Prof Tim Lenton tells Carbon Brief that whether all or part of the WAIS has already passed a tipping point for irreversible loss is “the big concern at the moment” because of the sea level rise it would cause.  Overall, the SROCC assessment of “partial West-Antarctic Ice sheet collapse” is that it is potentially abrupt and would be “irreversible for decades to millennia”. It ascribes “low confidence” to a collapse during the 21st century.  A Nature Climate Change review paper published in 2018 concluded that “under sustained warming, a key threshold for survival of Antarctic ice shelves, and thus the stability of the ice sheet, seems to lie between 1.5 and 2C mean annual air temperature above present”.  This temperature threshold refers to regional warming in Antarctica, rather than a global average figure. However – as lead author Prof Frank Pattyn explains to Carbon Brief – because the poles warm more quickly than the global average, 2C of warming on Antarctica from present is approximately equivalent to 2C of global warming since pre-industrial levels.  Pattyn, a glaciologist and co-director of the Laboratoire de Glaciologie at the Université libre de Bruxelles, also notes that a tipping point for the WAIS “is not sharply defined”. Referring to the different “Representative Concentration Pathway” emissions scenarios, he adds:  “Studies show that under RCP2.6 the ice sheets continue to lose mass but seem stable, while for RCP4.5, in some cases irreversible mass loss is encountered. However, only a few studies consider the full range of RCPs and most of them only compare RCP2.6 to RCP8.5.”  Glossary RCP2.6: The RCPs (Representative Concentration Pathways) are scenarios of future concentrations of greenhouse gases and other forcings. RCP2.6 (also sometimes referred to as “RCP3-PD”) is a “peak and decline” scenario where stringent mitigation and carbon dioxide removal technologies mean atmospheric CO2 concentration peaks and then falls during this century. By 2100, CO2 levels increase to around 420ppm – around 20ppm above current levels – equivalent to 475ppm once other forcings are included (in CO2e). By 2100, global temperatures are likely to rise by 1.3-1.9C above pre-industrial levels.

RCP4.5 is a “stabilisation scenario” where policies are put in place so atmospheric CO2 concentration levels off around the middle of the century, though temperatures do not stabilise before 2100. These policies include a shift to low-carbon energy technologies and the deployment of carbon capture and storage. In RCP4.5, atmospheric CO2 sits at 540ppm by 2100 – roughly 140ppm higher than now – equivalent to 630ppm once other forcings are included (in CO2e).

RCP8.5 is a “ very high baseline ” emission scenario brought about by rapid population growth, high energy demand, fossil fuel dominance and an absence of climate change policies. This scenario is the highest of the RCPs and sees atmospheric CO2 rise to around 935ppm by 2100, equivalent to 1,370ppm once other forcings are included (in CO2e). The likely range of global temperatures by 2100 for RCP8.5 is 4.0-6.1C above pre-industrial levels.

For example, a Nature Geoscience review paper from 2011 notes:  “The palaeo record strongly suggests that the WAIS largely disappeared, perhaps during the past few hundred thousand years and more confidently during the past few million years, in response to warming similar to or less than that projected under business-as-usual CO2 emission scenarios for the next few centuries.”  Back to top  Amazon rainforest dieback  The Amazon rainforest is the largest rainforest in the world. Spanning nine countries in South America, it is twice the size of India. The lush vegetation is a haven for millions of species of plants, insects, birds and animals.  As its name suggests, a rainforest is sustained by very wet conditions. But the forest itself plays a critical role in the local climate. As the forest is saturated with heavy rains, much of this moisture is returned to the atmosphere through evaporation. In addition, transpiration of moisture from plant leaves transfers water from the soil into the atmosphere. These two processes combined are called “evapotranspiration”.  These processes keep the atmosphere moist, but also help drive convection – strong upward motion of the air – which, ultimately, creates clouds and more rainfall. Research published in the 1970s showed that the Amazon generates around half of its own rainfall.  The result is that either reducing the amount of rainfall or the amount of forest can shift the climate into a drier state that cannot support a rainforest. There are three potential causes of this, explains Prof Richard Betts, head of climate impacts at the Met Office Hadley Centre and chair of climate impacts at the University of Exeter.  The first is a decline in rainfall in response to a warming climate. Model projections suggest this would be a result of “particular patterns of sea surface temperature (SST) change in the tropical Atlantic and Pacific”, says Betts, but there is a lot of variation between models as to how strong the impact would be on the Amazon. The second is a response to reduced transpiration in response to higher CO2, Betts says:  “Microscopic pores in plant leaves open less widely under higher CO2. So the plants lose less water and less transpiration means less water going back into the atmosphere.”  Finally, the third cause would be the direct impact of deforestation – fewer trees mean less evapotranspiration and less moisture entering the atmosphere.  There is only so much drying the Amazon could tolerate before the rainforest would no longer be able to support itself. Beyond this point, the forest would see widespread “dieback” and transition to savannah – a drier ecosystem dominated by open grasslands with few trees.  In the clip below, Betts summarises how the Amazon could be pushed “beyond the point of no return”.  Dr David Lapola – a research scientist at the University of Campinas in Brazil – cautions that, while it is “reasonable to think that deforestation and fire could of course contribute to reach that [Amazon dieback] tipping point”, the hypothesis is predominantly based on model simulations. He tells Carbon Brief:  “It happens that the same model simulations show that if the so-called ‘CO2 fertilisation effect’ – as a basic input to photosynthesis, when atmospheric CO2 increases it theoretically enhances plant productivity – really exists and expresses itself in the Amazon, then it would counteract the bad effects of higher temperature and lower rainfall, leaving the forest basically the way it is now. The problem is that we don’t have experimental evidence proving the existence, magnitude and duration of such CO2 fertilisation effect in the tropics.”  If there is indeed a threshold, where might it lie? Betts says that “3C is the lowest level of warming that might trigger it, but it might need much higher warming”.  A Science Advances editorial last year by Prof Carlos Nobre of the University of Saõ Paulo’s Institute for Advanced Studies and Prof Thomas Lovejoy of George Mason University noted that “many studies show that in the absence of other contributing factors, 4C of global warming would be the tipping point to degraded savannahs in most of the central, southern and eastern Amazon”.  One of those contributing factors is deforestation, which could hasten a shift to savannah as a “fragmented forest is probably more sensitive to rainfall reductions driven by global heating”, says Betts.  In a recent interview with Yale Environment 360, Nobre explains that he “published a paper about this in Science in 1990 that said if we deforest parts of the Amazon, it will become a savannah”. He adds:  “The post-deforestation climate will no longer be a very wet climate like the Amazon. It will become drier, it will have a much longer dry season, like the long dry seasons in the savannahs in the tropics in Africa, South America and Asia.”  Without global warming, a tipping point for Amazon dieback could be reached “if you exceed 40% total deforested area in the Amazon”, says Nobre:  “About 60 to 70% of the Amazon forest would turn into a dry savannah, especially in the southern and northern Amazon, areas that now border savannahs. Only the western Amazon near the Andes, which is very rainy, the forest will still be there.”  Nobre estimates that approximately 17% of the Amazon rainforest has been cleared so far – principally for cattle ranching and soy plantations. While rates of deforestation slowed in the early 21st century, they have recently rebounded. In the Brazilian Amazon, for example, tree clearance fell by two-thirds between 2005 and 2011, but 2018 saw annual rates rise to their highest levels in a decade. In 2019, deforestation rose again – with rates 85% higher than in 2018.  Reports suggest that a change in policy under Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro is encouraging development at the expense of the rainforest.  Factoring in climate change and “widespread use of fire” brings the tipping point closer, say Lovejoy and Nobre in their editorial. They estimate that a “tipping point for the Amazon system to flip to non-forest ecosystems in eastern, southern and central Amazonia [lies] at 20-25% deforestation”. Nobre recently told the Guardian that this could happen “in 15 to 20 years”.  There is “no point in discovering the precise tipping point by tipping it”, their editorial says, but instead to “build back a margin of safety…by reducing the deforested area to less than 20%”.  New research published in Nature Communications suggests that, once tipped, the Amazon rainforest could shift to savannah within around 50 years. This finding, which is based on an empirical model, is “broadly in line with the multidecadal shift durations projected by expert judgement and process-based models”, the authors say.  The impacts of losing the Amazon rainforest would be felt locally and globally. As well as being an ecological “catastrophe” for wildlife, the socioeconomic damage to the region could amount to $0.9-3.6tn over a 30-year period.  “The reduced evaporation and reduced convection would alter atmospheric circulation worldwide,” says Betts, which would influence weather patterns around the world.  Amazon dieback would also make it more difficult to tackle climate change, he notes:  “Increased release of CO2 from forest fires and tree death would accelerate CO2 rise, and with the forest gone we would also have lost an important carbon sink which would mean that deeper emissions cuts would be needed to stop the rise in atmospheric CO2.”  Unpublished results from a new study by Nobre, seen by BBC’s Newsnight programme, suggest that the south-eastern part of the forest – around 20% of the Amazon basin – has become a net source of CO2.  The results of a study seen by Newsnight suggest that a significant part of the Amazon may already have reached tipping point – when the forest loses the ability to renew itself and begins to emit more CO2 than it absorbs.    READ: https://t.co/n5axU2G7p1#Newsnight | @ggatehouse pic.twitter.com/aI4PENnpe0 — BBC Newsnight (@BBCNewsnight) February 11, 2020  There are already “ominous signals” of changes in the Amazon, say Lovejoy and Nobre in another Science Advances editorial published in December 2019:  “Dry seasons in Amazonian regions are already hotter and longer. Mortality rates of wet climate species are increased, whereas dry climate species are showing resilience. The increasing frequency of unprecedented droughts in 2005, 2010 and 2015/16 is signaling that the tipping point is at hand.”  Lapola agrees that “we may be already observing” a shift in the Amazon system. He explains:  “First evidence: a study has shown that the dry season is already getting longer – by a few days in the last decade – in south Amazonia (Mato Grosso and Rondonia). Second evidence: a recent study showed that forest composition is already changing towards tree species that are more resistant to drought. This suggests that the dieback may be more subtle than previously thought, but not less catastrophic.”  The IPCC’s fifth assessment report (“AR5”, pdf) describes dieback of tropical forests as “potentially abrupt”, but “reversible within centuries”. Whereas in a recent Nature “world view” piece, Nobre writes that a recovery from an Amazon tipping point would be “probably impossible”.  Whether a reversal would be achievable, at the very least it would be slow, adds Betts:  “Reforestation or natural regrowth in places with less severe drying could help increase rainfall levels again. Loss of forests on passing the tipping would be quicker though – forest loss can be quite rapid through fire and tree death, but return is slower because it is limited by how fast new trees grow.”  Back to top  West African monsoon shift  The term “monsoon” in its strictest sense refers to the seasonal reversal of winds and its accompanying rainfall. Along with India, West Africa is one of the few places on Earth where this happens.  The West African monsoon (WAM) brings rainfall to West Africa and the Sahel – a band of semi-arid grassland sandwiched between the Sahara desert to the north and tropical rainforests to the south. The Sahel stretches from the Atlantic coast of Mauritania and Senegal through to Sudan, Eritrea and the Red Sea.

West Africa’s dry season, which runs from November through to May, sees prevailing winds “come from the desert, so they’re dry, dusty winds”, says Dr Alessandra Giannini, a senior research scientist at Columbia University (currently at the Laboratoire de Météorologie Dynamique in Paris as part of a “Make Our Planet Great Again” grant). The shift to the wet season sees this system switch, she explains to Carbon Brief:  “When the system reverses, the low pressure over the Sahara – or the land [more generally] – drives winds from the southwest inland and those are moist winds because they’re from the ocean.”  The moisture that the winds bring to the region is part of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), a huge belt of low pressure that encircles the Earth near the equator. Ultimately, the monsoon is being driven by insolation, says Giannini, as the ITCZ wanders north and south across the tropics each year, roughly tracking the position of the sun through the seasons.  (Giannini emphasises that, while the ITCZ and monsoon are “part of the same season and the same latitudinal migration of the rain band”, some researchers prefer to “distinguish between the ITCZ over the ocean from the monsoon inland” and so do not use the terms interchangeably.)  The Sahel marks the ITCZ’s most northerly position and the monsoon brings rain to the region from around June to September.  But the West African monsoon is notoriously unreliable. Between the late 1960s and 1980s, a lack of rain hit much of the Sahel, with average rainfall declining by more than 30% over most of the region compared to the 1950s. This plunged the region into an extended drought, contributing to a famine that killed tens of thousands of people and triggering an international aid effort.

Credit: Joint Institute for the Study of the Atmosphere and Ocean at the University of Washington  It was Giannini’s 2003 Science paper that identified that the cause of the drought primarily lay in warm SSTs around Africa, not desertification caused by farmers and an expanding population. (Earlier work had shown the connection between SSTs and Sahel rainfall variability more generally.)  The warm ocean temperatures reduced the temperature contrast between the continent in the hot summer and the cooler surrounding waters. This saw the monsoon rains shift southwards away from the Sahel, causing drought. The effect was reinforced by the “climate-vegetation feedback”, where drier conditions saw less vegetation growth, a reduction in evapotranspiration and even less rainfall.  Subsequent research by Giannini has shown the combination of warming of the tropical oceans (in response to rising greenhouse gases) and cooling in the North Atlantic (as a result of air pollution from northern hemisphere countries) led to drying of the Sahel.  Rainfall in the Sahel has since shown a partial recovery. This is due, in part, to a warming climate and a reduction in air pollution rates. These changes show that the WAM is a “very sensitive system”, says Giannini and the Sahel is most at risk because it is at the edge of the monsoon.  The past also hints that a tipping point “is in the [WAM] system”, says Giannini:  “So the past shift – the abruptness of the onset of drought in the late 60s-early 70s – is an indication that the system is sensitive and so it could happen again.”  Theory suggests that a warming climate could actually bring more rainfall to the Sahel. As land heats up faster than the water, rising global temperatures could strengthen the land-sea contrast that helps drive the WAM northwards each year. This could bring more rain to the Sahel and, perhaps, see vegetation return to some southern parts of the Sahara.  There is evidence of similar changes in Earth’s distant past. During the African Humid Period (AHP) around 11,000 to 5,000 years ago, natural oscillations in the Earth’s orbit around the sun – assisted by various feedback mechanisms – saw the WAM strengthen, bringing greater rainfall into North Africa. Evidence from palaeoclimate data – such as lake sediments – suggest the region was widely covered with vegetation and deep freshwater lakes during this time, resulting in a “Green Sahara”.  Research has suggested that the “onset and termination of this humid period were very abrupt, occurring within decades to centuries”, although this is still debated.  But the AHP is some distance from being an analogue for the modern day. The changes were being driven primarily by the sun, not large increases in greenhouse gases. Therefore, it provides limited insight into how the WAM will be affected by climate change.  Prof Martin Claussen, professor of meteorology at the University of Hamburg and director at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology tells Carbon Brief that even in model projections under “strong warming”, the “response of the Sahara is much weaker than it was in response to the change in insolation several thousand years ago”. So, rather than a Green Sahara, projections suggest a “shift of the Sahel zone to the north”, he says.  The response to recent warming has actually been more variability in the WAM, Giannini says:  “In some ways, we are seeing the wetting already, but it’s a wetting that is different also from the past in that it seems to be made up of more extreme events – so more extreme rains and maybe longer periods of dry spells interspersed.”  And, more generally, projections from different climate models have suggested both drier and wetter futures for the Sahel under a changing climate – with the latter linked to a tipping point of 3C of localised warming in the Gulf of Guinea.  Research has also indicated a mix of impacts. A 2018 study using a high-resolution climate model, for example, simulated “decreasing precipitation over the southern Sahel and increase of precipitation over the western Sahara” by the end of the century under the very high emissions RCP8.5 scenario.  As a result, the IPCC’s special report on 1.5C concludes that there is “low confidence” in projections of a “strengthening of monsoon and wetting and greening of Sahel and Sahara”. It also notes that while there are “uncertain changes” associated with a 1.5C or 2C warmer world, it is “unlikely” that a tipping point would be reached that these temperature levels.  Even if a 3C temperature rise did bring significantly more beneficial rainfall to the region, the IPCC says “it should be noted that there would be significant offsets in the form of strong regional warming and related adverse impacts on crop yield, livestock mortality and human health under such low mitigation futures”.  Finally, research has also suggested that the WAM could be affected by another tipping point – a significant slowdown of the AMOC. The evidence for this mainly comes from palaeoclimate data from the end of the last ice age, says Prof John Chiang, who runs a climate dynamics research group at the University of California, Berkeley. “In particular for the Younger Dryas event when the AMOC was thought to slow down dramatically because of the influx of freshwater into the North Atlantic,” he tells Carbon Brief. “West African monsoon rainfall weakened during this period.”  Why AMOC slowdown, which occurs in the high latitude North Atlantic, leads to WAM weakening is “still an open question”, says Chiang:  “There are two schools of thought. One is that colder conditions in the high-latitude North Atlantic can be transmitted via the atmosphere to the WAM, mainly through the cold conditions permeating into North Africa and affecting the monsoon…The other is that ocean circulation changes resulting from the AMOC slowdown ‘rewires’ the currents around the tropical Atlantic, leading to a warmer South tropical Atlantic and thus causing a weakening of the WAM.”  So, another potential mechanism complicates the future for the WAM even more, says Chiang:  “The question is which influence will win out for West Africa in the future – the direct influence of warming, which wettens, or the AMOC influence, that dries West Africa.”  Back to top  Permafrost and methane hydrates  Permafrost is the name given to ground – soil or rock – that contains ice or frozen organic material that has remained at or below 0C for at least two years. It covers around a quarter of the non-glaciated land in the northern hemisphere – including large swaths of Siberia, Alaska, northern Canada and the Tibetan plateau – and can be as much as a kilometre thick. In the southern hemisphere, permafrost is found in parts of Patagonia, Antarctica and New Zealand’s Southern Alps. Submarine permafrost also occurs in shallow parts of the Arctic and Southern oceans.  This frozen ground holds a vast amount of carbon, accumulated from dead plants and animals over thousands of years. There is around twice as much carbon in permafrost than is currently in the Earth’s atmosphere.  As the climate warms, there is an increasing risk that that permafrost will thaw. This brings microbes in the soil out of hibernation, allowing them to break down the organic carbon in the soil. This process releases CO2 and – to a lesser extent – methane. Thus, large-scale thawing of permafrost has the potential to cause further climate warming.  Permafrost thaw in Svalbard, Norway. Credit: blickwinkel / Alamy Stock Photo.  There is already evidence of permafrost warming. The IPCC’s special report on the ocean and cryosphere in a changing climate (“SROCC”), for example, says that there is “very high confidence” that record high temperatures at ~10–20m depth in permafrost have been “documented at many long-term monitoring sites in the northern hemisphere circumpolar permafrost region”. In some places, these temperatures are 2-3C higher than 30 years ago.  Meanwhile, the 2019 Arctic Report Card from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) concluded that thawing permafrost across the Arctic “could be releasing an estimated 300-600m tonnes of net carbon per year to the atmosphere”.  The lead of author of the permafrost chapter, Prof Ted Schuur of Northern Arizona University, told the Washington Post that recent research indicates “we’ve turned this corner for Arctic carbon”. He said:  “These observations signify that the feedback to accelerating climate change may already be underway.”  The SROCC says there is “high confidence” in projections of “widespread disappearance of Arctic near-surface permafrost…this century as a result of warming, with important consequences for global climate”. It notes:  “By 2100, near surface permafrost area will decrease by 2-66% for RCP2.6 and 30-99% for RCP8.5. This is projected to release 10s to 100s of billions of tonnes [or gigatonnes, GtC], up to as much as 240 GtC, of permafrost carbon as CO2 and methane to the atmosphere with the potential to accelerate climate change.”  The report also warns (pdf) that degradation of permafrost thaw is “expected to be irreversible on timescales relevant to human societies and ecosystems”. It also notes:  “Ice melt or the thawing of permafrost involve thresholds (state changes) that allow for abrupt, nonlinear responses to ongoing climate warming.”  For example, explains Dr David Armstrong McKay – a postdoctoral researcher at the Stockholm Resilience Centre, focusing on modelling nonlinear biosphere-climate feedbacks – some areas of decomposition may release so much warmth that it triggers a so-called “compost bomb”. This is where the “internal heat generation becomes the main driving force for further thaw and carbon release”, he explains to Carbon Brief, “even if global warming stopped”.  This effect could have its own tipping point, he adds:  “In one study, a tipping point for this internal heat production occurred by the time local mean [absolute] annual air temperature reached around 1.2C, which is when organic decomposition became significant in their model. However, this process depends on how wet, insulated and organic-rich the soil is – all major sources of uncertainty – and will be localised rather than across the whole permafrost simultaneously.”  Similarly, rapid permafrost thaw can also be triggered – and enhanced – by disturbances such as fire, abrupt drying events, soil subsidence and erosion resulting from ice-rich permafrost thaw (known as “thermokarst”). While “there’s no known large-scale tipping point for slumping”, says Armstrong McKay, research has “suggested that it could double our current permafrost emission estimates”.  Overall, the evidence indicates that there are several mechanisms for abrupt regional thawing, says Armstrong McKay, while for permafrost thaw more generally, it is expected that it “will act as more of a continuous positive feedback on climate change rather than an abrupt tipping point”. However, some studies suggest a more widespread tipping point could occur beyond 5C, he adds.  Dr Andy Wiltshire, terrestrial carbon cycle manager at the Met Office Hadley Centre, agrees. At the COP25 climate talks in Madrid, he told Carbon Brief:  “Tipping points relate to the fact that you have a change and then that change almost drives itself, so it means you go from one state into another. Now, we don’t tend to see that kind of behaviour in permafrost – at least in the large scale. So what we’re seeing with permafrost in the kind of modelling we’re doing is there’s been more of a gradual response.”  Permafrost thaw is, however, irreversible, Wiltshire notes. The carbon contained in the soils has built up over “incredibly long periods of time”. Once it is lost to the atmosphere, there is no getting it back. He explained:  “If we stop warming, then we should see the emissions from permafrost stop, but in terms of that carbon going back into permafrost, pragmatically that’s not possible.”  Related to permafrost are methane hydrates, or “clathrates”. This is an ice-like substance formed when methane and water combine at low temperatures and moderate pressure. It is almost exclusively found under the seafloor on continental shelves – areas of seabed immediately surrounding a land mass, where the sea is relatively shallow compared to the open ocean beyond it.  Methane hydrates have been central to claims in recent years of a potential “methane bomb” in the Arctic. The theory suggests that ocean warming could melt these ice crystals, releasing vast amounts of methane into the atmosphere.  A few years ago, for example, scientists identified “widespread seepage of methane from seafloor sediments offshore Svalbard”, which they said “may, in part, be driven by hydrate destabilisation” due to ocean warming. Research also suggested that there were “ready to release” deposits of hydrates in the East Siberian Arctic Shelf (ESAS) under the Arctic Ocean – containing as much as 1,400bn tonnes of carbon. The size of this estimate has been questioned by other scientists.  (For comparison, global emissions from fossil fuels and industry in 2019 amounted to around 10bn tonnes of carbon.)

A review paper in 2016, for example, concluded that there was “no conclusive proof that hydrate-derived methane is reaching the atmosphere now”. Methane released at the seafloor “only rarely survives the trip through the water column to reach the atmosphere”, notes a Nature Education Knowledge, because it is oxidised by bacteria in the water.  Indeed, any bubbles of methane coming from the seafloor are more likely to be coming from permafrost than hydrates, adds Armstrong McKay:  “It has been suggested that methane bubble plumes detected in shallow Arctic seas are from destabilising methane hydrates, but most scientists believe that most of this methane is actually from submerged permafrost which has been gradually decaying since the last glacial maximum, but may be gradually accelerating now.”  In addition, while permafrost soils are in direct contact with a warming atmosphere, methane hydrates occur in sediments at great depths below the seafloor. As a result, research indicates that it will “barely be affected by warming over even 10,000 years”.  Overall, “this makes permafrost thawing the bigger concern to us now”, concludes Armstrong McKay, “with most methane hydrates likely to remain relatively stable over the next few centuries”.  Back to top  Coral reef die-off  Coral reefs are often cited as one of the ecological systems most sensitive to global warming. As a paper published in Science in 2007 puts it:  “Atmospheric CO2 concentration is expected to exceed 500 parts per million (ppm) and global temperatures to rise by at least 2C by 2050 to 2100, values that significantly exceed those of at least the past 420,000 years during which most extant [i.e. existing] marine organisms evolved.”  Recent years have seen a series of “mass bleaching” events in warm water corals, caused primarily by prolonged exposure to high sea temperatures. Under continued heat stress, corals expel the tiny colourful algae living in their tissues – known as zooxanthellae – leaving behind a white skeleton.  The algae provide the corals with energy through photosynthesis. Without them, the corals can slowly starve. Although corals can reacquire their zooxanthellae if conditions turn more favourable, persistent thermal stress can kill off the coral communities of entire reefs.  Coral bleaching in the northern Great Barrier Reef, Queensland, Australia, March 2017. Credit: Nature Picture Library / Alamy Stock Photo.  Mass coral-reef bleaching events have become five times more common worldwide over the past 40 years. The first global mass-bleaching event was recorded in 1998. This has been followed by the second and third in 2010 and 2014-17, respectively. These events were caused by marine heatwaves – extended periods of unusually high temperatures that were themselves boosted by human-caused warming and El Niño.  The map below, from the IPCC’s special report on the ocean and cryosphere in a changing climate (“SROCC”), shows how coral reefs around the world were affected in 2015-16. The shading on the map indicates the annual maximum “degree heating week” (DHW) over 2015 and 2016. (DHW is a measure of cumulative heat stress that “describes how much heat has accumulated in an area over the past 12 weeks by adding up any temperatures that exceed 1C above the maximum summertime mean”.) The dots highlight reefs that experienced severe (purple), moderate (mauve) and no substantial (white) bleaching.  Map shows the Degree Heating Week (DHW) annual maximum over 2015 and 2016. Symbols indicate where severe bleaching affected more than 30% of corals (purple dots), moderate bleaching affected less than 30% of corals (mauve dots) and no substantial bleaching was recorded (white dots). Source: IPCC SROCC ( 2019 ) Fig 6.3  Thermal stress is not the only threat to coral reefs. They are also at risk from other factors, including overfishing, destructive fishing practices, sedimentation associated with sea level rise, runoff of nutrients from the land, storm damage, ocean acidification and shifts in ocean circulation.  This lethal cocktail has already seen “persistent shifts from the original dominance by corals to a preponderance of fleshy seaweed or other weedy assemblages” in coral reefs around the world, says a review paper from 2010.  Fast-growing tropical macroalgae can quickly takeover dead coral skeletons, potentially preventing them from being recolonised by corals and leaving them in an altered, albeit stable, state. These shifts can be rapid, says a 2016 study in Scientific Reports:  “Coral reef ecosystems have been observed to undergo dramatic and sometimes abrupt shifts in community state from one dominated by reef-forming coral to one where other space holders predominate. The alternative space holder often, but not always, is fleshy macroalgae.”  Such transitions “have been observed on tropical reefs worldwide, and particularly in the Caribbean”, the study adds. It is typical of ecosystems to show “threshold, rather than linear, responses to slowly building drivers of change such as fishing pressure, added nutrients and rising global temperatures”, says another review paper.  For example, after the 1998 mass-bleaching event, average coral cover in the Cousin Island marine reserve in the Seychelles declined to less than 1% by 2005, while macroalgae cover increased by as much as 40%.  A 2020 study in Nature Communications suggests that, once tipped, Caribbean coral reefs could collapse within 15 years. Such “decadal timescales” are “coherent with the observations that coral cover across the Caribbean declined by 80% from 1977 to 2001 and may completely disappear by 2035, depending on rates of further overfishing, climate change and ocean acidification”, the authors note.  It is worth noting that heat stress has the same destructive effect on seaweed, such as kelp, in temperate systems, says Dr Maria Beger, an academic fellow in marine conservation science at the University of Leeds. She tells Carbon Brief:  “They then also get replaced by macroalgae and/or corals – this is called ‘tropicalisation’ of higher latitude temperate reefs. What both have in common is that the habitat engineering species are being killed.”  The loss of herbivorous fish from overfishing can be a particular driver of coral reef decline, says Dr Mark Eakin, coordinator of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Coral Reef Watch programme. He tells Carbon Brief:  “While ecologically intact reefs can bounce back from events such as hurricanes or even severe bleaching, when they lack their herbivores they just can’t bounce back.”  A 2007 study explains that herbivores “play an important role in promoting reef resilience and in reef recovery” by removing algae. Thus, they are crucial for a reef returning to a “coral dominated states if disturbance has occurred”.  However, the study also warns that it is “naive to assume that the protection of herbivorous species…will result in the reversal of a phase shift once macroalgae have become established”. This is because “most herbivorous fishes avoid macroalgae”, the authors say.  The key here is to have healthy numbers of herbivores that “can graze the algae and thus prevent their establishment”, Beger adds. It is once the algae are big that they are less likely to be eaten, she tells Carbon Brief:  “What we consider as normal coral reef herbivores mostly eat the filamentous algae that establish first once a coral is dead. Once the algae establish past being tiny, they are less palatable.”  Other factors can also affect how well a reef recovers after bleaching. A 2015 Nature study of the Seychelles after the 1998 bleaching event found that, of 21 reefs studied, 12 recovered and “nine reefs underwent regime shifts to fleshy macroalgae”. It explains:  “Recovery was favoured when reefs were structurally complex and in deeper water, when density of juvenile corals and herbivorous fishes was relatively high and when nutrient loads were low.”  Recovery still depends on there being sufficient time for corals to reestablish themselves. A healthy reef can “bounce back in 10-15 years” after bleaching, says Eakin, with “regrowth of rapidly growing corals”. However, “many reefs have shown little to no recovery after severe mortality events”, he adds:  “In a recent paper, we showed that severe bleaching occurred every 25-30 years in the 1980s. Now it recurs in less than six years. That is far too fast when 10-15 years to start recovery is the best case scenario.”  A review study, published in Science in 2007, concluded that atmospheric concentrations “above 500ppm appears extremely risky for coral reefs and the tens of millions of people who depend on them directly, even under the most optimistic circumstances”. CO2 levels have already surpassed 410ppm and are projected to exceed 500ppm by 2100 in all but the most stringent mitigation scenarios for emissions this century.  In 2016, the first study to compare the widespread impacts of climate change at 1.5C and 2C of warming warned that 90% of tropical reefs would be “at risk of severe degradation due to temperature-induced bleaching from 2050 onwards” in a 1.5C warmer world. For 2C, this risk rose to 98% of reefs, the study says, indicating that the extra 0.5C of warming “is likely to be decisive for the future of tropical coral reefs”.  The study notes:  “Our analysis reiterates earlier findings that the risk of coral reefs to suffer from long-term degradation eventually leading to an ecosystem regime shift will be substantial as early as 2030.”  The researchers even note that their findings are likely to be “rather conservative” because they only consider the impacts of rising CO2 and not other coral reef stressors.  The findings of the IPCC’s special report on 1.5C are only very slightly less bleak. It says:  “Even achieving emissions reduction targets consistent with the ambitious goal of 1.5C of global warming under the Paris Agreement will result in the further loss of 70-90% of reef-building corals compared to today, with 99% of corals being lost under warming of 2C or more.”  As experts in Australia told Carbon Brief last year, some of the more heat-resistant corals may be more resilient than these estimates suggest, but what the remaining reefs “will look like – and what the consequences will be for the other reef inhabitants, such as fish – remains to be explored”.  Eakin says “we’ve already reached” a tipping point for corals on a global basis because of climate change:  “We are already seeing severe bleaching around the world and the recent 2014-17 global coral bleaching event has been devastating for many reefs around the world. For example, the Great Barrier Reef lost half of its corals in just two years.”  A 2018 Nature paper describes the recent bleaching as “a watershed for the Great Barrier Reef, and for many other severely affected reefs elsewhere in the Indo-Pacific Ocean”.  The study warns that “the most likely scenario” is that “coral reefs throughout the tropics will continue to degrade over the current century until climate change stabilises, allowing remnant populations to reorganize into novel, heat-tolerant reef assemblages”.  The 2016 marine heatwave “has triggered the initial phase of that transition on the northern, most-pristine region of the Great Barrier Reef”, the study says, “changing it forever as the intensity of global warming continues to escalate”. It concludes:  “The large-scale loss of functionally diverse corals is a harbinger of further radical shifts in the condition and dynamics of all ecosystems, reinforcing the need for risk assessment of ecosystem collapse, especially if global action on climate change fails to limit warming to 1.5-2C.”  The widespread loss of coral reefs would be devastating for ecosystems, economies and people. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), “despite covering less than 0.1% of the ocean floor, reefs host more than one quarter of all marine fish species”. Coral reefs also “directly support over 500 million people worldwide, who rely on them for daily subsistence, mostly in poor countries”, the IUCN adds.  Back to top  Indian monsoon shift  India receives around 70% of its annual rainfall during the monsoon season. For some areas of western and central India, it accounts for as much as 90%. The monsoon rains are crucial for India’s farm sector, which makes up about a sixth of India’s economy and employs about half of the country’s 1.3 billion population.  The Indian monsoon – also known as the South Asian monsoon – is a sub-system of the wider Asian monsoon, along with the south-east Asian monsoon and the western North Pacific monsoon. (Some consider the Asian monsoon to have more than three parts.)  The word “monsoon” originates from the Arabic word for season. It describes a seasonal shift in winds – specifically a 180-degree reversal that triggers the change from the dry to the wet season.  This shift is driven by the movements of the sun through the seasons, explains Dr Andrew Turner, associate professor in monsoon systems at the University of Reading. In the northern hemisphere winter, the focus of the sun’s energy is over the southern hemisphere. This causes a prevailing wind over India from the north-east, bringing dry air from across the Asian landmass.  The transition to the wet season arrives as the sun moves north of the equator in spring and early summer. Here, “northern India, the Tibetan Plateau and surrounding regions heat up rapidly”, Turner explains to Carbon Brief:  “They heat up more quickly than nearby oceans – for example, the northern Indian Ocean – since land (soil) has a much lower heat capacity than water.”  The contrast in heating between the land and ocean causes a pressure gradient that drives southwesterly winds across India. “This air travels northward from the Indian Ocean,” says Turner, picking up moisture as it goes. The rains typically begin in June – the official start date of the monsoon season is 1 June – moving north through India. The rains continue until the monsoon starts to withdraw from northern India by the end of August, as the strength and duration of the summer sun decreases. The rains then peter out for most of the country through September and October.  The maps below show the average monsoon onset (left) and withdrawal (right) dates across India.

Gadgil ( 2018 ) The monsoon system: Land–sea breeze or the ITCZ?, Journal of Earth System Science.  “At a fundamental level, the pressure gradient between the Indian Ocean and Asian continent determines the strength of the Asian monsoon”, says the IPCC’s special report on 1.5C. And so, in theory, “anything which alters either the north-south temperature gradient, or the amount of moisture evaporated from the ocean, could change the monsoon rains”, notes Turner.  With land areas warming faster than oceans, a strengthening of this pressure gradient and the monsoon itself “may be expected under global warming”, says the 1.5C report. In addition, as a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture, this may also result in “modest increases in rainfall”, says Turner.  However, a review study in 2012 – led by Turner – concludes that “the evidence for such trends in observations is unpersuasive”. While the observed record for the strength of the Indian monsoon shows a lot of variability, it does “suggest a negative trend since 1950”, the paper says. This amounts to a rainfall decline of around 10% in central India, adds Turner.  A potential cause could be air pollution – from India itself and the wider region, Turner says:  “Air pollution comes in several forms, but most of it is in the form of sulphur compounds – for example, emissions of sulphur dioxide from industry and transport – that form sulphates in the atmosphere. These particles have reflective properties, which act to reflect solar radiation and prevent some of it reaching the surface.”  This pollution “will preferentially cool the northern hemisphere region over Eurasia relative to the equator or southern Indian Ocean – where there are no pollution emissions”, says Turner. Increasing trends in air pollution in South Asia could explain “why seasonal mean rainfall over India has not shown increases in the recent observed record despite increasing CO2”, his paper says. Another study says the aerosol cooling in South and East Asia “may have masked up to 1C of greenhouse-gas-induced surface warming since the pre-industrial era”.  The mix of influences resulting from human activity is one of the reasons that making projections for the monsoon is tricky. Another is that climate models can struggle to simulate the monsoon system, in part because of the intricate interplay of circulation, temperature and topography that drives it.  Some papers have suggested the possibility for more abrupt changes in the Indian monsoon. A 2005 study, for example, used a simple model to identify the possibility of the monsoon having two stable states: wet (as it is now) and second state characterised by low rainfall.  Key to these two states is the so-called “moisture‐advection feedback”. This, the paper explains, is where “the land‐to‐ocean pressure gradient, which drives the monsoon circulation, is reinforced by the moisture the monsoon itself carries from the adjacent Indian Ocean”.  In other words, a significant factor in maintaining the monsoon is the heat released when the water vapour it holds condenses to form rain. Another paper, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) in 2009, suggests this feedback acts as an “internal amplifier” for the monsoon.  The implication is that this feedback magnifies anything that affects the air pressure gradient generated by warm air rising over the Asian landmass. Thus “relatively weak external perturbations” could lead to “abrupt changes” in the monsoon, the PNAS paper says.  The model simulations in the 2005 study suggest how a switch between states could be triggered. This includes cooling of the land surface through large amounts of air pollution, cooling through very low CO2 levels in the atmosphere, or a combination of the two.  Palaeoclimate studies, using “proxy” reconstructions of past conditions, suggest that shifts to a low rainfall monsoon state have occurred in the past in response to changes in how much of the sun’s radiation reaches the Earth’s surface. For example, in the last ice age and during more recent cold periods such as the Little Ice Age.  However, a 2006 study also shows that the albedo changes required to push the monsoon into a dry state – as in the 2005 study – are a long way from modern conditions. Therefore, the authors conclude, “we can be very certain that we will not reach this point in the near future”.  Glossary Albedo: Close This is a measure of how much of the sun's energy is reflected by a surface. It is derived from the Latin word albus, meaning white. Albedo is measured as a percentage or fraction of the sun’s energy that is reflected away. Snow and ice tend to have a higher albedo than, for example, soil, forests and open water.

Albedo is measured as a percentage… Read More  Nonetheless, the existence of the “moisture‐advection feedback” is still disputed. In an illustration of how contested the theory of potential abrupt shifts in the Indian monsoon is, PNAS have since published a response to the original 2009 paper, a reply to that response and a reply to that reply.  Dr William Boos, associate professor at the University of California, Berkeley and author of the PNAS response paper, tells Carbon Brief:  “The key phrase here is ‘abrupt shift’ – monsoons may change a lot, but there simply is no evidence for them being here one year and gone the next in response to human-induced climate change.”  The “vast majority of studies on abrupt changes in monsoons focus on changes that are ‘abrupt’ relative to the past evolution of the climate system that occurred over tens of thousands to millions of years”, adds Boos:  “Palaeo changes are important, but their relevance to human-caused climate change is unclear; feedbacks that take hundreds to thousands of years to operate – involving large changes in ice sheets or continental vegetation and soil types – may not be relevant if we are interested in changes taking place over a few years or a few decades.”  Prof Anji Seth, who leads a physical climate research group at the University of Connecticut, agrees that “there is no evidence that there is a tipping point where you would go from a wet monsoon to a threshold of very dry”. She tells Carbon Brief:  “All the evidence from proxy data in the past shows that when there is less insolation [incoming solar radiation], less radiative forcing, the monsoons are weaker, and when there’s more, they’re stronger – but it’s a very linear relationship. There are no thresholds seen where there are two stable states in the monsoon.”  Overall, the IPCC’s 1.5C report concludes that there is “low confidence” in any projected changes in the Indian monsoon under warming of 1.5-2C, but that increases in the intensity of monsoon rainfall are “likely” in a 3C warmer world.  For the IPCC’s fifth assessment report (“AR5”), published in 2013, all the models assessed “project an increase in mean precipitation as well as its interannual variability and extremes” (pdf), the report says.  While for monsoon systems more generally, the AR5 summary for policymakers (pdf) says:  “Globally, it is likely that the area encompassed by monsoon systems will increase over the 21st century. While monsoon winds are likely to weaken, monsoon precipitation is likely to intensify due to the increase in atmospheric moisture. Monsoon onset dates are likely to become earlier or not to change much. Monsoon retreat dates will likely be delayed, resulting in lengthening of the monsoon season in many regions.”  Back to top  Greenland ice sheet disintegration  The Greenland ice sheet is the second largest mass of ice on Earth. It holds enough water to raise global sea levels by 7.2 metres and, as a result, its disintegration would change the shape of the world’s coastlines.  Aerial view of the Greenland ice sheet. Credit: imageBROKER / Alamy Stock Photo.  Melting of the Greenland ice sheet is accelerating and it is currently adding around 0.7mm to global sea levels each year.  A tipping point for Greenland ice melt is unlikely to be abrupt, says climate scientist Dr Ruth Mottram of the Danish Meteorological Institute, but it is clear that there will be a threshold beyond which its eventual collapse is irreversible.  Around half of the melt that the Greenland ice sheet experiences occurs at the surface. The remainder occurs through melting at the ice sheet base and via the breaking off, or “calving”, of icebergs from its edge.  Surface melt is likely to involve a number of different self-reinforcing feedback loops that can speed up melting, explains Mottram. She tells Carbon Brief:  “Probably the most important ‘tipping point’ feedback though are elevation feedbacks – as the ice sheet gets lower via melting, more are areas are at lower and warmer altitudes, leading to further melting.”  In the clip below, Dr Ricarda Winkelmann of PIK outlines the processes involved in a tipping point for the Greenland ice sheet.  Also important is the “snowline” – the elevation at which the ice sheet is covered in snow. Bright white snow has a higher albedo than dark, bare ice – which means it reflects back much more of the sun’s energy. So if the snowline migrates to higher elevations as the ice sheet warms, it means the ice will be absorbing more of the incoming solar radiation, causing more melting.  Research published in 2019 found that snowline migration accounted for more than half of the year-to-year variations in how much of the sun’s energy was available for melting.  In addition, as meltwater trickles down into the snowpack, it fills the pores in the snow and gives off more heat when it refreezes. This “makes it harder for the snowpack to hold further meltwater, so any additional meltwater will run off directly into the sea”, Mottram says.  The combination of these processes means that a tipping point in Greenland ice melt is “very much related to how much melting is happening at the surface and how much of a snowpack there is to absorb that meltwater”, says Mottram. This has “cascading consequences as the meltwater can affect ice sheet flow speeds and calving processes”.  The lPCC’s most recent full assessment report – AR5, published in 2013 – concluded that (pdf) it is “exceptionally unlikely” that the Greenland ice sheet will suffer near-complete disintegration in the 21st century – equivalent to a 0-1% likelihood of it happening.  However, more recent research suggests that the ice sheet is at risk on longer timescales. A review paper in Nature Climate Change in 2018 concluded that 1.8C (with a range of 1.1-2.3C) of warming above pre-industrial levels would be enough to trigger feedback loops of decline in parts of the ice sheet in summer.  This could set in motion a pattern of melt that takes thousands of years, the paper concluded:  “Thus, crossing the limit of 1.5C global warming this century may impose a commitment to much larger and possibly irreversible changes in the far future.”  The IPCC’s special report on 1.5C – published in 2018 – noted that a “useful indicator” for the elevation feedback mentioned above is the “threshold at which annual mass loss from the ice sheet by surface melt exceeds mass gain by snowfall”.  (This means a negative surface mass balance (SMB) over the course of the year. As an example, the SMB for 2019 was 169bn tonnes of ice, the seventh lowest on record. Total mass balance – which includes the ice lost through calving and ocean melt – switched from overall gains to overall losses between the 1970s and 1980s.)  The most recent studies suggest that this threshold “sits between 0.8C and 3.2C, with a best estimate at 1.6C”, the special report says, adding:  “The continued decline of the ice sheet after this threshold has been passed is highly dependent on the future climate and varies between about 80% loss after 10,000 years to complete loss after as little as 2000 years (contributing about six metres to sea level rise).”  The fate of the Greenland ice sheet is, therefore, still strongly dependent on the rate of greenhouse gas emissions in future. A 2019 modelling study published in Science simulated the Greenland ice sheet out to the year 3000 under different emissions scenarios. It found:  “In a thousand years, the Greenland ice sheet will look significantly different than today. Depending on the emission scenario, the Greenland ice sheet will have lost 8 to 25% (RCP2.6), 26 to 57% (RCP4.5), or 72 to 100% (RCP8.5) of its present-day mass, contributing 0.59 to 1.88 metres, 1.86 to 4.17 metres, or 5.23 to 7.28 metres to global mean sea level, respectively.”  This is illustrated in the maps below, taken from the paper, which show the observed state of the ice sheet (A) and the projected ice cover by the year 3000 under the three different scenarios (B to D). The shading in the maps shows the likelihood of future ice cover, with dark blue areas indicating areas with remaining ice in 16% of model runs, blue for 50% of model runs and white for 84%.

The IPCC’s special report on the ocean and cryosphere in a changing climate (“SROCC”) also notes that decay of the ice sheet would not be abrupt. It does say, however, that the decay would be “irreversible for millennia” once underway. This is the same phrasing as used in AR5.  While it is possible that the ice sheet could stabilise at some intermediate point during its collapse, it would not regain its previous vast size until the next ice age, says Mottram:  “It is clear from even very early work that the ice sheet is only there because it is already there – if there was no ice sheet in Greenland under today’s climate we would not be able to build it up again. So once it’s gone it’s gone until at least the next glacial period – and we’ll be waiting some tens of thousands of years given current climate change and the slow rate of carbon removal by natural means.”  Back to top  Boreal forest shift  Boreal forests are found in the cold climates of the northern hemisphere high latitudes. They lie just to the south of the Arctic tundra, where tree growth is restricted by year-round freezing or near-freezing temperatures and a lack of rain.  Known as the “taiga” in Russia, boreal forests are characterised by species that can cope with the cold, such as pine, spruce and larch. They cover vast stretches of North America and northern Europe and Asia.  Boreal forests are the largest “biome”, or ecosystem, anywhere on the Earth’s land surface and account for 30% of the world’s forests. They are a very important store of carbon. While there is a lot of uncertainty around the precise amount of carbon they hold, estimates suggest it is more than one third of all terrestrial carbon.  And about a third of the boreal biome is underlain by permafrost.  However, the boreal zone, along with the tundra, is warming rapidly – approximately twice as quickly as the global average. Continued temperature rise could generate rapid changes in boreal forests, including dieback. A 2012 study explains:  “Increasingly warm summers becoming too hot for the currently dominant tree species, increased vulnerability to disease, decreased reproduction rates and more frequent fires causing significantly higher mortality, all contribute.”  A 2017 Nature Climate Change review paper concluded that rapid warming and “naturally lower tree species diversity” could put boreal regions at particular risk of natural forest “disturbances” by factors such as drought, fire, pests and disease. When compared to other ecosystems around the world, the study finds that “future changes in disturbance are likely to be most pronounced in coniferous forests and the boreal biome”.  For example, a 2014 study finds that “continued summer warming in the absence of sustained increases in precipitation” brought about a “turning point” around the mid-1990s that “shifted western central Eurasian boreal forests into a warmer and drier regime”. Research also indicates that “rather than showing gradual responses”, boreal ecosystems “will tend to shift relatively sharply between alternative states in response to climate change”.  Prof Scott Goetz from Northern Arizona University, who is science lead on NASA’s Arctic Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE), explains to Carbon Brief how disturbances could cause forests to “tip”:  “An example of a tipping point in boreal forests is a situation where an extreme fire event or repeated severe events render the system incapable of regenerating as a forest ecosystem and instead shifts the system to a sparsely wooded or grassland ecosystem.”  This is more likely to occur at the hotter and drier southern margins of the forest, says Goetz. But a “similar tipping point could occur without fire when extreme drought events kill a large proportion of the trees and composition shifts to other species”, he adds. A new modelling study shows these changes will result in much reduced “aboveground” biomass – i.e. all the living biomass above the soil, including branches, bark and foliage.  The IPCC’s special report on 1.5C notes that “increased tree mortality would result in the creation of large regions of open woodlands and grasslands, which would favour further regional warming and increased fire frequencies, thus inducing a powerful positive feedback mechanism”.  As a result, says Dr Brendan Rogers, assistant scientist at the Woods Hole Research Center, “in places that may transition to grasslands, recurring fire regimes may keep the system in a perpetual treeless state”.  At the southern margins of boreal forests, “aspen and spruce species are most at risk”, says Goetz and, therefore, most likely to be replaced:  “Pine species, shrubs and grasses, as well as more temperate tree species – oaks and maples – will be those most likely to fill the gaps the boreal species leave behind, at least in North America. In northern Eurasia, we’d expect pine species to dominate areas of the currently widespread larch forests.”  A 2012 study of forests in Alaska, for example, identified “a widespread shift from coniferous to deciduous vegetation [that] began around 1990 and will continue over the next several decades”.  But while trees at the southern edge of the boreal zone risk dieback, research suggests that forests at the northern edge could move into tundra under climate change. A 2018 modelling study finds that, even if the Paris warming limits are met, “boreal forests are simulated to expand into the tundra, while on the other hand tree composition shifts toward temperate species along their warm edge”.  Under the existing Paris emissions reduction pledges, the study projects “major climate change effects for more than 80% of the tundra and more than 40% of all boreal forests”.  The graphic below, published in the IPCC’s fifth assessment report in 2014, illustrates the factors involved in a northwards shift of the boreal biome into the tundra.  Illustration of the potential tundra-boreal biome shift under a warming climate. Credit: IPCC ( 2014 ) WG2 Fig4-10.  There is already evidence of boreal forests shifting. The IPCC’s 1.5C reports concludes that it has “high confidence” that “woody shrubs are already encroaching into tundra and will proceed with further warming”.  It also says that abrupt increases in tree cover are “unlikely” at 1.5-2C of warming. Above 2C of warming, there is “potential” for abrupt increases, the report says – albeit with “low confidence”.  For the boreal biome, the report says there is “medium confidence” of “further increases in tree mortality” at the southern boundary at 1.5C and 2C of warming. While “a drastic biome shift from tundra to boreal forest is possible” beyond 2C, it says there is “low confidence” in this projection.  It further notes that a potential “tipping point has been estimated to exist between 3C and 4C of global warming (low confidence), but given the complexities of the various forcing mechanisms and feedback processes involved, this is thought to be an uncertain estimate”.  Significant changes in boreal forests are made more likely by the rapid rate of warming, says Goetz:  “I don’t know that anyone has put a number on a species-specific tipping point, but we have high confidence that with global temperature increases of 1.5 or 2C, which in the boreal will translate into about double those temperature increases, we will see widespread changes in tree species composition and fire regimes.”  Such changes could occur within decades, he adds:  “Fire frequency and severity is the big factor here. With more severe fires and especially with more frequent severe fires, which burn off the organic soil layer, we’d expect to see a shift in forest species over the next two-to-three decades that would persist for many decades to come.”  Shifts in vegetation cover will affect the reflectivity of the land surface – known as its “albedo”, says Prof Colin Prentice, chair in biosphere and climate impacts at Imperial College London. He tells Carbon Brief:  “Northward expansion of the boreal forest is certainly expected as a result of warming and, indeed, there is evidence that it is happening already. Similarly, shrub tundra is expanding into colder regions as a result of warming and this process will continue…There will be, as a result, a decrease in vegetation albedo – especially in spring – which will amplify the warming locally. This is well attested both from first principles and climate model experiments.”  This “would lead to increased heat absorption in the Arctic and more rapid permafrost thaw”, says Goetz:  “Obviously great permafrost degradation means a lot more carbon emitted to the atmosphere, which would have the effect of increasing the cycle of warming and even more degradation, with global implications.”  Rogers agrees that the change in albedo is a key impact of shifting boreal forests. He tells Carbon Brief:  “We know from palaeoclimate literature that northward forest and tall shrub migration is a major Earth system feedback, mostly because of the darkened surface. This is particularly important in the late winter and spring due to the combination of high snow cover and moderate incoming solar radiation.”  In fact, he adds, “the full extent of ice ages [in Earth’s history] is impossible without this feedback”. For the modern day, “we expect this to be a warming effect, and we’re already witnessing shrubs getting denser and taller, and trees migrating north”, he says.  Carbon emissions from permafrost thaw and dieback of forests at the southern edge of the boreal biome would be a “double-whammy”, says Rogers.  However, the uncertainties in predictive models mean that scientists cannot be sure of when these shifts will happen across boreal forests, notes Rogers. And it is still not clear whether it “represents a true ‘tipping point’ or more of a gradual transition”, he adds:  “Certainly for any one location, there likely exists a tipping point beyond which the forest will be fundamentally altered – and wildfire can facilitate and exacerbate these transitions. But the boreal is a vast zone, with variation in climates and landscapes that may ‘tip’ at different times.”  Prentice argues that a gradual shift is more likely. “There are thresholds,” he notes, in terms of the conditions required for particular tree species to thrive at certain latitudes or elevations. But, he says, “the effect of warming is simply to gradually shift the geographic location of the threshold”.  He also says that neither the northward expansion of boreal forests nor their contraction in the south are likely to be irreversible:  “Cooling would send them into reverse. It is worth noting also that very large shifts in the distribution of the boreal forests have happened in the relatively recent geological past in response to natural climate changes that are reasonably well understood.”  However, Goetz points out that “fire is the wildcard and can shift forests much more rapidly than from warming effects on tree growth alone”. And Rogers adds that while “forest composition may be reversible”, the carbon emitted from thawing permafrost “would take much, much longer” to reaccumulate:  “That carbon took millennia to be sequestered by the land and gradually accumulate in frozen soil layers.”  Back to top  Other tipping points  The nine tipping points described above do not constitute an exhaustive list – indeed there are a number of other parts of the Earth system that have the potential to display tipping point behaviour.  Some examples include: shutdown of Antarctic bottom water formation; loss of alpine glaciers; a climate change-induced hole in the ozone layer above the Arctic; ocean anoxia (where areas of the ocean see a dramatic decline in oxygen); and a change in the frequency and/or strength of El Niño events.  Another example that is often cited is the decline of Arctic sea ice. Climate model simulations have suggested that summer sea ice extent in the Arctic could see abrupt and accelerating declines during this century. Such a potential decline is associated with the ice-albedo mechanism, explains Dr Dirk Notz, head of the Sea ice in the Earth system research group at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology. He tells Carbon Brief:  “Less sea ice in one year implies more absorption of solar heat by the ocean, thus more warmth available to melt ice further, thus causing less sea ice the year after.”  The “idea of such a sea-ice tipping point was quite popular perhaps a decade ago”, says Prof Mark Serreze, director of the US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC). A 2005 paper in the Journal of Climate, for example, asked “Have we passed a tipping point?“ in response to thinning Arctic sea ice between 1988 and 2003.  However, the theory has not been supported by the latest research, Serreze tells Carbon Brief:  “More recent work argues that the trajectory to a seasonally ice-free ocean will be pretty much along the path that we are observing – a downward trend with strong ups and downs from year to year (and over multiple years) reflecting the influences of natural variability.”  Research by Notz and colleagues, for example, has shown that large declines in summer sea ice are reversible. Notz explains:  “After a year with anomalously little sea ice, the sea ice usually recovers somewhat in the year afterwards. This is because in addition to the amplifying ice-albedo feedback, there are dampening feedbacks that stabilise the ice cover from one year to the next.”  For example, less ice in summer means more open water going into winter. Without the insulating effect of the ice, the Arctic Ocean subsequently loses a greater amount of heat, which means it sees more ice growth in winter. In addition, thin ice in winter grows faster than thick ice, giving the chance for some degree of recovery after a small extent in summer.  Arctic sea ice breaking apart.

These feedbacks “imply that the memory of the sea ice cover is largely reset during winter”, says Notz, making the ice loss approximately linear in response to rising greenhouse gases.  However, while sea ice itself might not be a tipping element, ecological systems associated with it might well be, adds Notz:  “If the ice is gone completely in a given summer, any ecosystem that needs the continuous existence of sea ice might be wiped out ‘forever’.”  Another concern around tipping points is the potential for one to trigger a “cascade” effect on others. A Nature commentary from November 2019, for example, argues that “cascading effects might be common” in the Earth system, warning that this would be “an existential threat to civilization”.  It references a 2018 Science paper that assessed how 30 different potential social-ecological “regime shifts” could interact with o",Explainer: Nine ‘tipping points’ that could be triggered by climate change,true

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh, File)  NEW YORK (AP) — James Hansen wishes he was wrong. He wasn’t.  NASA’s top climate scientist in 1988, Hansen warned the world on a record hot June day 30 years ago that global warming was here and worsening. In a scientific study that came out a couple months later, he even forecast how warm it would get, depending on emissions of heat-trapping gases.  The hotter world that Hansen envisioned in 1988 has pretty much come true so far, more or less. Three decades later, most climate scientists interviewed rave about the accuracy of Hansen’s predictions given the technology of the time.  ADVERTISEMENT  Hansen won’t say, “I told you so.”  “I don’t want to be right in that sense,” Hansen told The Associated Press, in an interview is his New York penthouse apartment. That’s because being right means the world is warming at an unprecedented pace and ice sheets in Antarctica and Greenland are melting.  Hansen said what he really wishes happened is “that the warning be heeded and actions be taken.”  They weren’t. Hansen, now 77, regrets not being “able to make this story clear enough for the public.”  Global warming was not what Hansen set out to study when he joined NASA in 1972. The Iowa native studied Venus — a planet with a runaway greenhouse-effect run — when he got interested in Earth’s ozone hole. As he created computer simulations, he realized that “this planet was more interesting than Venus.” And more important.  In his 1988 study, Hansen and colleagues used three different scenarios for emissions of heat-trapping gases — high, low and medium. Hansen and other scientists concentrated on the middle scenario.  Hansen projected that by 2017, the globe’s five-year average temperature would be about 1.85 degrees (1.03 degree Celsius) higher than the 1950 to 1980 NASA-calculated average. NASA’s five-year average global temperature ending in 2017 was 1.48 degrees above the 30-year average. (He did not take into account that the sun would be cooling a tad, which would reduce warming nearly two-tenths of a degree Fahrenheit, said the Scripps Institution of Oceanography’s Jeff Severinghaus.)  Hansen also predicted a certain number of days of extreme weather — temperature above 95 degrees, freezing days, and nights when the temperatures that don’t drop below 75 — per year for four U.S. cities in the decade of the 2010s.  Hansen’s forecast generally underestimated this decade’s warming in Washington, overestimated it in Omaha, was about right in New York and mixed in Memphis.  ADVERTISEMENT  Clara Deser, climate analysis chief at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, said Hansen’s global temperature forecast was “incredible” and his extremes for the cities were “astounding” in their accuracy. Berkeley Earth’s Zeke Hausfather gives Hansen’s predictions a 7 or 8 for accuracy, out of 10; he said Hansen calculated that the climate would respond a bit more to carbon dioxide than scientists now think.  University of Alabama Huntsville’s John Christy, a favorite of those who downplay climate change, disagreed. Using mathematical formulas to examine Hansen’s projections, he concluded: “Hansen’s predictions were wrong as demonstrated by hypothesis testing.”  Hansen had testified before Congress on climate change at a fall 1987 hearing that didn’t get much attention — likely because it was a cool day, he figured.  So the next hearing was scheduled for the next summer, and the weather added heat to Hansen’s words. At 2 p.m., the temperature hit a record high 98 degrees and felt like 102.  It was then and there that Hansen went out on a limb and proclaimed that global warming was already here. Until then most scientists merely warned of future warming.  He left NASA in 2013, devoting more time to what he calls his “anti-government job” of advocacy.  Hansen, still at Columbia University, has been arrested five times for environmental protests. Each time, he hoped to go to trial “to draw attention to the issues” but the cases were dropped. He writes about saving the planet for his grandchildren, including one who is suing the federal government over global warming inaction. His advocacy has been criticized by scientific colleagues, but he makes no apologies.  “If scientists are not allowed to talk about the policy implications of the science, who is going to do that? People with financial interests?” Hansen asked.  ___  Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter at @borenbears .

Data about eruptions has been compiled by the Smithsonian since 1968 in order to provide context for global volcanism. The following figures and discussion are modified from an introductory section in Siebert et al. (2010); data is through 2009, but more recent data is available. Please do not reproduce the figures below without all of the accompanying analysis and proper citation (links are preferred). There is great value in knowing the recent volcanological record, but its limitations are not always apparent. Readers are strongly cautioned against mistaking the record for the reality.  The last 200 years of the volcanological record (figure 1), with humans distributed over most of the globe and relatively efficient communications, would seem to be the well-suited to search for episodic trends. However, even in the last two centuries any real trends are overshadowed by reporting factors such as historical events, technological changes, and exploration influences. The apparent increase in activity reflects increases in populations living near volcanoes to observe eruptions and improvements in communication technologies to report those eruptions. The best evidence that these trends are apparent rather than real comes from the record of large eruptions, whose effects are far reaching and less likely to escape documentation even in remote areas. Their constancy over the past two centuries is a better indicator of the global frequency of eruptions than the improved reporting of smaller eruptions.  Figure 1. Graph showing the number of volcanoes reported to have been active each year since 1800 CE. Total number of volcanoes with reported eruptions per year (thin upper black line) and 10-year running mean of same data (thick upper red line). Lower lines show only the annual number of volcanoes producing large eruptions (>= 0.1 km3 of tephra or magma) and scale is enlarged on the right axis; thick red lower line again shows 10-year running mean. See text for discussion.  Inspection of data since 1800 CE shows some major ""peaks and valleys"" which suggest global pulsations. A closer look at the two largest valleys, however, shows that they coincide with the two World Wars, when people (including publishers) were preoccupied with other things. Great economic crises, like wars, might also be expected to interfere with the reporting of natural events. One of the most precipitous drops in reported volcanism followed the stock market collapse of 1929 and during the ensuing Great Depression. From the late 1920's to the early 1930's, every volcanic region in the world – except those of Russia, Melanesia, and the West Indies – showed a drop in reported active volcanoes. In the war years of 1941-45 the number reported active in the western Pacific and Indonesia dropped by nearly one-third from the preceding 5 years, while regions less affected by the war showed little change. With more observers in more remote areas during World War II, it seems likely that more eruptions than normal were actually witnessed, but it is easy to appreciate why many of these reports do not survive in the available literature.  If these apparent drops in activity are caused by decreased human attention to volcanoes, then it is reasonable to expect that increased attention after major newsworthy eruptions should result in above-average numbers being reported. The 1902 disasters at Mont Pelee (about 29,000 victims), St. Vincent, and Santa Maria were highly newsworthy events. They represent a genuine pulse in Caribbean volcanism, but we believe that the higher numbers in following years (and following Krakatau in 1883 with more than 36,000 victims) result from increased human interest. People reported events that they might not otherwise have, and editors were more likely to print those reports.  Strong evidence that the historical trend in volcanism is more apparent than real comes from the lower plot of figure 1. Here only the larger eruptions generating at least 0.1 km3 of tephra (VEI >= 4), the fragmental products of explosive eruptions, are plotted. The effects of these larger events are often regional, and therefore less likely to escape documentation even in remote areas. The frequency of these events has remained impressively constant for more than a century, and contrasts strongly with the apparent increase of smaller eruptions with time. The effects of these large eruptions are far reaching and thus they are less likely to escape documentation even in remote areas.  More recent major eruptions have not had this effect, in part due to more systematic cataloging and media focus on volcanic events. The newsworthiness of an eruption depends more on its location and human impact than on its size. The 1980 St. Helens eruption, for example, generated enormous media attention, while the remarkably similar 1956 eruption of Bezymianny in sparsely populated Kamchatka, in which no lives were lost, was hardly noticed by the world press. Similarly, the 1991 Pinatubo eruption, with its many fatalities and effects on nearby military bases, was front page news, but the eruption of Cerro Hudson that year in isolated southern Chile created barely a ripple in international interest.  A sharp rise in reported active volcanoes immediately post-WW II was followed by another steep increase in the early 1950s that has no obvious relationship to historic events. There is then a transition from a sequence of peaks and valleys to a more uniform pattern. This corresponds to the establishment of three venues of global eruption documentation: the beginning of the Catalog of Active Volcanoes of the World series with eruption-rich Indonesia in 1951, publication of the annual Bulletin of Volcanic Eruptions of the Volcanological Society of Japan in 1960, and Smithsonian cataloging beginning in 1968.  Yet another rise in reported activity can be noted in the late 1990s. Several new reporting effects appear to have contributed to this change. These include widespread availability of internet access and the corresponding ability to quickly and easily transmit or publish reports, the increased utilization of remote-sensing satellite data by volcano observatories, the onset of systematic reporting of ash plumes by the Volcanic Ash Advisory Centers (VAACs) to mitigate aircraft-ash interactions, and the deployment of new satellite technology starting in December 1999 with NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) Terra satellite. Its MODIS infrared sensors have detected volcanic eruptions in sparsely populated or rarely visited regions. These collective ""eyes in the skies"" have detected eruptions that might otherwise go unreported. Another contributing factor may have been the onset of more systematic weekly documentation of current volcanism by the Smithsonian and USGS in 2000.  The last 600 years of apparent global volcanism can be displayed by plotting the number of volcanoes known to have been active each year (figure 2). At first glance the nearly exponential increase through recent centuries suggests that the planet may soon be overwhelmed by volcanic activity, but this increase tracks the striking growth of global population (dashed line on figure 1) that has spread potential observers of eruptions over much of the Earth and the technological advances that have facilitated reporting of those eruptions. Another indicator of the growth of the record is the increase in the total number of known historically active volcanoes (upper line on figure 2). These are not newly-formed volcanoes, but already established features (or volcanic fields) that clearly had numerous previous eruptions. If a list had been continuously kept, about 2000 years ago it would have contained only the names of nine Mediterranean volcanoes and West Africa's Mount Cameroon. In the next ten centuries the list would have grown by only 30 names, 18 of them Japanese. Although newly settled Iceland soon added seven volcanoes, the list totaled only 63 by 1400 CE.  Figure 2. Graph showing known historically active volcanoes, number of volcanoes reported to be active each year, and population. The line labeled ""Known Historically Active Volcanoes"" (right scale) is the cumulative number of volcanoes with an historically recorded eruption by that year. ""Volcanoes Active Per Year"" since 1400 CE (black line) and 10-year running mean of same data (thick red line) is also based on reported eruptions (those with uncertainty dates greater than 1 year are not included, nor are uncertain eruptions). ""Population"" (right scale) is the world's estimated human population; data from McEvedy and Jones (1978) and (since 1750) Population Reference Bureau, Washington, D.C. See text for further explanation.  A dramatic increase in both the number of historically active volcanoes and recorded eruptions took place about 1500 CE. These resulted in part from the great Spanish/Portuguese marine explorations – the Age of Discovery – around the end of the 15th century, when explorers opened Latin America and much of the western Pacific to European record-keeping. Perhaps equally important was the development and widespread distribution of the printing press in the late 15th century, markedly increasing the likelihood that new volcanological records would survive. Through the 17th and into the early 18th century the recognition of additional active volcanoes generally corresponded with steadily increasing eruption reports. By the 18th century global trade was flourishing, the Industrial Revolution was under way, and the heightened reporting of eruptions noticeably accelerated the discovery of new volcanoes. The list has continued to grow, with several important volcanic regions such as New Zealand, Alaska, and Hawaii being unrepresented until the last 250 years.

230,233238683355028709590047045417625638315,"The government’s top Great Barrier Reef scientist says a third mass bleaching event in five years is a clear signal the marine wonder is “calling for urgent help” on climate change.  One quarter of the Great Barrier Reef suffered severe bleaching this summer in the most widespread outbreak ever witnessed, according to analysis of aerial surveys of more than 1,000 individual reefs released on Tuesday.  Dr David Wachenfeld, chief scientist at the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, told Guardian Australia: “My greatest fear is that people will lose hope for the reef. Without hope there’s no action.  “People need to see these [bleaching] events not as depressing bits of news that adds to other depressing bits of news. They are clear signals the Great Barrier Reef is calling for urgent help and for us to do everything we can.”  Prof Terry Hughes, director of the Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies at James Cook University, surveyed 1,036 reefs from a plane over nine days in late March. The marine park authority also had an observer on the flights.  Hughes has released maps showing severe levels of bleaching occurred in 2020 in all three sections of the reef – northern, central and southern – the first time this has happened since mass bleaching was first seen in 1998.  A coral bleaching map showing the worst affected areas in 2020 highlighted in red. Photograph: ARC Centre for Excellence in Coral Reef Studies  A bleaching map showing the worst affected areas in 2016-17. Photograph: ARC Centre for Excellence in Coral Reef Studies  Some 25% of the reefs were severely bleached – meaning that more than 60% of the corals on each reef had bleached.  Hughes said previous observations had shown that bleaching at that extent leads to “high levels of mortality” of corals.  The Great Barrier Reef has experienced five mass bleaching events – 1998, 2002, 2016, 2017 and 2020 – all caused by rising ocean temperatures driven by global heating.  Hughes said there probably would not be the same level of coral death in the north and central regions in 2020 as in previous years, but this was partly because previous bleaching outbreaks had killed off the less heat-tolerant species.  The 2020 bleaching was second only to 2016 for severity, Hughes said.  Corals can recover from mild bleaching, but scientists say those corals are more susceptible to disease. Severe bleaching can kill corals.  Hughes said severe mass bleaching had never before hit the southern section of the reef – from Mackay south. That area had high numbers of heat-sensitive corals that “light up like a Christmas tree” when viewed from the air.  “It’s not too late to turn this around with rapid action on emissions,” he said. “But business-as-usual emissions will make the the Great Barrier Reef a pretty miserable place compared to today.”  In February the reef was subjected to its hottest sea surface temperatures since records began in 1900.  Some scientists fear that rising levels of heat being taken up by the ocean have pushed tropical reefs to a tipping point at which many locations bleach almost annually.  Wachenfeld said the reef’s sheer size – it comprises about 3,000 individual reefs – made it resilient, “but climate change brings a new scale of impact unlike anything we have seen before”.  He told Guardian Australia: “Three mass bleaching events in five years is showing us the enormous scale at which climate change can operate.  “No one climate event will kill the Great Barrier Reef, but each successive event creates more damage. Its resilience is not limitless and we need the strongest possible action on climate change.”  The globe has already warmed by about 1C above pre-industrial levels, caused primarily by rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels.  Wachenfeld said: “We’re at about 1C and we have just had three marine heatwaves in five years that have all damaged the reef.”  Measures to improve the resilience of the reef include improving water quality, controlling outbreaks of coral-eating starfish, and research and development to improve the heat tolerance of corals.  “None of that is a substitute for strong action on emissions,” Wachenfeld said. “Dealing with the climate problem is the underpinning for everything else to work.”  Under the Paris climate agreement, countries agreed to deliver country-wide plans that would keep global heating well below 2C, with an aim to keep temperatures to 1.5C.  “That’s the window we have to aim for,” Wachenfeld said.  “As we approach and go beyond 2C, I don’t see the tools we have today, and the tools that research and development is working on, will protect the reef.  “The world is heading for 3C of warming – we will not be able to protect coral reefs under those circumstances.  “The reef is, after this event, a more damaged ecosystem, but it can still recover. It needs more help from us and it needs it urgently. This is a call to action.”  In a statement to Guardian Australia, the environment minister, Sussan Ley, said: “It is deeply concerning the reef has suffered another bleaching event and our focus has to be on the ways that we can reduce the pressure on the reef and strengthen its resilience.  “The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority has been monitoring the situation closely and highlighting the concerns over temperatures.  “Thankfully, some of the most recognised tourism areas have been less impacted but that does not change the importance of the issue and the importance of coordinated global action on emissions reduction to reduce ocean temperatures.”  Queensland’s minister for environment and the Great Barrier Reef, Leeanne Enoch, said climate change, pollution from run-off and other threats “are testing the reef’s ability to recover from major disturbances like mass bleaching events, severe tropical cyclones and crown-of-thorns starfish.”  She said the Palaszczuk government had “committed to a zero net emissions target by 2050” and allocated more than $427m for reef protection and resilience between 2015 and 2022.  “The missing piece continues to be leadership and action from the federal government on climate change,” she said.",Great Barrier Reef's third mass bleaching in five years the most widespread yet,true
231,164875171000985424656123266880071428516,"› en español  In Brief: Human activities (primarily the burning of fossil fuels) have fundamentally increased the concentration of greenhouse gases in Earth’s atmosphere, warming the planet. Natural drivers, without human intervention, would push our planet toward a cooling period.  Scientists attribute the global warming trend observed since the mid-20th century to the human expansion of the ""greenhouse effect""1 — warming that results when the atmosphere traps heat radiating from Earth toward space.  Certain gases in the atmosphere block heat from escaping. Long-lived gases that remain semi-permanently in the atmosphere and do not respond physically or chemically to changes in temperature are described as ""forcing"" climate change. Gases, such as water vapor, which respond physically or chemically to changes in temperature are seen as ""feedbacks.""  Gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect include:  Water vapor. The most abundant greenhouse gas, but importantly, it acts as a feedback to the climate. Water vapor increases as the Earth's atmosphere warms, but so does the possibility of clouds and precipitation, making these some of the most important feedback mechanisms to the greenhouse effect.  Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ). A minor but very important component of the atmosphere, carbon dioxide is released through natural processes such as respiration and volcano eruptions and through human activities such as deforestation, land use changes, and burning fossil fuels. Humans have increased atmospheric CO 2 concentration by 48% since the Industrial Revolution began. This is the most important long-lived ""forcing"" of climate change.  Methane. A hydrocarbon gas produced both through natural sources and human activities, including the decomposition of wastes in landfills, agriculture, and especially rice cultivation, as well as ruminant digestion and manure management associated with domestic livestock. On a molecule-for-molecule basis, methane is a far more active greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, but also one which is much less abundant in the atmosphere.  Nitrous oxide. A powerful greenhouse gas produced by soil cultivation practices, especially the use of commercial and organic fertilizers, fossil fuel combustion, nitric acid production, and biomass burning.  Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). Synthetic compounds entirely of industrial origin used in a number of applications, but now largely regulated in production and release to the atmosphere by international agreement for their ability to contribute to destruction of the ozone layer. They are also greenhouse gases.  Not enough greenhouse effect: The planet Mars has a very thin atmosphere, nearly all carbon dioxide. Because of the low atmospheric pressure, and with little to no methane or water vapor to reinforce the weak greenhouse effect, Mars has a largely frozen surface that shows no evidence of life.  Too much greenhouse effect: The atmosphere of Venus, like Mars, is nearly all carbon dioxide. But Venus has about 154,000 times as much carbon dioxide in its atmosphere as Earth (and about 19,000 times as much as Mars does), producing a runaway greenhouse effect and a surface temperature hot enough to melt lead.  On Earth, human activities are changing the natural greenhouse. Over the last century the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil has increased the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ). This happens because the coal or oil burning process combines carbon with oxygen in the air to make CO 2 . To a lesser extent, the clearing of land for agriculture, industry, and other human activities has increased concentrations of greenhouse gases.  The consequences of changing the natural atmospheric greenhouse are difficult to predict, but some effects seem likely:  On average, Earth will become warmer. Some regions may welcome warmer temperatures, but others may not.  Warmer conditions will probably lead to more evaporation and precipitation overall, but individual regions will vary, some becoming wetter and others dryer.  A stronger greenhouse effect will warm the ocean and partially melt glaciers and ice sheets, increasing sea level. Ocean water also will expand if it warms, contributing further to sea level rise.  Outside of a greenhouse, higher atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) levels can have both positive and negative effects on crop yields. Some laboratory experiments suggest that elevated CO 2 levels can increase plant growth. However, other factors, such as changing temperatures, ozone, and water and nutrient constraints, may more than counteract any potential increase in yield. If optimal temperature ranges for some crops are exceeded, earlier possible gains in yield may be reduced or reversed altogether. Climate extremes, such as droughts, floods and extreme temperatures, can lead to crop losses and threaten the livelihoods of agricultural producers and the food security of communities worldwide. Depending on the crop and ecosystem, weeds, pests, and fungi can also thrive under warmer temperatures, wetter climates, and increased CO 2 levels, and climate change will likely increase weeds and pests. Finally, although rising CO 2 can stimulate plant growth, research has shown that it can also reduce the nutritional value of most food crops by reducing the concentrations of protein and essential minerals in most plant species. Climate change can cause new patterns of pests and diseases to emerge, affecting plants, animals and humans, and posing new risks for food security, food safety and human health.2  The Role of Human Activity  In its Fifth Assessment Report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group of 1,300 independent scientific experts from countries all over the world under the auspices of the United Nations, concluded there's a more than 95 percent probability that human activities over the past 50 years have warmed our planet.  The industrial activities that our modern civilization depends upon have raised atmospheric carbon dioxide levels from 280 parts per million to about 417 parts per million in the last 151 years. The panel also concluded there's a better than 95 percent probability that human-produced greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide have caused much of the observed increase in Earth's temperatures over the past 50-plus years.  The panel's full Summary for Policymakers report is online at https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_summary-for-policymakers.pdf.  Solar Irradiance  The above graph compares global surface temperature changes (red line) and the Sun's energy that Earth receives (yellow line) in watts (units of energy) per square meter since 1880. The lighter/thinner lines show the yearly levels while the heavier/thicker lines show the 11-year average trends. Eleven-year averages are used to reduce the year-to-year natural noise in the data, making the underlying trends more obvious.    The amount of solar energy that Earth receives has followed the Sun’s natural 11-year cycle of small ups and downs with no net increase since the 1950s. Over the same period, global temperature has risen markedly. It is therefore extremely unlikely that the Sun has caused the observed global temperature warming trend over the past half-century. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech  It's reasonable to assume that changes in the Sun's energy output would cause the climate to change, since the Sun is the fundamental source of energy that drives our climate system.  Indeed, studies show that solar variability has played a role in past climate changes. For example, a decrease in solar activity coupled with an increase in volcanic activity is thought to have helped trigger the Little Ice Age between approximately 1650 and 1850, when Greenland cooled from 1410 to the 1720s and glaciers advanced in the Alps.  But several lines of evidence show that current global warming cannot be explained by changes in energy from the Sun:  Since 1750, the average amount of energy coming from the Sun either remained constant or increased slightly.  If the warming were caused by a more active Sun, then scientists would expect to see warmer temperatures in all layers of the atmosphere. Instead, they have observed a cooling in the upper atmosphere, and a warming at the surface and in the lower parts of the atmosphere. That's because greenhouse gases are trapping heat in the lower atmosphere.  Climate models that include solar irradiance changes can’t reproduce the observed temperature trend over the past century or more without including a rise in greenhouse gases.",The Causes of Climate Change,true
232,200462467340069812815018096410325351061,"Over the past two centuries, the times of day, locations and methods of measuring temperature have all changed dramatically. For example, where once researchers lowered buckets over the side of ships to collect water for measuring, we now have a global network of automated buoys floating around the oceans measuring the water directly.  This complicates matters for scientists putting together a long-term, consistent estimate of how global temperatures are changing. Scientists must adjust the raw data to take into account all the differences in how, when and where measurements were taken.  These adjustments have long been a heated point of debate. Many climate sceptics like to argue that scientists “exaggerate” warming by lowering past temperatures and raising present ones.  Christopher Booker, a climate sceptic writing in the Sunday Telegraph in 2015, called them “the greatest scientific scandal in history”. A new report from the rightwing US thinktank, the Cato Institute, even claims that adjustments account for “nearly all the warming” in the historical record.  But analysis by Carbon Brief comparing raw global temperature records to the adjusted data finds that the truth is much more mundane: adjustments have relatively little impact on global temperatures, particularly over the past 50 years.  In fact, over the full period when measurements are available, adjustments actually have the net effect of reducing the amount of long-term warming that the world has experienced.  Raw data shows more global warming  Land and ocean temperatures are adjusted separately to correct for changes to measurement methods over time. All the original temperature readings from both land-based weather stations and ocean-going ships and buoys are publically available and can be used to create a “raw” global temperature record.  The figure below shows the global surface temperature record created from only raw temperature readings with no adjustments applied (blue line). The red line is the adjusted land and ocean temperature record produced using adjusted data from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), with the difference between the two in grey.      Global mean adjusted and raw surface temperature. See note at the end for technical details on this analysis. Anomalies plotted with respect to a 1961-1990 baseline. Chart by Carbon Brief using Highcharts  You can see that adjustments to the data have relatively little effect on global temperatures after 1950. The rate of warming between 1950 and 2016 in the adjusted data is just under 10% faster than the raw data, and only 4% faster since the start of the modern warming period in 1970.  The adjustments that have a big impact on the surface temperature record all occur before 1950. Here, past temperatures are adjusted up – significantly reducing the warming over the past century. Over the full 1880-2016 period, the adjusted data actually warms more than 20% slower than the raw data. The large adjustments before 1950 are due almost entirely to changes in the way ships measured temperatures (more on that later).  Adjustments to land temperatures  So, looking at data adjustments more closely, why and how are land-based temperature measurements adjusted?  A single weather station will likely see many changes over the decades that it is in use. Few stations remain in exactly the same place over very long periods, with most stations experiencing at least one move to a new location. Most stations have also changed the way they measure temperatures, transitioning from liquid-in-glass thermometers to electronic instruments. Stations have often changed the time of day they measure temperatures, and growing cities and urban areas can introduce artificial warming in some stations. Very local factors, such as trees growing over stations or poor station siting, can also cause problems.  To correct for differences in a temperature record caused by these changes, known as inhomogeneities, scientists employ an approach known as statistical homogenization. They compare each station to all of its nearby neighbours and look for changes that are local to one station, but not found at any others in the area. Over long periods of time, climate changes are very rarely local, so localised changes not seen at surrounding stations are most likely due to something such as a station move or instrument change.  For example, if one station is warming over the course of a decade, while all the surrounding stations are cooling, that station would be flagged as “inhomogenous” and its record would be corrected to bring it back in line with its neighbours.  Disruptions of station records associated with station moves, time of observation changes, and even urbanisation tend to only affect one station in a region at a time, and can be easily picked up by neighbour comparisons.  The figure below shows the net effect of all the adjustments to land stations to the global land temperature record. Adjustments increase the overall land temperature warming by 16% between 1880 and 2016. Most of this is concentrated in the earlier part of the temperature record. Since 1970, adjustments only increase warming by 3%.  Adjustments to land temperatures do have larger effects in some particular regions – such as in the US and Africa – but these tend to average out when looking at the global land surface record.      Global adjusted and raw land temperatures. Anomalies plotted with respect to a 1961-1990 baseline. Chart by Carbon Brief using Highcharts  Scientists have gone to great lengths to test the methods they use to adjust land stations to ensure that they are accurately detecting and correcting problems without introducing spurious warming or cooling. This includes benchmarking studies – testing their approach on data with different types of errors added to it.  They have also set up a climate reference network in the US of perfectly sited stations with high-accuracy sensors. Comparing the raw and adjusted stations to this reference network, scientists have shown that the adjustments significantly improve the accuracy of the data.  While much has been made about adjustments to individual land stations that increase warming, these are often extreme cases cherry-picked to make a point. When adjustments to all stations are considered, just as many reduce warming as increase warming, as shown in the figure below from NOAA.  Here, roughly half of all corrections reduce the temperature and half increase it. For example, one station in Darwin, Australia has been adjusted to show more warming to account for a station move and shelter change in the 1940s. Yet the adjustment of another station – this time a station in Tokyo, Japan – has reduced the warming it shows to correct for the urban heat island effect of an expanding city.  Scientists have also worked to improve the number of land temperature records available to use by collecting and digitising old temperature records from around the world. New efforts such as the International Surface Temperature Initiative (ISTI) and the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature Project have worked to increase the number of historical land stations available by around 500%, compared to prior station collections, and provided better coverage of the Earth’s regions, as shown in the figure below.  Adjustments to ocean temperatures  Improvements to temperature measurements aren’t limited to the land – perhaps even more significant advances have come in how temperatures are measured in our oceans.  The biggest adjustment by far is the switch from bucket-based measurements to engine intakes in ships in the 1930s and 1940s. This is the “only one that matters” globally, says Maynooth University researcher Dr Peter Thorne, who has worked with NOAA to develop their ocean temperature record.  Prior to 1940, most ships measured temperatures by throwing a bucket overboard into the water, pulling it up onto the deck by rope, and sticking a thermometer in the bucket to measure the temperature of the water. The problem is that air temperatures are often much warmer or colder than ocean temperatures. As the bucket is slowly pulled up onto deck, the water will heat up or cool down.  During the 1930s and 1940s, most ships switched to measuring temperatures through engine room intakes. Ships pull seawater in through the hull to cool the engine and the temperature of the water was taken as it came in. This resulted in temperature readings quite a bit different than when using buckets, since – despite the fact that engine rooms are warm – the water had little time to warm up or cool down before being measured.  The raw and adjusted ocean temperature records are shown in the figure below, with the bucket adjustments quite prominent at around 0.3C.      Global adjusted and raw sea surface temperatures. Anomalies plotted with respect to a 1961-1990 baseline. Chart by Carbon Brief using Highcharts  The large pre-1940 bucket adjustments greatly reduce the long-term warming in the record, resulting in 36% less warming since 1880 than in the raw temperature data. In recent years, adjustments to ocean temperatures slightly increase the rate of warming by around 4%.  Since 1990, the way that oceans temperatures are measured has changed once again. While about 90% of measurements came from ships 20 years ago, today almost 80% come from buoys floating in the ocean. These buoys are in direct contact with the water and end up reading temperatures slightly lower than measurements taken in engine room intakes.  To correct for a cool bias introduced by adding cooler buoy data to warmer ship data, temperatures are adjusted slightly upwards for recent years. This fact proved quite controversial with the publication of a paper by Tom Karl and colleagues in 2015, but has since been validated by other studies. The net effect of these buoy-related adjustments, however, is relatively small.  Records from many different groups  It’s also worth noting that adjustments to temperature records are not decided by one single group of scientists. Rather, multiple different research teams have independently created their own land and ocean temperature records.  While much of the underlying raw data is the same, each takes a somewhat different approach to adjustments and how to deal with areas of the earth with missing data. The resulting global temperature records from five different groups, along with the raw data, are shown in the figure below.      Global mean surface temperatures from NASA Berkeley Earth , and Cowtan and Way . Anomalies plotted with respect to a 1961-1990 baseline. Chart by Carbon Brief using Highcharts  NOAA and NASA share the same adjustment approach for land and oceans, though NASA applies an additional correction for urban heat islands that gives stations in cities less weight. The record jointly produced by the UK Met Office Hadley Centre and the University of East Anglia’s Climatic Research Unit has its own approach of relying mostly on national meteorological offices to adjust the data within their own countries. It also has its own separate ocean temperature record with its own adjustment approach. The temperature record by researchers Cowtan and Way simply use Hadley data with a different approach for areas with missing data, such as the polar regions.  The Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature project, which was founded as an independent non-governmental group to independently assess surface temperature records, has its own unique approach for adjusting land records. This detects problems at local stations and cuts the station record at the point where the problem is found. Everything after that point is considered to be a new station. For sea surface temperatures, Berkeley uses Hadley’s adjusted ocean record.  Changing versions of temperature datasets  Those sceptical of temperature adjustments have often tried to show their impact by comparing older and newer versions of the same temperature record. The problem with this approach is that it risks conflating changes in data availability, methodology and adjustments.  However, even if different versions of prior records are compared, the changes over time between records are generally relatively small. The charts below show different versions of the NASA and Hadley/UEA datasets published over the past 30 years.      5-year running mean comparisons of past and current versions of the Hadley/UEA record (top) and NASA record (bottom). Anomalies plotted with respect to a 1961-1990 baseline. Chart by Carbon Brief using Highcharts  Subsequent updates to datasets after the mid-1990s are actually quite small and mostly reflect factors such as increased station data availability in the Arctic and recent adjustments such as the ship-buoy transition corrections. It’s only when you compare them to global temperature estimates from the 1980s that larger differences emerge.  This is because early 1980s estimates of global temperatures had much less data to work with. Scientists had yet to undertake the painstaking work of collecting and digitising much of the world’s temperature records from paper logbooks.  In 1981, for example, NASA relied on only a few hundred land stations almost entirely in the Northern Hemisphere to estimate global temperatures. Their temperature record did not even use any sea surface temperature data until the 1990s. Today, scientists have collected records from more than 32,000 land stations and more than 1.2m observations of sea surface temperatures per year.  Both the number of stations included and the methodology used by global surface temperature datasets have changed over time. Rather than compare different versions of existing datasets, it is much simpler to analyse all the raw temperature records available today and compare them to the adjusted data. This lets scientists isolate just the effect of the adjustments.  Conclusion  With almost 200 years of raw data to work with, adjustments are a necessary part of the methodology for scientists constructing long-term global temperature records. But most of these adjustments are small and they have relatively little impact on temperature records over the past few decades.  The most significant account for the shift from buckets to ship intakes in ocean temperature records in the 1930s and 1940s, and these changes are well-understood by scientists. And, contrary to popular belief, adjustments actually reduce, rather than increase, the amount of warming experienced globally over the past century.  Methodological footnote  The global, land and ocean temperature records from raw and adjusted data shown in the article were constructed as follows:  Land: Both raw and adjusted land temperature data was obtained from the Global Historical Climatological Network Monthly Version 4. Stations records were converted into anomalies with respect to a 1961-1990 baseline period. Stations with fewer than 10 years overlap with the baseline period were discarded. Stations were assigned to 5×5 latitude/longitude grid cells. Anomalies for each month were averaged within each grid cell. A global land temperature estimate was calculated by an area-weighted average of grid cells for each month.  Ocean: Raw ocean temperature records from ships and buoys are available from ICOADS. For this analysis, an unadjusted gridded product provided by HadSST3 was used. Adjusted ocean temperature records were taken from the ERSSTv4 gridded product.  Global: Global land/ocean temperatures were estimated by weighted combination of land and ocean temperature, with weights of 0.71 for ocean and 0.29 for land representing their relative portion of the Earth’s surface.

The NCS, however, said that the procurement of three mobile scanners for it by the Ministry of Finance would further enhance its surveillance and security at the country’s borders.  Col. Hameed Ali, retired, the Comptroller General, NCS, said this at the presentation of the service’s 2021 budget before the House Committee on Customs Service on Thursday in Abuja.  The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the NCS proposed a budget of N242.45 billion for the 2021 fiscal year.  Ali said that there was no way the NCS, which has a little over 15,000 officers, would be able to police the nation’s boarders effectively.  The CGC said that it was worrisome that smuggling often happened in border communities where most of the residents had no feel of governance and therefore bare no allegiance to the Nigerian government.  He said that those residents would rather bare their allegiance to smugglers because of lack of government presence in the border communities, stressing that the NCS would continue to do its best to police the nation’s borders.  “I feel their pain, in some cases they have to cross the border to go to school and also fetch water because there is no government presence,” the CGC said.  He said that the war against smugglers should not be left to the NCS alone, adding that other security agencies should be involved in the fight against smuggling.  Ali also disclosed that the three scanners purchased would be deployed to Apapa, Tin can Island and Port Harcourt, adding that the scanner would be use to improve its work.  On recruitment into the NCS, the CGC said that the service had not recruited in the past 17 years, adding that recruitment into the service was the prerogative of the President.  He said that the NCS needed to recruit officers, adding that there was a gap in terms of officers currently in the service.  “There will come a time that there will be no junior officers again in NCS; we need more officers and this is why we embarked on the recruitment of 3200 officers for which we have so far spent N40 million,” he said.  Rep Leke Abejide, the Chairman of the committee, said that the committee was interested in the 2020 NCS budget performance as it was one of the major agencies of revenue generation in the country.","NCS says Nigeria border area extensive, porous | The Guardian Nigeria News - Nigeria and World News",true

According to the corporation, the decision to seize Senator Buhari’s assets was sequel to the order of Justice I. E Ekwo of the Federal High Court, Abuja.  Some of the assets seized by AMCON include: a property at 12, St, Petersburg Street, Wuse II, Abuja and Plot 516 off Misau Crescent, off Birnin Kebbi Crescent, Garki II, Abuja.

Babatunde Oduyoye, who is currently serving as his Special Adviser on Strategy and Political Matters, as a unifier.  The governor gave the commendation while speaking at the Annual Birthday Lecture Series in commemoration of the birthday of the former Minority Whip of the House of Representatives and a two-term member of the House, Hon. (Chief) Babatunde Oduyoye, at Oritsejolomi Hall, International Conference Centre, University of Ibadan.  The lecture, with the topic: ‘Security and National Unity in Difficult Times’ was delivered by the chairman of the Nigerian Governors’ Forum (NGF) and governor of Ekiti State, Dr. Kayode Fayemi.  He equally commended the celebrant for always demonstrating a commitment to any course he believes in to the point of success, adding that, as a governor, he has won many political battles with the intervention of Oduyoye.  “Well, we have all listened to the lecture, which was given by a Ph.D. holder in war studies. But I only have one or two things to say about today’s celebrant, Hon Babatunde Oduyoye. Governor Fayemi said he is a good man. Yes, He is.  “And one thing I can say about Hon Babatunde Oduyoye is, He is a unifier. In this gathering, I have seen members of the APC and PDP. I can also see members of the aggrieved PDP. Also, I can see some members of progressives (Afenifere). So, He is a unifier.  “In 2015, I contested to be the governor and lost. I was going around to see where I was not doing things right and then a very close brother of mine told me that I did not look for a unifier and that was why I lost the election. So, he took me to Hon. Oduyoye. And when I got to him, he said I failed because all other governorship candidates came to meet him and I did not come. And I said, going forward, we will work together. And from that point forward, he demonstrated commitment.  “And I can tell you that he flew outside the country on my behalf to go have a former governor to accept me into the fold and, at the end, of the day, God took control.  “If Hon. Oduyoye makes any commitment, you can rest assured that he will follow through. So, I did not have any problem after I was sworn in as the governor and I had to appoint him as my Special Adviser and Politics and Strategy. He has been doing some talking behind the scene.  “Today, I am happy to be here for this lecture series. I pray that many more will come. And I am using you as a point of contact for Nigeria and all the October 1st celebrants. I wish all of you many more years of fruitful service to our state, our country in good health.”  The Babatunde Oduyoye Annual Birthday Lecture Series is a platform for discussion of critical national issues and proffering solutions to contemporary national existential challenges.

236,65454706643708193448812530100053385914,"The Public Prosecution Service (PPS) has today issued a decision to prosecute a former soldier, identified as Soldier B, for the offence of murder in relation to the death of a teenage boy in 1972, and for a charge of wounding with intent in respect of a second youth.    Fifteen-year-old Daniel Hegarty was shot and killed by a member of an Army patrol on duty in the Creggan area of Londonderry on 31 July 1972, during what was known as ‘Operation Motorman’.    Daniel died after being shot twice in the head by Soldier B. His cousin Christopher Hegarty, then aged 17, was also shot and injured in the incident.    The Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland, Stephen Herron, met with members of the Hegarty family to inform them of the decision at a private meeting in Derry today (Monday April 15, 2019).    Speaking afterwards, the Director said: “Following the ruling of the Divisional Court last year I conducted a review of this case.    “I have given careful consideration to all of the available evidence. This has included material obtained in the course of the initial investigation; by a later investigation carried out by the Historical Enquiries Team; material generated by Inquest proceedings and a number of expert forensic reports, the most recent of which was provided after the Court ruling in 2018.    “I have concluded that the evidence which can be presented at court is sufficient to provide a reasonable prospect of conviction and that the Evidential Test for Prosecution is met.    “As with all cases, I have also carefully considered whether the public interest requires prosecution through the courts. Particular consideration was given to Soldier B’s ill health, regarding which an updated medical report was obtained. In line with our Code for Prosecutors, I have concluded, given the seriousness of the charges, that the Public Interest Test for Prosecution is also met.    “I have therefore taken the decision to prosecute an individual identified as Soldier B for the offence of murder in relation to the death of Daniel Hegarty and for the wounding of Christopher Hegarty.    “This decision has been reached following an objective and impartial application of the Test for Prosecution which was conducted in accordance with the Code for Prosecutors and with the benefit of advice from Senior Counsel.”  Notes to Editors  Section 1 – reporting restrictions:    1. As a prosecution will shortly be commenced, the PPS does not intend to make any further comment on this case at this point.  2. The PPS would remind the media and the public that there should be no reporting, commentary or online sharing of information which could in any way prejudice these proceedings.  3. Soldier B’s anonymity should be maintained until the issue has been formally ruled upon by the court.  Section 2 – useful references:  4. All decisions by the PPS are taken strictly in accordance with the Test for Prosecution which involves two stages. The Test for Prosecution is met if, in relation to an identifiable suspect, the available evidence is sufficient to provide a reasonable prospect of a conviction (the Evidential Test) and if prosecution is in the public interest (the Public Interest Test). The Evidential Test must be passed first before the Public Interest Test is considered. Further information can be found in the PPS Code for Prosecutors. The PPS takes all of its decisions in accordance with the Code for Prosecutors, which can be found here.  5. What is a review? The PPS Code for Prosecutors allows for a review of a decision not to prosecute, for example, where new evidence or information becomes available or a specific request is made by a person, such as a Coroner or a victim.  A review involves the fresh application of the Test for Prosecution. If there is new or additional evidence this can be done by the Prosecutor who took the previous no prosecution decision. If there is no new or additional evidence a different Prosecutor who had no role in the original decision will conduct the review.  6. Decisions not to prosecute in this case were previously taken in 1973, in 2008 following a review of the case by the PSNI Historical Enquiries Team, and in 2016 following a referral by the Coroner. The 2016 decision not to prosecute was quashed by the Divisional Court in 2018 and a further review was conducted which resulted in the decisions to prosecute that have been announced today.    Section 3 – Legacy cases:  7. Cases where a prosecution decision has been taken.  We have identified 26 cases involving a large number of suspects which can be described as “legacy” in which the PPS has taken prosecutorial decisions since 2011.    Half of all such cases (13) relate to alleged offences involving republican paramilitaries and there have been prosecutions in eight of these. Proceedings are still active in three of these cases. Of the five concluded cases, there were two convictions and two in which proceedings were discontinued, one following the death of the defendant. There was also one acquittal.    Eight of the 26 cases related to alleged loyalist paramilitary activity. There were decisions to prosecute in four of these cases. Convictions have been secured in two cases while two others are currently active.    A further five cases involved a number of former soldiers (22). This has resulted in a decision to prosecute six individuals for a range of serious offences.    The final two cases involved police officers and both resulted in a decision not to prosecute.",Former Soldier to be prosecuted for death of teenager in 1972,true
237,110580932673915187547087205897128453203,"Households in Britain will be hit by a cost of living jump in April larger than anything seen since the 2008-09 financial crisis — and possibly worse than anything seen in a generation, according to experts in household finances.  The combination of extreme rises in household gas and electricity bills, likely to be more than 50 per cent in April, large national insurance and income tax rises on top of the highest rate of general price increases for a decade will put serious strains on family budgets, with the poorest households hit hardest.  Martin Lewis, founder of Money Saving Expert, said the coming gas and electricity price rises were “a nightmare that’ll throw millions into fuel poverty”.  Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said: “The combination of substantial tax increases and big increases in prices, particularly energy prices, will be a larger shock for households on average earnings than anything at least since the financial crisis and possibly for a long time before that.”  Coming just weeks before the May local elections, the looming income hit is causing severe political difficulty for Boris Johnson’s government, with Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the House of Commons, this week pressing the prime minister to scrap the £12bn planned increase in national insurance bills.  But scrapping the rise would only mitigate, not eliminate, the sharp squeeze in household incomes, which has three elements.  Energy price rises  Households have so far been protected from the increase in wholesale energy prices by the government cap on bills, but this will be lifted in April. Most estimates suggest the cap will need to rise by more than 50 per cent if the government does not intervene to lower the level of bills.  Calculations from Investec suggest the price cap will rise by 56 per cent in April, pushing the typical energy bill from £1,277 to just shy of £2,000 a year.  This has the largest effect on poorer families because they tend to spend a larger proportion of their income on essentials. Figures from the Office for National Statistics show that 7.1 per cent of spending among the poorest tenth of households goes to electricity and gas compared with 3.9 per cent for the richest tenth of households.  The looming rises in energy prices have a huge effect on discretionary spending power, after households have paid their rent or mortgages, food bills and utilities such as water. Financial Times calculations show that the rise would reduce family discretionary spending by nearly 7 per cent for the poorest households, almost 4 per cent for people in the middle of the income scale and 2 per cent for the richest.  These sorts of sudden income hits have not been seen in the UK at any time in recent years, leading to what Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation think-tank, has called “an overnight cost of living catastrophe”.  Tax increases  Price rises will be compounded by two big personal tax increases planned to hit households at exactly the same time in April.  First, the rate of employee national insurance will rise by 1.25 percentage points, reducing most pay packets. Employers are unlikely to compensate their staff for this extra tax, and might well limit pay rises because they will face their own 1.25 percentage point increase at the same time.  The combined employer and employee tax rises are expected to raise £12.7bn next year, an average hit of a little over £400 for each of the UK’s 29.4m employees.  On top of the national insurance rises, all income tax thresholds and allowances are to be frozen, increasing the tax charged when people’s income rises. The Treasury estimated at the time of the March Budget that the threshold freeze would bring in at least £1.6bn in 2022-23.  In total, these tax increases will hit higher-income households harder, as a greater proportion of them are in work.  Rise in inflation  The energy price rises and tax increases will come at a time when prices are already rising faster than at any time in the past decade.  Consumer price inflation stood at 5.1 per cent in November and economists at Goldman Sachs expect prices to be 6.8 per cent higher in April than a year earlier, even if the government offsets the jump in gas and electricity bills.  This rise in prices is considerably higher than the increase in average earnings, pensions or the minimum wage, which is scheduled to go up by 6.6 per cent in April.  Even before it became clear that prices were likely to rise much faster than wages, the Office for Budget Responsibility, the spending watchdog, was forecasting a squeeze in real incomes this year. The Resolution Foundation now expects the income squeeze to last through 2022 with little prospect of relief in 2023.",UK households face biggest income squeeze in a generation,true

We said this would only remain the case for the shortest period necessary while case rates had risen steeply due to the Omicron variant of COVID-19.  In light of falling case rates, we have now reviewed the evidence and confirmed that face coverings in classrooms in schools and colleges are no longer required from Thursday 20 January, and face coverings in communal areas are likewise no longer required from Thursday 27 January. Here we provide an update on what you need to know.  What have you announced?  The confirmation that face coverings no longer need to be worn in classrooms from Thursday 20 January, or in communal areas of schools and colleges from Thursday 27 January.  This decision comes in response to national infection data showing the prevalence of COVID-19 is on a downward trajectory.  Are there any circumstances where I still might need to wear a mask?  Local directors of public health are able to recommend the use of face coverings in communal areas—across their area only—where DfE and public health experts judge the measure to be proportionate due to specific health concerns. This is a temporary measure.  Directors of public health will also continue to advise individual settings experiencing outbreaks. Any local introduction of face coverings will be subject to routine review and removed at the earliest opportunity.  Do pupils, families and staff still have to take regular COVID tests and get vaccinated?  Yes, we recommend that all pupils, their families and school, college and early years staff should test twice weekly. This ensures even instances where people have the virus but show no symptoms are picked up and able to isolate to stop the spread of the virus.  It is also important that all those eligible get a vaccine or booster.

239,35726767673806851858499389216096243775,"Dan Owen HMI, Specialist Adviser for school inspection policy, discusses how inspectors evaluate off-rolling on school inspections.  Off-rolling has received a lot of interest from the press and among school leaders and teachers recently. But as Ofsted-commissioned research published today suggests, different people have different definitions of what off-rolling is. At times this leads to confusion.  While there’s no legal definition of off-rolling, our definition within Ofsted is very simple.  Off-rolling is the practice of removing a pupil from the school roll without using a permanent exclusion, when the removal is primarily in the best interests of the school, rather than the the best interests of the pupil. This includes pressuring a parent to remove their child from the school roll.  While it may not always be unlawful, Ofsted believes off-rolling is never acceptable.  What doesn’t constitute off-rolling  There are many reasons pupils leave school. They might move house, leave the country, or move to another, closer school when a place becomes available. Of course, none of these things is off-rolling.  Other pupils might leave to be home educated. Again, where this is a parent’s clear choice, without pressure from the school, it is not off-rolling.  Dual-registering a pupil with another school such as an alternative provider is also not off-rolling. This is because the pupil has not left the roll of their school. The statutory guidance on alternative provision makes it clear that pupils should be dual-registered if they are attending AP.  ‘Managed moves’ from one school to another as an alternative to exclusion can sometimes be effective in breaking the cycle of poor pupil behaviour. If these moves are used in pupils’ best interests, with the agreement of everyone involved within the statutory guidance, then again, this is not off-rolling.  Some pupils are permanently excluded. But as long as headteachers have followed the relevant legislation and statutory guidance, this is not off-rolling. Schools must be able to exclude pupils where necessary, and we support schools using exclusions as part of their behaviour policy and as a last resort.  What are examples of off-rolling and how do we spot it?  Before an inspection, Ofsted’s analysts give the lead inspector information about whether or not a school has exceptional levels of pupils leaving the school in years 10 and 11. Of course, this doesn’t always mean that off-rolling is happening. But it makes sure that inspectors explore this possibility during the inspection.  We know that disadvantaged pupils, those with special educational needs, and pupils with low prior attainment are disproportionately removed from the school roll. Inspectors will ask leaders about who has left and why. Are there any patterns in the groups who leave? How do they support pupils from these groups who are still in the school? For example, if most of the pupils who left have special educational needs and/or disabilities, how does the school cater for this group? Have they reviewed their provision and improved it if necessary?  If a school uses managed moves, inspectors may ask to see evidence of how these meet the statutory guidance. Again, if these moves are happening during years 10 and 11, inspectors will look closely at whether this decision is in the best interests of the pupils in question.  As our report shows, some schools, sadly, pressure families to take their children out of school to avoid an exclusion – many parents simply do not want a permanent exclusion on their child’s record. This is a clear example of off-rolling and is never acceptable, as the statutory guidance on exclusions makes clear. Exclusions rightly go through a robust process to make sure that they are justified. Avoiding this is not fair to pupils or parents.  How does Ofsted play a part in tackling off-rolling?  Ofsted puts children’s welfare and their quality of education first, so it is right that inspectors explore pupils leaving the roll. Whenever we uncover off-rolling, we set this out in the published inspection report. And under our new framework which takes effect later this year, any schools that are off-rolling are likely to be judged inadequate for leadership and management.  As recent, high-profile inspections have shown, off-rolling is not a black-and-white issue, and inspectors will need to gather evidence on inspection to see what is really happening. We know that very often there will be a good and positive explanation for why pupils have moved, and we will accept this.  We believe that the vast majority of schools always make decisions in the very best interests of pupils. However, if pupils are leaving a school to serve the school’s interests, not their own, we will identify this and report on it wherever we find it.","What is off-rolling, and how does Ofsted look at it on inspection?",true

Unfortunately some of the formatting has been unavoidably altered, but not the text itself.  R v MILO PONSFORD, SAGE WILLOUGHBY, RHIAN GRAHAM & JAKE SKUSE  LEGAL DIRECTIONS – JUDGE’S HANDOUT  My jobs –  To explain to you the law which applies in this case.  I am responsible for decisions about what legal rules you have to follow.  All of my directions about the law, set out in this document, are compulsory for you to follow – you have no choice. If I get them wrong they can be corrected by an appeal.  To remind you of the core parts of the evidence to help you remember what witnesses have said, but you are the assessors of the evidence, not me. I will do that after you have heard the closing speeches of the advocates in the case.  Your jobs –  Appoint someone to chair your discussions. Choose someone in any way you want. That person should ensure everyone is given the opportunity of expressing their views and everyone listens respectfully to each other. The person you choose to chair your discussions doesn’t have any special status – you are all equally important – you each have one vote. When you have made up your minds one of you will need to act as your spokesperson and answer a series of questions from the court clerk to tell us what verdicts you have reached.  Make the necessary decisions about the facts of this case, as a group of the 12 of you together, in order to come to your agreed verdicts of either ‘guilty’ or ‘not guilty’. Here are some guidelines about how to approach your task  Assess what witnesses have said and assess the other material placed before you so as to decide what facts have been proved.  You are the only judges of the evidence.  Throughout your discussions as a jury you have to decide on the facts of the case. That’s not for me, nor anyone else.  Respect each others’ opinions and value the different viewpoints you each bring to the case.  Be fair and give everyone a chance to speak.  It is okay to change your mind.  Listen to one another.  Do not be afraid to speak up and express your views  Do not let yourself be pressured into changing your opinion, and do not pressure anyone else.  Do not rush into a verdict to save time. Everyone involved in this case deserves your attention and thoughtful consideration.  Do not under any circumstances make your own inquiries about anything to do with the case (as explained in the handout “Your Legal Responsibilities as a Juror” that you received on the first day of the trial).  If someone is not following the instructions in this document, or refuses to engage, or relies on other information outside of the evidence presented to you then you must let me know by sending me a note straight away.  You can vote on where you have all got to in your views at any stage of your discussions.  You can take votes by raising your hands or by writing it down – that is up to you.  Your verdicts have to be unanimous: 12-0 decisions. (If the time were to come when I could accept any verdict from you involving fewer votes than 12 in favour of it you must wait until I call you back into court and tell you about it.)  Who has the job of proving the facts of the case?  The Prosecution has brought the case to court, so  the Prosecution has the burden of proving its allegations.  A Defendant does not have to prove anything or disprove anything.  How is something ‘proved’?  Something is proved if, and only if, you are sure about it in the light of all of the evidence you have heard on that topic.  If, in the light of all of the evidence on that topic, you are not sure about it, then it hasn’t been proved.  Separate verdicts  There are four Defendants and so there are four verdicts of ‘guilty’ or ‘not guilty’ you have to reach.  You must examine the evidence in relation to each Defendant – one by one, reaching a separate verdict on each, based upon your analysis of the evidence against each of them.  Your verdicts may well all be the same, but they might be different.  It all depends on your view of the evidence against each.  What is it that has to be proved by the Prosecution for ‘Criminal Damage’?  The indictment charges contain a number of separate ingredients, all of which the Prosecution must prove before you can convict a Defendant.  The Prosecution has to prove all of the following against a Defendant (D) before you may find him/her guilty of causing criminal damage:-  1) D, jointly and together with others  2) damaged property;  3) the property belonged to another;  4) D intended to damage it, or was reckless as to whether it would be damaged; and  5) D did not have a lawful excuse for damaging it.  We are going to examine each of those five ingredients in a little more detail:-  The prosecution alleges that the Defendants acted “jointly and together with others”.  The law is that a person may be guilty of a crime either by carrying it out themselves, or, if they intended that the crime should be committed, by deliberately assisting or encouraging or causing it to be committed, even if it is actually carried out by others.  A Defendant in this case may therefore be guilty, even if they did not personally cause damage to the statue, if they deliberately assisted/encouraged/caused others to damage it by providing ropes or by attaching ropes to the statue, intending to assist others to intentionally or recklessly cause damage to the statue.  2. Property is “damaged” if it is temporarily or permanently physically harmed. Whether you are sure there was physical harm to the statue or not (which is a question of fact and degree) is a question for you to decide on the evidence which you have heard.  3. Property is to be treated as “belonging” to those who have custody or control of it and to those who have any proprietary right or interest in it. The Prosecution case is that the statue was maintained by Bristol City Council and held in trust on behalf of the people of Bristol. The Defendants have not suggested that the statue belonged exclusively to one or more of them – they do not dispute that it “belonged to another”.  4. “Intending to damage the statue, or being reckless as to whether it would be damaged.” ‘Intending’ is a straightforward word which needs no further definition.  D would have acted ‘recklessly’ as to whether the statue was damaged if D was aware of a risk that damage would occur and it was, in the circumstances known to D, unreasonable to take the risk. If D was unaware of a risk that damage would occur then D could not have been reckless.  5. It is for the Prosecution to disprove that a Defendant had a “lawful excuse” for damaging someone else’s property.  In this case it is being argued that a D had one (or more) lawful excuses.  You will have to examine the lawful excuses set out below and decide if the Prosecution has disproved them.  The use of reasonable force to prevent a crime.  A person is to be treated as having a lawful excuse if:-  (1) they used such force as was reasonable in the circumstances as they believed them to be  (2) in the prevention of a crime.  (3) When they gave evidence you may consider that the Ds were saying they used force to prevent the following crimes:  the public display of indecent matter  the display of a visible representation which is abusive, within the sight of a person likely to be caused distress by it.  I will explain a little more about each of those three parts of this lawful excuse which is relied upon by the Defendants, but I will do so in reverse order: (3), (2) & then (1), because that will make it easier to understand.  May D have genuinely/honestly believed that a factual situation existed which amounts to a criminal offence (even if D’s belief was a mistaken one)?  There is a criminal offence of displaying indecent matter publicly.  May D have genuinely/honestly believed Bristol City Council was displaying ‘indecent matter’ in public with this statue on the Centre?  The definition of ‘indecent’ in the Oxford English Dictionary includes:  “unbecoming; highly unsuitable or inappropriate; in extremely bad taste; unseemly; offending against the recognized standards of propriety and delicacy; highly indelicate…”  There is a criminal offence of displaying a visible representation which is abusive, within the sight of a person likely to be caused distress by it.  May D have genuinely/honestly believed that Bristol City Council was committing that crime by displaying an abusive statue, where one or more people were likely to have been caused distress by it?  The Defence argue that they genuinely/honestly believed that a factual situation existed which amounts to these criminal offences being committed by the Council.  The Prosecution argues that no criminal offence was being committed at all by the display of this statue – it was neither ‘indecent’ nor ‘abusive’, and you can be sure that the Ds did not genuinely/honestly believe a factual situation existed which would have amounted to these crimes.  If you decide that D may have genuinely/honestly believed that a factual situation existed which amounts to these criminal offences, you need to go on to examine the following.  (2) Were D’s actions carried out in order to prevent what they honestly/genuinely (even if mistakenly) believed to be a crime?  The Defendants argue that that is what they were doing – their actions were done in order to prevent one or both of those crimes, which they honestly/genuinely believed to be happening.  The Prosecution argues that they were not trying to achieve that, but instead were trying to force their own agenda because they were frustrated by the lack of progress in the debate about the statue.  Did D use ‘reasonable’ force to prevent a crime, in the circumstances as they believed them to be?  It is for you to decide what force was reasonable by your own standards. It is not what D thinks was reasonable – it’s what you think was reasonable.  However, the ‘circumstances’ in which force was used are the circumstances as D believed them to be.  If D only did what they honestly and instinctively thought was necessary to prevent a crime, then that would be strong evidence that reasonable action was taken.  In the case of the first 3 Defendants, did each of them honestly and instinctively think it was necessary to play a part in pulling down the statue to prevent a crime?  In the case of the fourth Defendant, did he honestly and instinctively think it was necessary to help roll the statue all the way to Pero’s bridge to prevent a crime?  The Prosecution says that even if you were to conclude Bristol City Council may have been committing one or both of the crimes now alleged (which is disputed), and even if you were to conclude the Defendants honestly (even if mistakenly) took the action they did to prevent one or more of those crimes,  it was unreasonable, in the circumstances as Ds believed them to be, to use force like this to prevent it, because there was a process through which concerns about the statue could have been dealt.  The Defendants argue that their actions were reasonable because any such processes had failed.  (ii) Belief in the consent of the owners  A person is to be treated as having a lawful excuse if he/she honestly believed,  at the time of the acts alleged to constitute the offence,  that those who the person honestly believed were entitled to consent to the damage,  would have consented to it,  if they had known of the damage and its circumstances.  (It does not matter if the person’s beliefs were justified or not, as long as they were honestly held.)  Neither Milo Ponsford nor Sage Willoughby have presented evidence that could form the basis of an argument that they had this lawful excuse.  Rhian Graham and Jake Skuse have given evidence to the effect that they had this lawful excuse for their actions, saying that on 7 June 2020 they honestly believed the statue was owned by the people of Bristol and honestly believed that, had the people of Bristol known of the damage and its circumstances, they would have consented to what was done.  The Prosecution argues that there is no way that they could possibly have honestly believed that the people of Bristol would have consented to what they did because they didn’t take any steps to find out.  If you consider that this lawful excuse applied, or may have applied, in the case of either of those two Defendants, then the Prosecution would have failed to disprove it and you will find that Defendant ‘not guilty’.  (iii) The final lawful excuse you have to consider concerns all four defendants (and, again, the Prosecution has the burden of disproving it). However, I am going to deal with it under a separate bold heading:-  Would convicting D be a disproportionate interference with his/her rights?  Courts must read and give effect to legislation such as the Criminal Damage Act in a manner which is compatible with a number of rights which we all have.  Two of those rights are:  the right to freedom of thought and conscience and to manifest one’s beliefs;  the right to freedom of expression, including to hold opinions and impart ideas.  These rights protect not only beliefs, such as anti-racism, and speech itself, but also actions associated with protest. Even where those actions have more than a minimal impact on the rights of other people, they need not result in a conviction. It is all a matter of fact and degree.  Limitations on these rights are permitted under laws like the Criminal Damage Act if they are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of public safety or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.  It requires balancing the defendants’ rights to freedom of conscience and belief, to freedom of expression and to protest, as against the interests of public safety and the protection of the rights and freedoms of others, such as the property rights of the Council.  The Ds will argue that even if you reject all of their other arguments, if you were to convict them it would be a disproportionate interference with them exercising those rights.  You will therefore have to decide if the Prosecution made you sure that convicting them of criminal damage would be a proportionate interference with them exercising those rights.  Even if you are sure that all the other elements of the crime of criminal damage are made out and that no other lawful excuse applies, you must go on to consider whether it is necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of public safety or for the protection of the rights of others, that the defendants should be convicted for their actions.  Another way of looking at that question is to ask whether the interference in the defendants’ rights, which a conviction for the offence of criminal damage would cause, is proportionate in all the circumstances, including the individual actions of each D.  It is your task to make an assessment of where the balance lies, having regard to all the facts in the case.  In considering whether a conviction would be disproportionate for any D, the question for you is not whether you agree with their actions or their aims, nor is it about sympathy or whether you think they are likeable. Everyone in the country has these rights and we each enjoy identical protection of those rights. This means that people with whom we fundamentally disagree have exactly the same protection as those with whom we agree.  When examining the facts of this case and deciding whether you are sure it would be proportionate to convict a Defendant, you may wish to consider the following factors. The list is not intended to be exhaustive and you are not obliged to consider any individual factor if you do not consider it to be helpful in reaching your verdict. It is also up to you what weight to give the factors you consider helpful.  The extent of the interference with the rights of others, notably the rights of Bristol City Council and of other Bristolians on whose behalf they held this statue in trust.  Whether the Defendant believed in the views which motivated their actions.  Whether those views relate to very important issues.  The importance to the Defendant of the method of protest adopted.  Whether the actions of the Defendant was directly aimed at the matter of which they disapproved.  Whether the Defendant’s actions presented a danger to public safety.  ‘No comment’ interviews  The words of the police ‘caution’ are: “You do not have to say anything.  But, it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something which you later rely on in court. Anything you do say may be given in evidence.”  As it says, it is a suspect’s right not to answer police questions, but there is also a warning that there might be damaging consequences if they do not mention something when questioned which they later rely on in court.  Two of the accused – Milo Ponsford and Jake Skuse, declined to answer any police questions.  When the Prosecution asked Milo Ponsford and Jake Skuse why, they both told you they acted on the basis of advice from a Solicitor’s representative.  They each acknowledged it was their own choice to decide whether or not to answer the police questions and face any consequences from a decision not to. They do not accept that the real reason behind their decisions not to answer questions was because they had not yet had time to think up answers which might provide them with the basis of a defence that they might be able to rely upon if they were charged with criminal damage.  They have now given you detailed accounts from the witness box. I will summarise their evidence in due course, but they were both asked: whether they had any lawful excuse for damaging it. Both replied “no comment”. They have now put forward accounts from the witness box, during the course of which they have said they did have lawful excuses for what they did.  Could they have reasonably been expected to set out what lawful excuses they now rely upon to the police when asked about the allegation in their interviews back in 2020? Why didn’t they answer the questions with the answers they have now given to you in court?  You must consider their explanations for that. They have each told you the real reason was because they took the advice they were given by a legal adviser. If you accept that may have been the real reason behind their decision to remain silent, then take this matter no further, don’t hold it against them.  However, if you are sure that the real reason for keeping silent was that that Defendant didn’t have an answer to those questions and was giving himself time to make-up answers later to support a defence to the allegation, then you are entitled to hold their silence at the police station against them and treat the things they have said from the witness box as having less weight.  You should only reach that conclusion if the prosecution case was so strong as to call for an answer and you think it is fair and proper to do so. You must not convict that defendant wholly, or mainly, on the basis of this point – it is just one of the factors which may feature in your assessment of all of the evidence in the case.  Sage Willoughby and Rhian Graham, on the other hand, answered many of the police questions and explained what motivated their actions. Do not hold it against them that they did not answer some police questions, because those questions have no bearing upon your assessment of whether they are guilty or whether any of the others are guilty.  Expert evidence  In this case you have heard the evidence of Professor Olusoga, who has been called on behalf of Sage Willoughby. Expert evidence is permitted in a criminal trial to provide you with information and opinion, within the witnesses expertise, which is likely to be outside your knowledge. You should look at it in its proper perspective – it is just part of the evidence as a whole to which you may have regard on one particular aspect of the case, namely if you think it helps you assess the question of whether displaying a monument of Edward Colston may be indecent or abusive. You are entitled to have regard to the historical information he has researched and interpreted when coming to your own conclusions. Bear in mind, however, that if, having given the matter careful consideration, you do not accept any parts of his evidence, or do not think it helps you answer the questions you have to answer, then you do not have to act upon it. It is for you to decide what evidence you consider relevant, what evidence you accept and what evidence you reject.  The relevance of the first three Defendants having no previous convictions  You should consider this in 2 different ways:  a) It is relevant to your assessment of their credibility as witnesses. Someone with previous criminal convictions might be considered less likely to be a truthful witness. Because they have not got criminal records you should take that into account in considering whether they are therefore more likely to have been truthful to you.  b) Would someone who has reached their ages without a criminal record have started offending now? It is relevant to your assessment of them because it may support the argument that they are not the sort of people who have a tendency to be law breakers.  These are not defences, because obviously no one would otherwise ever be convicted for a first time if they could rely on these two points as an answer to an allegation. You must take them into account, but it is for you to decide how much weight you give them.  Comments  The Prosecution and Defence barristers will make comments to you in their speeches, seeking to convince you of the strengths of elements in their cases and weaknesses in the other side’s case.  If those comments and arguments help you then please take them into account in your own thinking about the evidence, but you have to decide this case on the basis of your assessment of the evidence and not on the basis of anyone else’s.  It is possible that you may sense that I have a view about some parts of the evidence. I do not intend to influence your views one way or the other and I don’t intend to do so in this summing-up. You alone are the judges of the facts.  Evidence  What I will do is to pick out what I think may be the most useful and relevant parts of my notes to remind you of the evidence.  Because you are the judges of the evidence, not me, take no notice of any things I remind you about which you think are irrelevant.  Equally, if you remember things which I do not mention, pay attention to what you recall.  Final practical points  Don’t suffer in silence – if you need to be reminded of any of the evidence that has been given (remembering there cannot be any further evidence presented to you), or you need me to explain some part of the law more clearly, just send me a note and I will do what I can to help.  If some of you need the occasional break for a smoke then arrangements will be made for that.  Take all your papers with you when you go out to decide on your verdicts. There is no time pressure on you. If you are still discussing the evidence at around 4:30 and have not reached your verdicts I will have you back into court then and send you home overnight with some further legal directions. We will then resume again the next morning.  In addition the jury were given a series of questions in a “Route to Verdict” document. This is set out here. Again, the formatting is not identical to that in the jury’s version:  ROUTES TO VERDICTS  Count 1 MILO PONSFORD (MP), SAGE WILLOUGHBY (SW) & RHIAN GRAHAM (RG)  Q1: Are you sure D, jointly and together with others, played a part in the pulling down of the Edward Colston statue on 7 June 2020?

241,180825809422023326749205504588279799909,"Brexit: What trade deals has the UK done so far? By Tom Edgington  BBC Reality Check Published 21 October 2021  Image source, Getty Images  The UK has agreed a free trade agreement in principle with New Zealand.  Since Brexit, the UK has had the freedom to pursue its own trade deals. So far, it has signed trade deals and agreements in principle with 69 countries and one with the EU.  However, the majority are ""rollover"" deals - copying the terms of deals the UK already had when it was an EU member, rather than creating new benefits.  What is a free trade deal?  A free trade deal aims to encourage trade between countries by making it cheaper. This normally applies to goods, but occasionally to services as well.  Making trade cheaper is usually achieved by reducing or eliminating tariffs. These are government taxes or charges for trading goods across borders. A car importer might have to pay a 20% tariff on top of the vehicle's price, for example, to bring it into a country.  Trade agreements also aim to remove quotas (limits on the amount of goods that can be traded).  Trade can also be made simpler if countries have the same rules, such as the colour of wires in plugs. The closer the rules are, the less likely that goods need to be checked.  Image source, EPA Image caption, The UK-Japan deal was signed in October 2020  Why have tariffs and quotas at all?  While free trade agreements aim to boost trade, too many cheap imports could threaten a country's manufacturers. This could affect jobs.  For that reason, a government might choose to put tariffs on certain things. Tariffs on car imports, for example, could help protect local car makers from cheaper vehicles coming in from abroad.  What is the UK-New Zealand deal?  The latest UK trade deal is an agreement in principle reached with New Zealand on 20 October.  New Zealand is a small UK trading partner, accounting for less than 0.2% GDP. So the deal is unlikely to boost the UK economy by much. However, the deal could lead to more New Zealand lamb being sold in the UK.  As well as removing tariffs on goods such as clothing and machinery, the UK government says the deal will also cut red tape for businesses. Labour and the National Farmers Union, however, say the deal could hurt UK farmers and lower food standards.  What does the UK-EU trade deal mean?  After Brexit happened on 31 January 2020, the UK and EU needed to decide the rules for their future trading relationship.  This was important because the EU is the UK's largest and closest trading partner.  After months of negotiation - which went down to the wire - a UK-EU trade deal came into force on 1 January 2021.  The deal prevented any tariffs and quotas being introduced - which would have made it more expensive to trade.  Image source, Getty Images Image caption, The UK-EU trade deal went down to the wire, with fishing proving to be one of the major sticking points  But not everything is the same as it was before Brexit.  As the UK no longer has to follow EU rules on product standards, new checks have been introduced.  Strict EU laws on animal products also mean some UK products can no longer be exported.  The deal also does not completely eliminate the possibility of tariffs in future. Both sides will need to stay close to shared rules in areas like workers' rights and environmental protection. If either the UK or the EU shift their rules too far, the other side could introduce tariffs.  What happened to the trade agreements the UK was already part of?  Before Brexit, the UK was automatically part of any trade deal the EU had negotiated with another country. At the time the UK left, the EU had about 40 trade deals covering more than 70 countries.  The UK has negotiated rollover deals with 63 of these countries.  Image source, Getty Images  The UK is still discussing rollover agreements with a further three countries, but all the major ones are done.  Any existing EU agreement that was not rolled over ended on 31 December with trade then taking place on World Trade Organization (WTO) terms until a deal could be reached.  Trading on WTO terms means importers face tariffs and extra paperwork. For example, a shipment of bananas arriving at Portsmouth from Ghana was charged a tariff of £17,500 in January. Since then, an agreement with Ghana has been reached.  What about a UK-US trade deal?  The US is already a significant UK trading partner, accounting for £1 in every £6 of British trade.  Some smaller deals have already been reached - such as the export of British beef to the US, after a ban of more 20 years.  What about other trade agreements?  Image source, Getty Images Image caption, British farmers are worried about competing with cheap foreign imports, such as beef  The Australia deal, announced on 15 June, was the first trade agreement negotiated from scratch by the UK since it left the EU - although it has not yet been signed off and implemented.  UK farmers say the deal will mean they will be undercut by cheap imports, which will cost jobs. However, the UK government says the agreement means many British products will be cheaper to sell to Australia. It also insists the deal will contain protections for farmers, such as a cap on tariff-free imports for 15 years.  A deal with Japan was signed in October 2020 - the first that differed from an existing EU deal.",Brexit: What trade deals has the UK done so far?,true

Storms named after women don't kill more than those with male names  NOTE: This headline and article have been significantly edited after publication to reflect that claims have been debunked of more deaths in storms named after women.  In the wake of Storm Eunice, questions are being asked as to how storms get their names.  It was previously suggested storms with female names were more deadly - but subsequent research has debunked the theory.  British, Irish and Dutch weather services group together to name storms and the final decision is taken by weather officials, who looked at a list of 10,000 names submitted for consideration by the public.  They go down the alphabet alternating between male and female names.  It was previously claimed you were more likely to die in a storm with a female name..  A 2014 study of American hurricanes, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, concluded that the practice of naming storms ""taps into well-developed and widely held gender stereotypes, with potentially deadly consequences"".  Researchers at the University of Illinois and Arizona State University claimed their studies found we're more likely to assume that storms with female names will be less dangerous.  In turn, they suggested this meant that people are less likely to take precautions to protect themselves and therefore the death toll is likely to be higher.  They said their model also suggested that changing a hurricane's name from Charley to Eloise could nearly triple the number of fatalities.  However, a subsequent research paper in 2016, published in journal Weather and Climate Extremes, found there was no difference in the death tolls.  They found several flaws, such as the original paper including storms between 1953 and 1978 when deaths rolls were higher and all storms had female names.  The authors of the later publication concluded: ""The assertion that female-named storms are deadlier than male-named storms is not robust, evidently because it relied on the questionable statistical analysis of a narrowly defined set of data.""",Storms named after women don't kill more than those with male names,true
243,112470713217503327828111653392019766469,"While development of The University of Queensland's first iteration of a COVID-19 vaccine will not progress, the process matured their rapid-response ‘molecular clamp’ vaccine technology.  UQ COVID-19 vaccine project co-leader Professor Paul Young, project director Professor Trent Munro, and project co-leader Associate Professor Keith Chappell.© The University of Queensland  In late 2020, the decision was made to abandon further trials of a COVID-19 vaccine being developed by The University of Queensland (UQ) in partnership with biotech company CSL, after participants in a Phase 1 trial returned weak false-positive HIV screening results in some tests. Although there was never any chance of HIV infection, the implications for HIV testing in Australia and for the uptake of the vaccine were deemed sufficient to redirect significant Australian Government commitments to other areas, such as supplying more doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine.  Researchers involved in the development of the vaccine, produced using UQ’s proprietary ‘molecular clamp technology’, were disappointed, but some aspects of the work gave them encouragement. “The group was devastated, as we wanted to help,” says Professor Paul Young, project co-leader along with Associate Professor Keith Chappell. “But we've taken many positives out of the project: we are further down the line in validating the platform technology and we’re very confident going forward.”  Why clamps in vaccines?  Enveloped viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, infect a host via proteins protruding from their surface that bind to and fuse with a target cell’s membrane, allowing the virus to enter a cell. These fusion proteins are the basis of many subunit vaccines, a type in which a part of the pathogen being vaccinated against is injected to prompt the body to efficiently raise an immune response that can protect against the live virus.  Structural model of the trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike protein ectodomain (prepared by D Watterson), stabilized by the molecular clamp (red). https://vimeo.com/392914003© Dr Dan Watterson, The University of Queensland  The SARS-CoV-2 spike or fusion protein is a trimer: a group of three units, each consisting of a receptor-binding subunit, S1, and a subunit responsible for fusion, S2. The three S1 and S2 subunits form a fusion spike embedded in the viral membrane and held in a very particular conformation until it binds to a target cell.  “The fusion protein on the surface of the virus behaves remarkably like a mousetrap in that it's held in a highly tensed form,” explains Young. Binding to a receptor triggers a very rapid structural change, with some parts of the protein flipping through 180°, pulling the viral membrane and the host membrane close together to allow them to fuse.  “The trouble is that the final stable post-fusion form of the protein is not what is on the viral surface and so is not an appropriate form to stimulate a strong protective immune response in a vaccine. Many of the important antigenic sites on the spike protein become hidden or disappear because they literally change shape.” The same conformational change occurs when the spike protein is isolated or made by recombinant technology to produce a soluble subunit vaccine.  UQ’s molecular clamp technology was designed to hold the spike protein in its original form to produce a useful subunit vaccine.  Trying to quickly clamp down on COVID-19  Between 2008 and 2011, Keith Chappell and others had been involved in a study on respiratory syncytial virus-induced disease. That study showed that in naturally infected individuals the majority of potent neutralizing antibodies were those responding to the pre-fusion form of the protein, not the post-fusion form. This was the impetus for building the molecular infrastructure to maintain a spike protein in its pre-fusion form.  The UQ clamp that was developed consists of fragments of the fusion subunit of HIV’s spike protein, gp41. While other trimerization proteins, such as foldon from the T4-phage fibritin, were tried, the resulting structures were unstable and wouldn’t keep well in storage. Further structural modification was needed to achieve stability, whereas fusion proteins clamped using the gp41 fragments were stable on their own.  The gp41 fragment sequences, which are shaped as coils known as alpha helices, link to the end of each of the spike protein’s three fusion subunits (S2s). The alpha helices spontaneously fold and interact with helices on the other monomers. “What you end up with is a very stable, tightly bound six-helical bundle comprising three sets of two alpha helices folded back on themselves,"" explains Chappell. The bundle structure stabilizes the spike protein in its pre-fusion conformation.  Previous work had identified three main areas of the trimeric spike proteins of many enveloped viruses like SARS-CoV-2 where modification might improve stabilization and expression. Using the genetic sequence of the virus that produces the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, the researchers used a trial-and-error approach to generate more than 200 versions of the spike protein in a short period. These were monitored to identify those most efficient at generating a stable spike trimer and most efficiently expressed in cells. “This required no knowledge of the protein structure,” stresses Young, “which can significantly speed up the process of producing vaccines for newly identified viruses.”  The UQ group had previously generated clamped fusion proteins of more than 10 different viruses using gp41, including Ebola, MERS, a wide range of influenza types, herpes simplex, and Nipah viruses. An important proof-of-principle result was rapid antigen production against two, somewhat exotic, but potential emerging viral pathogens - a paramyxovirus first identified in Achimota in Ghana and a mammarenavirus first identified in Wenzhou in China.  “We asked whether we could take a sequence from these two viruses, apply the principles we’ve learnt and make a vaccine candidate very quickly, without knowing anything about the protein structure,"" explains Chappell. “The whole intent was to apply the technology to the threat of emerging disease,” notes Young.  UQ COVID-19 vaccine team member Eve Radunz.© The University of Queensland  False positives stop planned trials  The detection of false HIV positives in all of the trial participants, albeit at very low levels and only in some assay types, halted progress to the next stage of trials. “The design of the clamp was such that the major antibody binding sites of gp41 weren’t present, so we had anticipated that if there was an antibody response to HIV it would be very minor,” says Young. HIV diagnostic assays only detect human antibodies, so it was not until the Phase 1 trial that researchers could really test for the impact of diagnostic interference. Participants were advised ahead of the trial of this possibility.  “The diagnostic cross-reactivity was very weak, and although there was never any chance of HIV infection, a wide-scale rollout of the vaccine would have a real impact on the way we diagnose HIV,” says Young. The association with HIV may also have had an impact on vaccine uptake. While their Phase 1 trial will be completed this year, the planned Phase 2/3 trials have been taken off the table.  “You need to remember we were in the middle of a research project, and the plan was to look at a wide range of clamp constructs, but when the pandemic hit we went with using what we had in our toolbox, the gp41 construct, which we knew was working well in animal models. If COVID-19 had hit in 2021 and not 2020 we would have had an extra year to do that work,” says Young.  Current work is focused on looking at similar clamp constructs from other viruses and systems that have the same level of stability as gp41 in order to re-engineer a clamp 2.0.  “I don’t use the word ‘failure’,” says Young. “It is the lessons learnt from these experiences that help you go forward.”",Molecular clamp vaccines: lessons from a setback,true
244,75714273335803486870707476272699141063,"Vaccines work. They have played a critical role in breaking the link between infection and severe outcomes, and we should express our gratitude to the scientists who developed life-saving vaccines against COVID-19 and to those who work tirelessly every day to roll out the vaccine programme at pace, across the country.  In this blog I would like to explain how we use different data sets to look at the impact of vaccination in the population.  The UK Health Security Agency is committed to openness around data and has been at the forefront of publishing evidence to show the effectiveness of the UK vaccination programme. We were first to show that COVID-19 vaccines offer high protection against the Delta variant of the virus and this data has been regularly shared with policymakers and the public.  As well as this, the UKHSA publishes rates of cases, hospitalisations and deaths by vaccination status, and the data in our report shows that the rates of hospitalisation and deaths are substantially lower in fully vaccinated people, across all age groups. It is clear therefore that COVID-19 vaccines provide a high level of protection against severe outcomes.  To make our data less susceptible to misinterpretation, the UK Health Security Agency has worked with the UK Statistics Authority to update some of the data tables and descriptions in the report, specifically around rates of infection in vaccinated and unvaccinated groups. In our commitment to transparent and clear data, we regularly review our publications to ensure they reflect the current situation within the pandemic, and we will continue to work with our partners at the statistics bodies, to ensure our reporting is as scientifically robust as possible.  Case rates in vaccinated versus unvaccinated people  UKHSA publishes vaccine effectiveness by vaccine and has done for many months. This is the source that should be used to understand how effective vaccines are in the population as there is a well-established method for calculating this.  We separately publish the rates of COVID-19 cases, hospitalisations and deaths in vaccinated and unvaccinated groups by age. This is important to understand the implications of the pandemic to the NHS and to help understand where to prioritise vaccination delivery.  A simple comparison of COVID-19 case rates in those who are vaccinated and unvaccinated should not be used to assess how effective a vaccine is in preventing serious health outcomes. This is because these figures are susceptible to a number of differences between the groups, other than the vaccine itself, and these biases mean that you cannot use the rates to determine how well the vaccines work.  If we look at the numbers of cases in vaccinated compared to unvaccinated people, the rate of cases in the vaccinated people appears higher for many age groups. This is because there are key differences in the characteristics and behaviour of individuals who are vaccinated compared to those who are unvaccinated. The rates therefore reflect this population's behaviour and exposure to COVID-19, not how well the vaccines work. We also know that, as infection rates have been high over the summer, many people were previously infected, and this has had an impact on the rate of infection in recent weeks.  Several important factors can affect the rates of diagnosed COVID-19 cases and this may result in a lower rate in unvaccinated than in vaccinated people. For example:  People who are fully vaccinated may be more health conscious and therefore more likely to get tested for COVID-19 and so more likely to be identified as a case (based on the data provided by the NHS Test and Trace).  Many of those who were at the head of the queue for vaccination are those at higher risk from COVID-19 due to their age, their occupation, their family circumstances or because of underlying health issues.  People who are fully vaccinated and people who are unvaccinated may behave differently, particularly with regard to social interactions and therefore may have differing levels of exposure to COVID-19.  People who have never been vaccinated are more likely to have caught COVID-19 in the weeks or months before the period of the cases covered in the report. This gives them some natural immunity to the virus for a few months which may have contributed to a lower case rate in the past few weeks.  These factors are all accounted for in our published analyses of vaccine effectiveness which uses the test-negative case control approach. This is a recommended method of assessing vaccine effectiveness that compares the vaccination status of people who test positive for COVID-19, with those who test negative.  This method helps to control for different propensity to have a test and we are able to exclude those known to have been previously infected with COVID-19. We also control for important factors including geography, time period, ethnicity, clinical risk group, living in a care home and being a health or social care worker.  We calculate the rate of cases in people who are vaccinated by taking the number of people who have tested positive and who have been vaccinated, and comparing to the total number of people who have been vaccinated in each age group.  The denominator  To calculate the percentage of people who have been vaccinated, we need to know how many people are eligible to receive the vaccination, this is called the denominator. Although it would seem straightforward, there is a degree of uncertainty about the true denominator. The two sources that are most commonly used to derive a denominator are:  The NHS national register (called NIMS) includes everyone who registered with the NHS and is therefore eligible to be called forward for a vaccine. Although NIMS is not perfect, it represents each unique individual who is being targeted for the vaccination programme and provides the only comparable information on key criteria for those who are targeted and those who are vaccinated. One of the basic problems with NIMS is that it contains some people who were registered with the NHS but may have moved – for example overseas – but these people have not yet been removed from the database – these are often called “ghosts”. Because vaccine uptake has been so high, even a small number of additional people included in the database will inflate the number recorded as unvaccinated – so this makes the rate of COVID-19 cases in some of the younger unvaccinated groups appear lower than it should be.  The second main denominator is the Office of National Statistics (ONS) which provides an estimate of the total number of people in each age group in the middle of each year. This is based on the 2011 census, and it updates the estimates each year using other surveys and sources of data. Using this population estimate as a denominator would potentially avoid some of the “ghost” people in the younger age groups – but it would also give rise to other issues. As the ONS data is not based on a list of unique individuals, it does not allow linking of a COVID-19 case to an individual’s vaccination status. This limits any analysis of uptake by some key criteria. As well as this, the current estimates seem to be undercounting in some older age groups. As rates of COVID-19 in older people are those we need to be most concerned about, because these age groups are at highest risk of hospitalisation and death – using the ONS denominator gives some inconsistent age-specific rates for these more severe outcomes.  Neither is perfect, however for estimating rates of cases by vaccination status we consider that using NIMS to identify those who are vaccinated and those who are unvaccinated is the best way to provide stable and comparable data, even though we accept that the infection rates in unvaccinated younger groups may seem lower than the true figure. These figures are useful for planning, for example in understanding workload in hospitals, but should not be used for assessing how effective the vaccine is. Vaccine effectiveness analysis of routine data is only possible by using the variables coded in NIMS and available at an individual level for all people who come forward for a test.  What data should we be looking at?  Data on COVID-19 hospitalisations and deaths is much less prone to bias, as testing is more complete, and so it is more valid to compare rates for these severe outcomes. But even so a properly conducted analysis is much more reliable, as explained above.  Our publication of COVID-19 vaccine surveillance data is consistent with all the other vaccine surveillance data we publish and this consistency is important for understanding the patterns we see across all of our surveillance data sources. We have consistently published the data in this way, aligned to other vaccine surveillance data, since early in the year.  We believe that transparency - coupled with explanation – remains the best way to deal with misinformation. UKHSA has been committed to regular publishing of our vaccine effectiveness data and sharing this evidence promptly with others – this has played a huge role in increasing vaccine confidence in this country and worldwide.",Transparency and data – UKHSA’s vaccines report,true

Military officials announced this week that, after months of warnings, they have begun disciplinary actions — including discharge.  The Air Force was the first of the branches to announce dismissals, saying Tuesday it had discharged 27 people who refused to get the vaccine. On Thursday, the Marines said it had discharged 103 troops. The Army has reprimanded 2,700 soldiers and said it will begin discharge proceedings in the new year. And the Navy this week told commanders to start ""administrative separations"" for ""vaccine refusers.""  But the vast majority of the armed services have followed orders. In the Navy, 98.4% of its force fully vaccinated, according to the Associated Press. The Air Force says 97.5% have received at least one shot. Army officials said that 98% of active-duty forces have received at least one dose of the vaccine, while 96% — nearly half a million people — are fully vaccinated. About 95% of Marine Corps forces have gotten at least one shot.  That still leaves potentially thousands of active-duty soldiers who might be forced out in the coming weeks or months. Although that would slightly reduce the size of the military, the Pentagon says it's important to keep that in perspective.  In the Army's case, for instance, less than 1% of the force has refused the vaccine. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin is most concerned with ""the readiness of the force and the importance of the vaccine,"" Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told reporters. Getting the vaccine, he said, is ""the best way to protect themselves and their units.  The Pentagon began requiring members of the military to get vaccinated in late summer. There are ""active discussions"" within the Pentagon about requiring booster shots as well, Kirby said. The booster shot provides strong protection against the omicron variant of the coronavirus, medical officials have said.  Thousands of troops across the services have asked for exemptions from the vaccine requirement, some of which have been granted. Medical exemptions are often available when, for instance, someone is allergic to a vaccine ingredient, or has an underlying health condition that could cause adverse reactions.  At least 12,000 service members have asked for religious exemptions, none of which have yet been granted. Religious exemptions are ""always rare,"" Kirby told reporters earlier this month.  ""This has absolutely nothing to do with trampling on the religious liberties of our men and women in uniform,"" he said. ""It's about a military medical requirement to keep them safe, to keep their family safe, to keep their units safe.""  The Pentagon has also required all National Guard members to get vaccinated against the coronavirus, but some states have pushed back. Republican governors from five states wrote to the defense secretary this week arguing that the Pentagon didn't have the authority to discharge Guard members for refusing the vaccine.",U.S. military moves to discharge service members who refuse to get vaccinated,true
246,136877672540866039935562506754237172175,"The Government has today (26 October) announced that the Environment Bill will be further strengthened with an amendment that will see a duty enshrined in law to ensure water companies secure a progressive reduction in the adverse impacts of discharges from storm overflows.  The amendment bolsters the raft of measures already being taken by Government through the Environment Bill, which as currently drafted will put in place more protections against water pollution than ever before.  Earlier this year the government published a new set of strategic priorities for the industry’s financial regulator Ofwat, which set out the direction from government that water companies must take steps to “significantly reduce storm overflows” and that the regulator should ensure funding should be approved for them to do so. This publication – known as the Strategic Policy Statement - strongly influences investment decisions and is one of Government’s key tools in driving action from water companies.  This amendment will enshrine that expectation in law, to further align the Bill with the government’s strategic priorities for the sector and help to drive action from industry.  Environment Secretary George Eustice said:  Earlier this summer, the Government published a new strategic policy priorities for Ofwat and the water sector asking them to significantly reduce the discharge of sewage from storm overflows in the next pricing review. Following a debate in the House of Commons last week during the final stages of the Environment Bill, today we are announcing that we will put that commitment on a statutory footing with a new clause.  During wet weather, storm overflows release diluted wastewater into rivers, preventing a combination of sewage and rain from overloading the sewers and backing up into homes and businesses. As climate change has led to greater rainfall, and water infrastructure has not kept pace with population growth, their use has increased in recent years.  Significant penalties have already been handed out to water companies discharging unacceptable amounts of sewage into our rivers. Earlier this year, Southern Water received a record-breaking £90m fine, while Thames Water was handed £4m and £2.3million fines for separate incidents.  The Government will hold underperforming companies to account, and is already taking direct action to deliver progressive reductions in the harm caused by storm overflows through measures in the Environment Bill, including:  a new duty directly on water companies to produce comprehensive statutory Drainage and Sewerage Management Plans, setting out how they will manage and develop their drainage and sewerage system over a minimum 25-year planning horizon, including how storm overflows will be addressed through these plans.  a power of direction for the government to direct water companies in relation to the actions in these Drainage and Sewerage Management Plans if they are not good enough. We will not hesitate to use this power of direction.  at least one new target to drive progress in the priority area of water. In our policy paper published in August 2020, we set out the objectives for targets currently under consideration. For water, these include reducing pollution from agriculture, wastewater, and abandoned metal mines, and reducing water demand  a new duty on Government to produce a statutory plan to reduce discharges from storm overflows and their adverse impact, and report to Parliament on progress.  a requirement for government to produce a report setting out the actions that would be needed to eliminate discharges from storm overflows in England, and the costs and benefits of those actions. Both publications are required before 1 September 2022.  a new duty directly on water companies and the Environment Agency to publish data on storm overflow operation on an annual basis.  a new duty directly on water companies to publish near real time information - within one hour- on the operation of storm overflows.  a new duty directly on water companies to monitor the water quality upstream and downstream of storm overflows and sewage disposal works.  The Government has also taken significant action outside the Bill:  Between 2020 and 2025, water companies will invest £7.1bn on environmental improvements in England, including £3.1 billion on storm overflow improvements alone.  We have committed to undertaking a review of the case for implementing Schedule 3 to the Flood and Water Management Act 2010 in England. This Schedule would set mandatory build standards for sustainable drainage schemes on new developments.  All of these measures are informed by the work of the Storm Overflows Task Force which brings together key stakeholders from the water industry, environmental NGOs, regulators, and Government in order to drive progress in reducing sewage discharges. The Taskforce has agreed a long-term goal to eliminate harm from storm overflows.  The age of our Victorian sewerage system means a complete elimination of discharges from storm overflows would be extremely challenging and initial assessments suggest would cost over £150bn according to the Storm Overflows Evidence Project, commissioned by the Storm Overflows Taskforce. The full research report will be published shortly.  Our Environment Bill will ensure we deliver the most ambitious environmental programme of any country - transforming how we protect our natural environment, make better use of our resources and clean up our air and water.  The Government has previously made amendments that set a new, historic legally-binding target to halt species decline by 2030 and allow ministers to introduce charges on all single-use items, not just plastics, helping to cut waste and put an end to throwaway culture. New measures will also help landowners secure long-term environmental benefits through conservation covenants and better protect ancient woodland in England.  The amendment is also very similar to Amendment 45 in the name of the Duke of Wellington, which was debated in the House of Commons on Tuesday. The Government will bring forward the amendment in the House of Commons, when the Bill returns there for the next stage of passage.  The Strategic Policy Statement to Ofwat is a very powerful tool for the Government to drive action from water companies, as it strongly influences investment decisions and financial assessment. The Government consulted on the Strategic Policy Statement recently.",Environment Bill further strengthened to tackle storm overflows,true
247,157679702758490264555844801457701517025,"December 2021 kicked off meteorological winter with a broadly warm – albeit dull – month of weather, during which the UK reached its highest New Year’s Eve temperature on record, with 16.5°C at Bala (north Wales). Maximum temperatures also exceeded 15°C in all four nations. This is according to provisional figures released by the Met Office.  The unusually high temperatures seen on New Year’s Eve coincided with a temperate end to December, resulting in some stations breaking long-standing one-off records for the month. Cromer in Norfolk saw its warmest December day in a 103-year series with 15.4°C recorded on 30th December.  For the complete month, it’s the notably high minimum temperatures recorded in December that stand out from the statistics, especially in southern areas. The UK had an average minimum temperature in December of 2.8°C, which is 1.4°C above the 1991-2020 long-term average; figures that have recently been updated to reflect the latest 30-year meteorological period. The highest average minimum temperature seen in December stands at 5.2°C, set in 2015.  For southern areas, minimum temperatures were even further from the meteorological averages, with southern England seeing average minimum temperatures at 4.3°C, which is 2.0°C above the long-term average for the month. There were some exceptionally mild nights, with overcast conditions and a south-westerly flow drawing air from the Azores. Daily minimum temperatures on New Year’s Eve remained widely in double figures, with several stations including Sheffield, Bradford and Buxton recording their highest daily minimum temperature on record in series of over 100 years – around 10°C higher than the December average.  Average minimum temperatures versus the long term average for December 2021  The often mild, cloudy nights resulted in below average days of frost for the much of the UK. There was an average of just 11.5 days of ground frost reported across the UK in December, well below the long-term average of 16.3 days. The fewest average number of days of ground frost in December was in 2015, with just 5.8 days.  Average number of ground frost days in the UK in December 2021 versus the long term average  Despite the relatively high temperatures, sunshine hours in December 2021 have been in short supply, with an average of just 27.6 hours for the UK, less than one hour per day on average and only around two-thirds of the normal December sunshine total. That’s little enough to make it the dullest December since 1956, when an average of 19.5 hours of sunshine was seen. It was also the UK’s sixth dullest calendar month in records from 1919. England saw 60% (30.6 hours) of its average sunshine, Wales 69% (28.3 hours), Scotland 79% (23.6 hours) and Northern Ireland only 54% (20.7 hours).  The dull but warm conditions have provided an unusual mix for the country’s gardeners. Chief Horticultural Advisor at the Royal Horticultural Society Guy Barter said: “After milder weather and limited frosts so far this winter, greens such as Brussels sprouts and leeks have kept growing and winter flowers such as autumn flowering camellia and Christmas roses have not been spoilt.  “Weeds too have kept growing but with dull conditions they won’t set seeds and can be spared for now to help wildlife. Lawns remain remarkably green but growth has been limited by a lack of light, so the lawnmower can rest a bit longer.”  Sunshine duration for the UK versus the long term average for December  Rainfall was relatively near average for much of the UK, although areas in the northwest generally saw less than their average. Northern Ireland received 113% (136.6mm), whereas Scotland received 79% (136.8mm). The UK had 90% of its average rainfall (115.1mm).  Mike Kendon from the National Climate Information Centre said: “December will largely be remembered for the unseasonable warmth we saw in the middle and end of the month. As a result, we have seen relatively few days of ground frost and air frost and less of the cold weather that you’d normally expect at the start of winter, although some northern spots have seen some hard frosts. There were also remarkable temperature inversion conditions for several days in Scotland where the warmest and sunniest place to be was across the mountain summits.  “This spell of weather in the middle of the month was driven by an established area of high pressure over the UK, keeping temperatures well above average for spells, although low temperatures did take charge in the early part of December.”  December 2021 also saw a white Christmas declared by the Met Office, with a flurry of snow over high ground in the north of the UK.

These objects are defined as asteroids that are more than about 460 feet (140 meters) in size with orbits that bring them as close as within 4.6 million miles (7.5 million kilometers) of Earth’s orbit around the Sun. CNEOS continuously monitors all known near-Earth objects to assess any impact risk they may pose.  The orbital positions of near-Earth objects come from the databases of the Minor Planet Center, the internationally recognized clearinghouse for small-body position measurements. This data is collected by observatories around the world, including significant contributions from amateur observers. The vast majority of asteroid-tracking data, however, is collected by large NASA-funded observatories (such as Pan-STARRS, the Catalina Sky Survey, NASA’s NEOWISE mission and, in the future, NEO Surveyor). Planetary radar projects (including JPL’s Goldstone Solar System Radar Group) are another key component of NASA’s NEO Observations Program.  The Center for Near-Earth Object Studies is home of the Sentry impact-monitoring system, which continuously performs long-term analyses of possible future orbits of hazardous asteroids. There is currently no known significant threat of impact for the next hundred years or more. The Center also maintains the Scout system that continually monitors brand-new potential near-Earth object detections, even before they have been confirmed as new discoveries, to see whether any of these generally very small asteroids might pose a threat of short-term (possibly imminent) impact.  CNEOS also supports NASA’s planetary defense efforts by leading hypothetical impact exercises to help educate national and international space and disaster response agencies on the issues they would face in an actual asteroid impact scenario.

250,307151533892901483648643944423164905471,"Foreword – the Prime Minister  Nearly 2 years ago, after decades in hibernation, the UK finally re-emerged on the world stage as an independent trading nation and global champion for free trade.  And since reclaiming our own chair at the WTO , our feet have barely touched the floor. Seldom has a week seemed to pass without another FTA being signed, sealed and delivered somewhere in the world. The numbers continue ticking relentlessly upwards but at the time of writing we’ve already secured agreements covering something like two-thirds of all British trade and with countries that run, if not quite from A to Z, then certainly from Albania to Vietnam.  But an FTA is ultimately just a tool. And while this blizzard of British diplomacy has been bad news for protectionists, mercantilists and isolationists the world over it will only be good news for British businesses and British workers if we learn to use that tool properly.  That’s what this strategy is all about. Helping you make the most of our new-found freedoms by bringing the whole government together to deploy a cornucopia of trade outposts in distant lands, experts to provide the support you need, trade shows to put you in the international shop window, finance for those who need it and more besides so that businesses large and small, from every sector, in every part of the United Kingdom can start selling to every market in the world.  It will help us build back better from the pandemic, giving businesses the support they need make the most of their potential and exploit the UK’s new competitive edge.  It will help take our green industrial revolution worldwide, making it easier than ever for UK companies to share cutting-edge carbon-free technology with the places where it’s needed most.  And it will help with this government’s core mission of levelling up the whole United Kingdom, spreading opportunity and prosperity right around the country.  It’s a welcome shot in the arm for UK PLC, the start of a new and exciting chapter for us all, and I look forward to working with employers of all shapes and sizes as we once again make the UK a nation that does business with the world.  Foreword – the Secretary of State for International Trade and President of the Board of Trade  Free trade agreements are the lifeblood of my department. But they won’t mean anything if UK businesses don’t take advantage of them.  That’s why, in setting out our new world-leading Export Strategy, I want to set some joint goals – goals for both business and government.  First, I want to fire the starting gun on the Race to a Trillion. UK exports are due to hit the £1 trillion mark by the mid-2030s, but I want us to hit that mark before then. I want us to be audacious and to aim for the end of the decade – not as a target, but as a goal.  Second, I want each and every corner of the UK to see exporting as a natural business goal. Exporting isn’t just for the South East of England. It can and must be a force for levelling up the UK.  And third, I want every business to see their products as a potential export. The Made in Britain logo has always been a stamp of quality – from Sheffield steel to Scotch whisky to Welsh lamb. But now that stamp could equally be on Peppa Pig or the Premier League. We export world-class services and culture as well as manufactured goods or agricultural produce.  To achieve these goals, we will need joint working between government and business. And we will need a change of mindset in both. That’s what this strategy sets out to achieve. Government will lend its weight to providing the advice, the expertise and the marketing. Business will do what it does best – selling its world-class products and services.  Our strategy responds to and anticipates changes in the global economy, by tilting towards the Indo-Pacific. At the same time, we will tighten ties with traditional trade allies, the source of prosperity over centuries. We know global markets want the UK’s high-quality goods and services. And we start from a position of strength – the UK is the world’s sixth largest exporter and the second largest services exporter.  Our future prosperity lies, in part, in exports. Exporting businesses are more competitive, pay higher wages and are more profitable. Global sales support local jobs. And international revenues boost the UK’s finances, so that we can reinvest in public services. Our strategy will therefore support our wider aspirations as a nation. Working with exporters of digital, artificial intelligence, shipbuilding and green goods and services will help realise our ambitions as a science and technology superpower and in the Net Zero transformation. Together, we can level up the country by sparking an exporting revolution that will ensure we build back better and stronger than ever.  Executive summary  There’s a world of opportunity, matched by the UK’s export potential — our strongest export markets are typically found in markets like the United States or Europe. However, the global economy is changing. Rapid economic growth in the Indo-Pacific region is shifting the world’s centre of economic gravity eastwards. The world economy is also expected to become more services-oriented, and the UK’s specialist sectors are predicted to grow faster than the global average.  Exports are a critical part of our economy — exports support millions of jobs in the UK and evidence suggests important links between trade and productivity. This export plan seeks to ensure these benefits are felt across the country. It will build the exporting capability of critical sectors, such as tech and clean economy. This will support the government’s Innovation Strategy, Net Zero Strategy and Ten Point Plan for a Green Industrial Revolution.  We are refreshing our approach to meet our trading context — our 2018 Export Strategy laid strong foundations for export policy, promotion and support, but since then the trading environment has changed significantly. Our refreshed strategy will demonstrate how we will ensure certainty and continuity of the support we provide to exporters. It also sets out our new, clear strategic approach to capitalise on our new trade agreements and market access work.  Our ambition is to reach £1 trillion in exports annually — we want businesses to be ambitious in their exporting. Projections suggest that we will reach £1 trillion in exports annually by the mid-2030s, but we think can get there faster if we work together. We are therefore challenging business and government to Race to a Trillion. This strategy will be the joint framework for us to accelerate that race and grow our economy through exports.  Delivering in partnership with business is critical — the strategy will explore Better Support, Better Access to Finance and a Better Business Environment for exporters. Each of these is underpinned by Better Data to ensure we target our activity for the greatest impact. We will work with business on implementation and continue to challenge ourselves on improving our offer. We will use existing governance to monitor implementation and use our new monitoring and evaluation framework to assess our progress.  Made in the UK, Sold to the World — the strategy comprises a 12-point plan which sets out the path that government will take to transform our support offer and Build Back Better. This will allow the UK to level up and project Global Britain. Among other initiatives the plan includes a range of new support measures, including the new Export Support Service ( ESS ) and the UK Export Academy.  We will support strategic sectors and maximise our comparative advantage — we will seek to maximise on the potential of the UK’s world-leading sectors, such as digital services, clean economy, life sciences and creative industries. We will also focus on sectors of national significance such as agriculture, food and drink and shipbuilding. We are partnering with industry to provide impactful, sector-specific support.  We are ready to trade with our closest trading partners, emerging economies and developing markets — we know our work to open markets in the Indo-Pacific is critical if we want to maximise our comparative advantage and export performance. We will develop new relationships in these regions, for example through our accession to the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership ( CPTPP ). We will continue to strengthen ties with longstanding trading partners.  Our strategy is underpinned by core values — we take pride in our values, which align to exporting best practices, which we will uphold and reflect in our trade agreements. We will not compromise our commitments to protect the environment and tackle climate change through trade. We will continue to champion equality and opportunity for all. We are also committed to upholding rules-based trade.  A world of opportunity  Our strongest export markets are typically found in markets like the United States or Europe. However, the global economy is changing. Rapid economic growth in the Indo-Pacific region is shifting the world’s centre of economic gravity eastwards. China, India, Brazil, Russia, Indonesia, Mexico and Turkey collectively are expected to equal the G7 ’s share of global import demand by 2050.[footnote 1] Other economies, such as Vietnam and the Philippines, are expected to grow even more rapidly in the coming decades.[footnote 2] Between 2000 and 2019, the Indo-Pacific region accounted for 50% of global economic growth in real terms. By 2050 this is expected to be 56%.[footnote 3]  The most successful exporting nations will need to create and sustain market share in these economies. Our assessments show that the UK’s comparative advantage in exporting high quality goods and services is particularly adapted to exploiting these markets. The markets for these goods and services is growing as the middle class expands.  Chart 1: Regional drivers of global economic growth in real terms [footnote 4]  Chart 2: World population by income threshold[footnote 5]  In 2019, there were around 1.7 billion ‘middle class’ consumers in the world – equivalent to 1 in every 5 people (Chart 2). By 2050, the global middle class could reach 3.5 billion people – equivalent to 1 in every 3 people. Over half of these middle-class consumers are likely to live in China and the Indo-Pacific.  Trade is expected to become gradually more services oriented, as rising incomes shift spending patterns in emerging markets and as moves to enhance supply chain resilience lead to increased reshoring of manufacturing. By 2030, services sectors are expected to account for 77% of global gross domestic product ( GDP ), up from 75% in 2019. At the same time the UK’s specialist sectors are expected to grow faster than the global average in the coming decade.[footnote 6] Global import demand for UK specialist sectors is expected to grow from £6 trillion in 2019 to £9.2 trillion by 2030.[footnote 7]  Chart 3 – Global GDP by sector, 2019 to 2030[footnote 8]  Free trade is evolving, and the UK has an important opportunity to trade more and trade differently. We are embarking on a new era in our trading relationships, negotiating innovative, world-leading free trade agreements with the markets of the future. By aligning our agreements and relationships to UK priorities, we are creating export opportunities that work for all parts of the UK. For example, our new free trade agreement with Japan, while delivering benefits across the economy, contains cutting edge digital and data provisions which support UK tech and digital-savvy firms to export to Japan.  We also want our exporters to be active in developing markets. For example, our recent government- to- government agreement with Peru has opened a new market for many UK businesses, with opportunities in the portfolio worth £1.7 billion. As we Build Back Better, developing countries will benefit from high quality UK project expertise, as we committed to in the G7 Carbis Bay agreement. UK exporters can access opportunities in emerging markets that are opened and supported by the UK’s development work including Official Development Assistance ( ODA ) spending, such as from the British Support for Infrastructure Projects ( BSIP ) programme and Growth Gateway.  The aim of this refreshed strategy is to help UK business to grow through exporting. Whether through manufacturing or services, if we embrace that collective mission, nominal exports have the potential to reach £800 billion by 2030, and £1 trillion by the mid-2030s, or even sooner if we can get more businesses across the UK exporting.[footnote 9] This strategy will help make that projection a reality.  Our strategic context  Now is a pivotal moment for UK exporters. We must seize the export opportunity of an independent trade policy by negotiating UK trade agreements and making exporting easier for UK business so we can Build Back Better. Exports support millions of jobs, enable small businesses to increase their productivity, and extend the UK’s economic ties across the globe. Our export plan lays the groundwork for UK exporters to thrive. We are fundamentally an open and liberalised economy that is ready to do business and trade with the world.  We are taking important steps across our domestic policy to build our exporting capability in critical sectors, such as the clean economy and technology. Our Innovation Strategy, Net Zero Strategy and Ten Point Plan for a Green Industrial Revolution will shape the UK as a science superpower. Measures like Help to Grow will raise the productive capacity of business, and help firms internationalise in the process. We will capitalise on the government’s economic policy development. We will cement our exporting values of competitive imports, innovative ideas and foreign demand, all underpinned by a resilient and productive business base.  Our strategic approach  Business has asked for consistency in policy, so this strategy builds on our 2018 Export Strategy.  We will continue to:  encourage and inspire businesses that can export but have not started or are just beginning  and inspire businesses that can export but have not started or are just beginning inform businesses by providing information, advice and practical assistance on exporting from the public or private sector, or their peers  businesses by providing information, advice and practical assistance on exporting from the public or private sector, or their peers connect UK businesses to overseas buyers, international markets, and each other  UK businesses to overseas buyers, international markets, and each other put finance at the heart of our offer  This strong platform is the basis for our action-oriented refreshed strategy. It will enable us to adapt to the changes demanded by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and make the most of our legislative freedom.  To take advantage of new trading opportunities made possible by new free trade agreements, this approach will allow us to:  encourage and inspire businesses, and promote UK exporters in markets including those where we have signed, or are negotiating a free trade agreement.  give businesses the right information to benefit from these trade agreements, and make it easier to trade  connect UK businesses to overseas buyers or intermediaries, and ensure we are engaged with business and governments as we implement agreements or resolve barriers to trade  Taken together, we will support companies globally to take advantage of the preferential terms we have secured, no matter what stage they are at in their export journey.  Our ambition  The world has moved on since 2018. The UK has left the EU. We are recovering from a profound crisis triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time, deeper shifts are accelerating growth in Indo-Pacific markets and in future-oriented services sectors powered by innovations in digital technology. As we emerge from the crisis and turn our eyes to the future, we believe that we should set ourselves a bold national ambition. This is a whole-economy endeavour to mobilise our efforts in support of our project to boost exporting in Britain.  Race to a Trillion  In 2019, the Conservative Manifesto promised to redouble efforts towards exporting and we want to set an ambitious target to realise this commitment. We are challenging government and business to Race to a Trillion, with a shared ambition of lifting UK exports to £1 trillion each year.  Our projections suggest that we will reach this level of exports in the mid-2030s, but we think we can do better if we work together. Our refreshed Export Strategy embodies a 12-point plan for exports that will be the joint framework for business and government to work together to accelerate our Race to a Trillion.  Making it happen  We need to act now. Exporting is critical to UK jobs, and we know international markets are becoming increasingly competitive. UK trade agreements pave the way for easier exporting, and we must capitalise on our new trading relationships to take exporters to the fast-growing markets of the future.  Our action-focused plan will deliver:  better support – transforming our service offering to new and existing exporters, being more joined up and more digital to reach small and medium-sized enterprises ( SMEs ) at scale  – transforming our service offering to new and existing exporters, being more joined up and more digital to reach small and medium-sized enterprises ( ) at scale better access to finance – ensuring no viable export fails due to lack of finance or insurance  – ensuring no viable export fails due to lack of finance or insurance a better business environment – making it easier to export, raising the competitiveness of all UK exporters and helping developing country partners to improve the climate for trade  – making it easier to export, raising the competitiveness of all UK exporters and helping developing country partners to improve the climate for trade better data – harnessing new technologies and legal powers to target support, inform policy and identify export opportunities  Our effort will be focused on where we can add value. We will not try to offer services that the market is better placed to provide. Rather we will focus on where markets fail and where we can add value. We will do what only governments can do.  Working in partnership with business is critical to our success. Whether resolving market access barriers, enhancing our trade diplomacy or providing critical support and finance, we will choose partnership to unlock the UK’s economic and exporting potential. We will work with business to foster positive change in the culture of exporting for all parts of the UK, all local communities, and all sectors of the economy. In joint enterprise, business and government can work together to build a Global Britain of commerce and trade.  In this spirit, we will work closely with business representative organisations, trade associations and the UK’s sector leaders to champion UK businesses of all sizes on the world stage. We will work with all UK nations, the mayoral combined authorities, local authorities, the British chambers and regional partners such as the Midlands Engine Partnership, NP11 and the planned Northern Powerhouse growth body. We will work with these partner organisations to capitalise on their networks and regional insight. This strategy will also align with the wider business support offer, including growth hubs, as part of the wider Enterprise Strategy, to be launched in 2022.  As a signal of this intent, and in recognition of the critical role, insight, and leverage of business in this joint endeavour, we will support the launch of the Trade in Services Council ( TISC ) alongside this Export Strategy. Led by industry and with support from the Department for International Trade ( DIT ), it will include trade associations and a wide range of services companies of all sizes to bring together a collective voice on cross-services priorities related to the promotion of international trade.  We applaud the services sector coming together to create this Council, coordinated by the Confederation of British Industry ( CBI ). It will be an important forum to boost trade in services across the UK, working in partnership with government to articulate the value of services trade to the UK economy. We will also be working in close partnership with business through our engagement fora to oversee the implementation of the strategy.  These new projects will bring business and government together to take an action-oriented, economy-wide view of how we best implement and realise the ambitions in this strategy. Our export plan will put business at the heart of decision-making on the steps that we collectively take to embrace the opportunities that flow from our independent trade policy.  Introducing our 12-point plan: Made in the UK, Sold to the World  This is a national effort, led by business, supported by government.  Here is how government will play its part:  Last month we launched the new ESS , our first ever end-to-end service to support businesses exporting to Europe. Over £45 million in funding has been awarded over the Spending Review 2021 period for the digital transformation of DIT ’s export support services, delivered through an expansion of ESS to cover all markets. In September we opened new offices in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and a second DIT HQ in Darlington, with dedicated teams that for the first time will focus on extending the opportunities from the government’s international trade work across the UK, levelling up export growth and supporting jobs. This is historic. Through the European Regional Development Fund ( ERDF ), the Internationalisation Fund is providing 7,500 SMEs in England with financial assistance to export and internationalise. We will launch the UK SME Export Support Fund, to provide SMEs with financial assistance to internationalise. Our world-leading export credit agency, UK Export Finance ( UKEF ), will expand its products and delivery network to boost support to UK exporters and their overseas buyers. We will focus on strengthening a joint approach, connecting governments and business through our global networks. We will extend the reach and range of our pilot Export Academy to offer bespoke training programmes and digital tools to help businesses navigate the technicalities of exporting and find opportunities overseas. We will extend our community of Export Champions, ensuring businesses can build and learn from exporting successes through business-to-business networking and peer-to-peer learning. We will champion the government’s priority sectors through our innovative campaign Made in the UK, Sold to the World. We are piloting our UK Tradeshow Programme ( UKTP ) to propel our efforts and promote Team UK at the world’s largest tradeshows. We will put exporting at the heart of reforms to regulations, cross-government measures and regulatory diplomacy to help foster the conditions for exporting businesses to thrive. We will utilise the UK government’s international teams based in over 180 global markets to provide sector and market specific support to innovative, high growth companies to help them grow internationally. We will continue to open new markets for UK exporters through our new trade deals, with the ambition of covering 80% of UK trade by the end of 2022, and broader work to remove market access barriers.  1. Export Support Service  We have created a new end-to-end ESS for UK exporters.  Through the ESS we have developed a single point of contact and entry for exporters to Europe.  Over £45 million funding has been awarded over the Spending Review 2021 period for the digital transformation of DIT ’s export support services, delivered through an expansion of DIT ’s new Europe-focused ESS to cover all markets.  The ESS has 3 main aims:  simplify guidance and access to support for business  target specific difficulties businesses are having in exporting to Europe  promote the opportunities and support government offers  If you’re a UK business selling goods or services to Europe, you can contact the UK government export support team by phone or online.  Our staff are here to provide guidance on:  exporting to new markets  paperwork you need to sell your goods abroad  rules for a specific country where you want to sell services  To ask the export support team a question, visit https://www.gov.uk/ask-export-support-team.  This is the first end-to-end support service for exporters. Built with the expertise from our highly regarded International Trade Advisers, ESS has a single point of entry and interactive service provision, working closely with British Embassies and High Commissioners to support businesses in-market.  In the longer term, we are working to ensure that export services are digital by default and to create a seamless journey across GOV.UK. We will also use the insight gained from working with businesses to shape future UK government policy, ensuring exporter interests are factored into decisions. Finally, subject to the success of the programme, we will be expanding ESS to support businesses exporting to anywhere in the world.  Going forward, we will be aligning ESS with other DIT initiatives to create an export system that supports businesses at all stages of their export journey. This will include providing global in-market insight, business connections and export support for high potential SMEs to help them break into and grow in new markets. The reform of this overseas support is already active in the China, North America, Africa, and Latin America and the Caribbean Her Majesty’s Trade Commissioner ( HMTC ) regions. We will be rolling out the service in the Middle East, Afghanistan and Pakistan HMTC region over the next few months. From April 2022, we will expand to Europe, Eastern Europe and Central Asia, Asia Pacific and South Asia HMTC regions.  2. Supporting exporters across all parts of the UK  We will extend the reach of our export services across the whole of the United Kingdom. As part of this mission, we will invest significant new resource in ensuring that potential exporters across the country can access the support that they need to grow their business through exporting.  Previously, DIT ’s presence has been largely localised to our headquarters in London.  To increase our capacity to support businesses across the UK, we have:  opened new Trade and Investment offices in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland  established a second DIT HQ in Darlington  DIT will have over 550 roles stationed in these offices by 2025.  Through these offices we will support businesses to export, attract investment and take advantage of the opportunities of our new FTAs . We will engage businesses on trade policy and market access issues that reflect local priorities and the competitive advantage of sectors and specialisms around the UK.  The UK government, through DIT , is responsible for international trade agreements. We share with the devolved administrations the responsibility to help businesses in Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland to export. Our dedicated nation teams, alongside the Local Enterprise Partners ( LEPs ), will articulate and amplify our offer in each home nation, providing better access to our global network. Our Export Strategy will bolster and complement Wales’s Export Action Plan, Northern Ireland’s 10X Economy and Scotland: A Trading Nation. Our offer will also support business sectors important to the local economies on the world stage through campaigns and by ensuring that UK trade policy reflects the diversity of the UK.  The brilliant endeavours of UK exporters are exemplified by the recipients of the Queen’s Award for Enterprise. This scheme promotes outstanding business achievement in International Trade and other areas. We will use our new local presence around the country to encourage more exporters to apply to the scheme.  By being closer to the communities and businesses we support, our future operations will be based on a better understanding of the challenges faced by local populations and industries.  Case study: Queen’s Award for International Trade Hiretech Limited is a leading, independent equipment rental and personnel supply company, based near Aberdeen in Scotland. “We have enjoyed the success of achieving a Queen’s Award, both in terms of the recognition of the hard work and dedication of our staff, and also the vast promotional and profile-raising opportunities it has created for Hiretech.” – Hiretech  3. Financial support for exporters  We have launched the £37.8 million European Regional Development Fund ( ERDF ) Internationalisation Fund, which provides 7,500 SMEs in England with financial assistance to build their capability to internationalise. We know that UK businesses continue to face a range of barriers to exporting. 57% of UK businesses reported ‘costs’ as a moderate or strong barrier to exporting.[footnote 10]  SMEs can receive matched grant funding of up to £9,000 to support a range of export-related business activities and overcome barriers to trade.  This includes market research, visits, advice to protect UK intellectual property, attendance at trade fairs, translation services, consultancy and more.  This advice and support will provide businesses with the tools they need to create jobs, raise productivity, and thrive overseas.  We’ve listened to business and know you want government grants to be consolidated and more accessible. We have £23 million set aside to support exporters in 2022 and are considering how best to enhance our support offer from 2023 onwards.  Case study: Gordon Rhodes Gordon Rhodes has been in business over 40 years supplying spices and seasonings to retail, meat manufacturers and butchers throughout the UK. After a devastating factory fire Gordon Rhodes were looking to rebuild the brand and one option was to try and sell overseas. Through research they recognised that the US market was strong and consumers there valued UK products, so identified a potential market for their range of products. Gordon Rhodes received support from their International Trade Adviser to access grant funding through the Internationalisation Fund (supported by the European Regional Development Fund). This allowed them to pay for specialist advice to protect their Intellectual Property and packaging designs in the US market. Gordon Rhodes have also attended DIT webinars and events to gain an understanding of various foreign markets. “We would not have been in a position to take advantage of the overseas opportunities without the help and support of DIT.” – Gordon Rhodes  4. UK Export Finance  UKEF , the UK’s world-class export credit agency, will expand availability of its products to better support the finance needs of UK exporters and take advantage of the UK’s new FTAs .  UKEF supports UK exporters and suppliers of goods and services with access to finance and insurance where the private sector is unable to, helping UK business win, fulfil and get paid for international trade. As the economic recovery continues, UKEF will expand its offering, continuing to support exporters and suppliers across the whole of the UK and contributing to economic growth and employment.  Supporting exporters through the economic cycle  The pandemic period has been particularly difficult for businesses, and UKEF has been at the forefront of the government’s response to support companies through the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020 to 2021 6 out of 10 SMEs reported a decline in growth and profitability and the demand for finance increased.[footnote 11] During this period, UKEF saw a significant increase in demand from companies of all sizes, and provided £12.3 billion in finance and insurance for UK exporters and supporting around 107,000 jobs.  Enhancing UKEF ’s offer  Working with the Office for Investment and the UK Infrastructure Bank, UKEF will now support companies’ investment into future UK exports. UKEF ’s Export Development Guarantee ( EDG ) allows UKEF to provide 80% guarantees on loans of £25 million and above to support companies’ general expenditure, including facilities, research and development and general operations. Under this strategy, UKEF will expand eligibility for the EDG to companies that do not currently export, including those that do not have operations in the UK but are seeking finance to establish themselves here and export. By enabling international investment into UK export capabilities, this will support the development of UK supply chains in new high-growth sectors.  Supporting the development of exports in new clean growth sectors and technologies remains a priority. As part of its new commitment to achieving net zero across its portfolio and operations by 2050, UKEF will offer green economy exporters access to increased lending capacity. UKEF will provide its EDG on extended repayment terms so they can seize new export opportunities and invest in future export capacity.  UKEF will ensure that it continues to meet the financing needs of exporters, large and small, across the whole of the UK. To do so, it will work closely with partners from the private sector and with other UK government bodies. This includes the UK’s Development Finance Institution, CDC, and the British Business Bank to enhance export opportunities and ensure partner governments are aware of the full UK financing and investment offer.  Smaller exporters face specific challenges in accessing finance and UKEF has made considerable strides in its support for SMEs in recent years. The General Export Facility ( GEF ) was introduced in 2020 to unlock working capital to support a business’s overall growth, rather than being tied to a specific export contract. UKEF has now increased the amount companies can access automatically from their bank, without the need for separate approval. UKEF is also working to expand its range of delivery partner financial institutions, including challenger banks and alternative lenders, to allow more businesses to access support.  To ensure we can help SMEs offer their buyers attractive payment terms, UKEF will shortly launch a new, simplified Bills and Notes Guarantee. This will allow SME exporters to be paid immediately while a financing bank subsequently seeks payment from the overseas buyer on the basis of bills of exchange or promissory notes. These instruments are more relevant for smaller businesses and lower value exports and can be arranged at lower cost. Alongside the Standard Buyer Loan Guarantee launched earlier this year, this new product means UKEF can effectively support the full range of debt finance instruments SMEs use in international trade.  UKEF also helps SMEs secure opportunities with the large international projects it supports through supplier fairs. These procurement-led events connect contractors and overseas buyers with UK exporters and suppliers. Through its overseas network, UKEF will continue to seek out opportunities to capitalise on demand for world-leading UK goods and services, giving SMEs opportunities they normally wouldn’t have exposure to.  Through its SME -targeted marketing campaign, The Exporter’s Edge, and its network of export finance managers across the UK, UKEF is engaging with business more than ever. When businesses are unable to secure the finance they need to export, they can have the confidence that they can come to UKEF . We are also actively working to build exporter understanding of access to finance by supporting the DIT Export Academy to launch a dedicated finance module in 2022.  Case study: Simworx UKEF supported Simworx, a technology company from Kingswinford, enabling them to complete projects in countries around the world including Malaysia, New Zealand and Vietnam. Through its bank, HSBC, Simworx took advantage of UKEF’s General Export Facility (GEF). Simworx was provided with additional working capital to help finance their export business. Exports constitute approximately 90% of Simworx’s annual turnover and through GEF it has been able to raise advance payment guarantees to secure significant overseas contracts worth up to £8 million. Simworx has built its presence in the Middle East, Far East and Northern Europe and now plans for future expansion in these emerging markets post COVID-19.  5. Government-to-government partnerships ( G2G )  UKEF ’s financial backing will be underpinned by a new G2G provision. Led by DIT , this will ensure that UK businesses can access government business in critical markets around the world.  We know that businesses value partnerships with government, particularly when working in new or unfamiliar markets, and that global demand for government partnerships is growing. UK government teams in Embassies and High Commissions around the world can help by building relationships, and identifying and creating opportunities for major commercial partnerships linked to government-to-government cooperation.  We will focus on strengthening a joint approach, connecting government and business through our global networks.  Our approach will put partnership at its core and, working together with industry, will seek innovative solutions and clean growth approaches. Contributing to the UK’s new Clean and Green Initiative, we will work with partners to address the infrastructure gap in developing countries. Our ambition is to support UK companies where they can really make a difference.  We have taken the first steps in the defence and security sectors and have added financial reinforcement through UKEF ’s support as a vital part of the offer. We can and will go further, broadening our offer to a wider range of sectors.  Case study: Reconstruction with Changes Following severe damage caused by climate cycle El Niño in Peru in 2017, Peru established the Reconstruction with Changes Authority to prioritise the rebuilding of vital infrastructure throughout the country. In summer 2020, DIT signed a G2G agreement with the Government of Peru to support the reconstruction of the country’s public services facilities. The G2G portfolio supported by the UK, valued at £1.7 billion, covers 118 interventions in the nine coastal regions of Peru. The programme’s UK delivery team (Arup, Gleeds and Mace) provides project management capability and technical assistance working side-by-side with the Reconstruction Authority. Our partnership will support the delivery of schools for over 44,500 children and enable healthcare for a population of over 1.45 million citizens. This partnership will also plant 56 million seedlings to support a nature-based solution for flood prevention works and the sequestration of carbon. This programme will implement the world’s largest integrated early warning system.  6. UK Export Academy  Our new UK Export Academy will offer SMEs the chance to learn how to navigate the technicalities of exporting and how to find new opportunities in overseas markets.  To meet our Race to a Trillion ambition, we want to help businesses looking to grow to move from reacting to incoming orders to proactively seeking new export opportunities. Our new Export Academy will help SME exporters meet their growth ambitions by learning directly from experts in international trade. In teaching them how to sell to international customers and secure contracts around the world, the Export Academy will help SMEs set their global ambitions high.  The Export Academy is an online facility available to a wide range of businesses and designed for owners and senior managers of SMEs . The core course of webinars and other virtual events such as masterclasses, mentoring, roundtables and networking events will give SMEs the tools and knowledge they need to start their export journey.  Our foundation course helps build the knowledge and confidence of SMEs that are new to exporting or want to start exporting. This course includes 10 educational online seminars businesses will leave that will help firms create an export action plan tailored to their business.  Our sector faculties will support businesses with sector-specific webinars, masterclasses, and virtual missions. Even more experienced exporters have something to gain from the sector faculties. Our tailored learning will support them to improve their export capabilities and operate effectively in specific foreign markets or sectors. For example, to stimulate space sector opportunities, the Space Sector Export Academy has already completed its first programme supporting SMEs to access the Australian market.  Our market access events will outline the benefits of new market opportunities, including from new free trade agreements.  The Export Academy is open to any business in the UK who has a product or service that can be sold internationally. It is for businesses who want to reach international customers and contracts, whether just starting their export journey or expanding into new markets.  Businesses can register now at events.great.gov.uk/exportacademy.  Case study: Avacare Avacare first approached DIT for help to identify potential target markets, develop an export plan and understand export financing options, as well as for introductions to overseas buyers. With advice from DIT and the local chamber in Singapore, they have secured an export deal in Singapore worth around £220k over 5 years. This contract constitutes an important entry into the Asian market for Avacare. Since the deal, there has been significant growth in the business, with turnover increasing from approximately £40,000 to £325,000 in the last 5 years. Currently, 95% of Avacare’s products are being exported.  7. Our exporting networks across the UK  We will develop our network of Export Champions across the UK. These experienced exporters are ready to offer their time to help businesses grow private sector links through the exporting journey.  We recognise the power of business-to-business networking. DIT ’s Export Champion Community of 1,700 individuals promotes the benefits of exporting amongst their peers and enables us to better understand the needs of business.  Export Champion - Jon Tibbs OBE, Chairman and Founder, Jon Tibbs Associates “Immerse yourself in the culture of your export customers. They will notice and appreciate every effort you make.”  We have handpicked over 400 Export Champions.  These experienced exporters, primarily CEOs, Sales Directors or Export Managers from a wide variety of sectors share their knowledge and personal stories to promote exporting by:  participating as speakers and panel members in programmes such as the Parliamentary Export Programme and Export Academy, providing informal advice and inspiring new potential exporters  featuring in DIT campaigns and media opportunities, and often amplifying these through their own networks  campaigns and media opportunities, and often amplifying these through their own networks hosting ministerial and VIP visits and roundtables  offering business insights to help inform DIT policy  policy in the case of many, undertaking their own activities and media in addition to the opportunities we provide  Case study: Dr. PAWPAW Dr. PAWPAW was created in 2013 when the daughter of its founders, Johnny and Pauline Paterson, was diagnosed with eczema, leading to the need for a natural alternative to normal steroid prescription creams. DIT recommended that the company exhibit at Cosmoprof Bologna in 2015. Through further careful recommendation, guidance and support, DIT has helped Dr. PAWPAW achieve over £1 million in sales. Johnny is now supporting other businesses through DIT’s UK Export Champions network, enabling more businesses to access guidance from experienced traders. “A massive thank you to DIT for its incredible contribution to securing our export business status over the years.” – Dr. PAWPAW  Export Champion - Laura Gunderson, Head of Commercial Development, BigVit’s “Always talk to your local DIT International Trade Adviser, they have a wealth of knowledge and a fantastic network of contacts they can connect you to, to help drive your export strategy forward.”  8. Export Campaign – Made in the UK, Sold to the World  We will extend our hugely successful Export Campaign designed to promote great UK products and services, with the agri-food and drink sector at its core amongst others.  Our new cross-cutting, national export promotion campaign Made in the UK, Sold to the World hosts trade promotion activities across the UK. The campaign engages with businesses and signposts them to the support they need to seize exporting opportunities. Our campaign has already begun with work to celebrate and support exporters in education, agriculture and the creative services. The campaign includes events, masterclasses, webinars, trade missions, ‘Meet the Buyer’ events, businesses roundtables, ministerial visits and much more.  Simultaneously, the GREAT campaign promotes the UK as the preferred supplier of goods and services in international markets. Whilst GREAT focuses on the supply-side, our overseas network with its global reach identifies markets UK businesses can meet. We will connect buyers to UK firms and ensure the smallest businesses from every region can champion Global Britain. We will help both those exporting for the first time and established exporters wanting to grow their market share.  We will open and promote new markets and trade opportunities, so that UK exporters can reap the benefits. We will focus domestically and internationally in the following sectors:  agri-food and drink  financial, professional and business services  creative industries  education  tech and digital  consumer and luxury goods  clean growth  Our objective is to enable economic recovery through exports and create jobs across the UK. Our message to businesses is simple: grow by exporting.  Case study: GeneFirst GeneFirst is a UK molecular diagnostics company focused on infectious diseases, cancer diagnostics and personalised medicine. It is a proactive developer and supplier of RT-PCR COVID-19 kits, including kits for Variants of Concern. “DIT has been very supportive in terms of building the GeneFirst brand awareness by introducing the organisation to potential distributors in regions deemed key targets for GeneFirst – in particular, Europe and South America. We believe this to have an impact for GeneFirst in increasing visibility and market reach for our other portfolios, including cervical cancer screening and Next Generation Sequencing for oncology testing.” – GeneFirst  9. Piloting a new UK Tradeshow Programme  International tradeshows are an invaluable opportunity for businesses to showcase their products to consumers and partners. Particularly for SMEs , tradeshows are a critical platform to access international markets. The networks developed at international tradeshows, often between innovative and established businesses, can be vital to developing sales and stimulating growth.  We want to ensure that we have the best programme in place to equip goods and services exporters to succeed in these platforms. We therefore plan to launch a new UK Tradeshow Programme ( UKTP ) until April 2023. The UKTP will be launched as a pilot to allow us to work with business to assess different approaches to encouraging businesses’ participation at overseas tradeshows through training.  UKTP is a service which aims to support UK-based SMEs to understand the benefits of exhibiting at overseas tradeshows and how they can maximise on their participation. We will support businesses in 2 ways.  Firstly, by supporting them with training and with grants to attend key tradeshows as a precursor to making the decision to exhibit there – so the business can decide how best to use the show in future.  Secondly, through the provision of essential market knowledge from trade experts to ensure that businesses exhibiting at some of the world’s most prestigious tradeshows can make the most out of showcasing their quality products and services. Some businesses will also receive a grant of up to £4,000 to count towards eligible exhibition costs.  Participants in the programme will receive both generic and event-specific training on how to make the most of tradeshows.  SMEs can apply to take part in UKTP through a new, simplified digital platform, making it easier for businesses across the UK to apply, and for DIT to monitor the pilot scheme’s effectiveness and ensure we can deliver the best support for business.  DIT is committed to working in partnership with trade associations, which have a vital role in supporting their industries. We have a joint goal of supporting businesses as they recover from the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.  DIT also continues to run overseas trade missions across a large variety of sectors and markets. These are designed to boost growing bilateral trade ties, demonstrating what British businesses have to offer on the global stage. This year, we have run missions highlighting tech and digital, fintech, food and drink, healthcare and life sciences and clean growth industries, to name just a few.  UK-based tradeshows are another route to attracting export business. One such tradeshow is Security and Policing (S&P), led by the Home Office, now approaching its 40th year. International delegations attend S&P to see first-hand UK security capabilities that might help address capability gaps in their nation state, thereby creating export opportunities for UK companies. “We have been exhibiting at Security and Policing for over 5 years. During that time, we have seen a significant growth in our overseas business and the show has undoubtedly contributed to that success.” – cellXion Ltd  10. Making exporting easier  The trade agreements we negotiate with other governments can make exporting easier. But we will also make conditions for trade easier for businesses by putting exporting at the heart of our own UK government policies and programmes. We will do this by making our borders and trade processes work smoothly and seamlessly and ensuring our approach to regulation supports trade.  Better regulation  Transparent and effective regulation will help DIT to conclude FTAs and maintain the UK’s global reputation as a good place to do business for exporters. As part of the UK’s new global trading freedom, we will prioritise innovation, competition, growth and inward investment. We will continue to build upon the UK’s global reputation for leadership in setting the highest standards of environmental, social and consumer protection. We have taken a whole of government approach to supporting businesses.  In addition, the Professional Qualifications Bill, currently going through Parliament, enables the government to empower regulators to strike deals on the recognition of professional qualifications with overseas counterparts, boosting UK businesses exporting services. It will also revoke EU-derived laws to give more autonomy to UK regulators to decide on the right approach to the recognition of overseas professional qualifications, tailored to suit the needs of their profession.  Case study: Freeports Freeports will play a significant role in boosting trade, attracting inward investment and driving productive activity across all areas of the UK. They will create high-skilled jobs in ports and the areas around them, prioritising some of our most deprived communities to level up the UK economy. Producers based in freeports will benefit from tax reliefs on capital investment, business rates and national insurance within freeport sites, alongside duty deferrals, inversions, VAT relief and simpler customs processes within customs sites – with the potential to enable re-exporting to international markets. Through this combination of special customs zones, tax reliefs at tax sites, and a wide range of other support, UK freeports will empower UK businesses to make the most of their exporting opportunities.  Regulatory diplomacy  We will use regulatory diplomacy overseas to share and influence global norms, regulations and standards, to improve market access for UK exporters, particularly in sectors critical to the UK’s future economic growth. We will tackle the regulations and standards required for exports that increasingly integrate digital and data, protecting and increasing market access. We will leverage the UK’s reputation as a leader and innovator in standards setting, and promote our approach of including UK businesses and industry in the standard setting process. We will also promote further regulatory co-operation internationally and between Commonwealth members, and other close trading partners.  Development cooperation  Our overseas development programmes led by the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office ( FCDO ) help to improve the environment for trade in developing countries and emerging economies, benefitting local businesses as well as UK exporters and investors. We support markets to develop through co-operation on areas such as standards, regulations, infrastructure, economic management and financial markets, helping to improve economic growth and flows of trade and investment. This helps developing countries to reduce poverty, while also creating a more conducive environment for UK businesses to operate and improving the resilience and quality of supply chains.  2025 UK Border Strategy  Our ambition is for the UK border to be the best in the world. A major part of this is helping to ensure that the practical barriers to exporting are as low as possible.  In 2020, the UK government published the 2025 UK Border Strategy establishing transformations to the UK border that the Cabinet Office, Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and government will ensure as the most effective and efficient in the world. As part of this, relevant departments are developing the Single Trade Window ( STW ), a single gateway for all data from traders into government. This streamlining of how businesses interact with the UK border will ease the business burden through efficiency and cost savings.  Through the UK’s new points-based immigration system, we are creating Skilled Worker, Global Talent and Health and Care visa routes, and suspending caps on skilled workers. Bespoke immigration routes will enable more students, scientists, academics, investors and entrepreneurs to come to the UK and contribute to our economic growth. The new system will also support companies, including SMEs , in high-growth sectors to recruit the right people into the right roles.  Digital trade  Innovation in trade facilitation does not stop at the border. We want trade between businesses and across borders to be easier, more digital and seamless. Digital trade is crucial to transforming the way in which commerce is transacted worldwide.  Internationally, we are leading the way through our trade policy. We are concluding a Digital Economy Agreement with Singapore. To go further at home, government will legislate, when parliamentary time allows, to introduce electronic trade records for B2B trade. This will streamline the process for business by removing the need for paper documents for some trade documentation. As well as increasing the efficiency of business interactions with the border, it will also directly support driving down costs, increasing security and would reducing our carbon footprint.  Our Digital Exporting Programme, which has helped thousands of businesses grow their global market digitally, will continue supporting companies through our digital trade and ecommerce experts, tools and global network of partners.  The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport’s ( DCMS ) tech sector team works to ensure that digital businesses can grow and thrive in the UK before expanding to other markets. This is achieved through access to finance, talent and markets, strategic communications campaigns, and the work of Tech Nation, which serves to generate confidence in the sector. We will also continue to support the development of Digital Boost, an organisation that provides small businesses and charities with pro bono digital advice from a network of over 2,000 digital experts.  11. Our global reach  We will strengthen our support in markets overseas to provide the networks of skilled advisers needed to support our critical exporting sectors.  Led by Her Majesty’s Ambassadors, High Commissioners and 9 Trade Commissioners, UK government staff around the world will contribute to levelling up in the UK. We will open markets, build global partnerships across sectors of UK strength, and help to grow the markets for UK goods and services through our overseas aid programme.  We will connect UK companies to buyers and ensure the tools of government are employed to support exporters to succeed in their journey. Our activities across the globe will seek to increase the competitiveness of existing exporters as well as facilitate the engagement of new businesses. We will continue to work to promote outward investment opportunities, which are vital to establishing new supply chains and export opportunities for UK firms.  The Prime Minister has appointed 33 Trade Envoys to raise our export potential. Appointed from Parliament and across the political spectrum, Trade Envoys strengthen the UK’s commercial ties in markets across the globe. Whether leading trade delegations or meeting foreign governments, they will work to ensure that UK businesses including SMEs can compete on the world stage and seize the export opportunity of the next decade.  This effort is complemented by an expert global network of International Export Finance Executives. This network brings local market, commercial and political knowledge together with UKEF support to change the way exporters can access markets. UKEF will expand this network from 15 to 30, based in important regional hubs such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Morocco, and the Balkans.  The UK government, in our Embassies, High Commissions and Consulates, works as one team to promote the interests of the UK. From collaboration in defence, migration, or science and technology, to advising businesses on the political and economic environment, or leveraging long-developed partnerships in growth sectors for the UK, we are working as one HMG to open opportunities for UK businesses. Our development finance and investment support complement this, promoting growth and poverty reduction in developing markets.  In the fastest growing tech markets of the Asia Pacific region, the UK’s new Digital Trade Network is increasing the UK’s technology expertise on the ground. Powered by a talented network of trade experts and Tech Nation’s new international programmes, it adds an extra level of support to UK tech companies seeking to export to this exciting region. This network focuses on providing expert trade support, supporting the adoption of digital technology; and creating new regulatory space for future British innovations.  Under this strategy the FCDO is planning to roll out its British Support for Infrastructure Projects ( BSIP ) programme, formerly known as the Developing Markets Infrastructure Programme ( DMIP ). This programme will help low income and lower-middle income countries to prepare, procure and finance high-quality, developmental public infrastructure projects that require funding support. BSIP will target sectors and geographies of UK strategic interest to take advantage of both developmental and trade objectives and can be blended with export credits including from UKEF . BSIP will help to level out the playing field with other countries’ concessional finance offers.  Outward direct investment case study: Konexa, Nigeria Konexa is pioneering a new energy service model to improve the energy service provided to consumers and businesses. In Nigeria, Konexa has deployed its ground-breaking integrated distribution model and upgraded 6,600 existing energy connections and 1,100 new energy connections. The £65 million investment will break the vicious cycle of under-investment in transmission and distribution and will do so drawing on mainly renewable sources of hydro and solar, connecting off-grid customers through least-cost technology. This project will create an estimated 75 permanent jobs directly and indirectly and reflects an important export into the Nigerian market. DIT will support Konexa to reach 10 more viable states across Nigeria and is currently mapping out other viable African countries in need of Konexa’s intervention.  12. Opening markets worldwide  We will continue to open new markets for UK exporters through free trade deals, addressing market access barriers identified by business and reforming the international trading system.  Leaving the EU has given the UK the opportunity to implement an independent trade policy for the first time in nearly 50 years. The UK can now pursue its own trade agreements, aimed squarely at making it easier for UK businesses to trade and securing access for UK exporters into overseas markets.  The UK has already negotiated trade agreements with 70 countries plus the EU.[footnote 12] These countries accounted for £766 billion of UK bilateral trade in 2020.[footnote 13] We will ensure UK businesses can take advantage of them by promoting the preferential terms, considering where we can simplify processes, and monitoring uptake. We will also continue our engagement with these countries once the deals have been done to secure the benefits for UK business. We will monitor and enhance the agreements we have and resolve any issues. We will seek opportunities to review and upgrade our existing agreements, starting with our FTAs with Canada and Mexico, to further tailor them to the benefit of the UK.  Our work doesn’t just stop there – we are pursuing an ambitious programme of new trade agreements, including in the fastest growing Indo-Pacific region. By the end of 2022, we aim for 80% of UK trade to be covered by existing and new trade agreements, giving more UK businesses access to preferential trading terms. We will negotiate new deals and build relationships with our trading partners to break down barriers to trade and support growth, jobs, and wages, with a particular focus on helping SMEs .  We have already reached Agreement in Principle on trade deals with Australia and New Zealand, and we are continuing to work towards a future full free trade agreement with the US. We have consulted on and are currently preparing for trade negotiations with India and hope to commence these before the end of the year. We have also launched a public consultation to help inform our approach for starting negotiations on a trade agreement with the Gulf Cooperation Council in the future.  The UK is on the pathway to membership of the CPTPP – one of the largest free trade areas in the world. CPTPP spans Asia Pacific and the Americas and includes some of the world’s biggest current and future economies which collectively represented 13% of global GDP in 2020.[footnote 14] Accession could see 99.9% of UK exports being eligible for tariff-free trade with CPTPP members – including on whisky and cars – goods which are in high demand in the Pacific region. With CPTPP countries projected to account for 25% of global import demand for meat products by the end of the decade,[footnote 15] this could for example mean more British beef and lamb to Vietnam and Mexico.  Our trade agreements with developing countries (economic partnership agreements) and our new improved trade preference scheme are under design. The Developing Countries Trading Scheme will help developing countries access UK markets, grow their economies and reduce poverty while also enabling British businesses and exporters to have access to a wider range of imports at lower prices.  We have also replaced the EU’s Common External Tariff with the UK Global Tariff ( UKGT ), which is tailored to the needs of the UK economy, and scraps red tape and unnecessary barriers to trade.  Our preferential trade agreements and UKGT are designed to improve access for UK business to a greater range of intermediate inputs and final products. This increased access to imports and integration into global supply chains supports businesses to export competitively.  In parallel with our trade agreements, we will continue to resolve specific market access barriers identified by UK businesses wherever they arise, so that they can trade and invest more freely. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) estimates that for most economies, the costs associated with non-tariff barriers are between double and ten times those associated with tariffs.[footnote 16] Government analysis of a set of OECD studies suggests that substantial liberalisation of market access barriers by just the G20 countries could boost UK exports by around £75 billion per year.[footnote 17]  To unlock this potential, we work in close partnership with business to identify market access barriers, and, once resolved, to raise awareness of these new openings around the world. The ESS will only make this easier for businesses from across the UK to benefit from this whole of government effort led by DIT . This work is particularly important in helping businesses reach emerging markets, where barriers are usually more common and harder to overcome without specific intervention.  Finally, we will work globally with partner countries to champion free and fair trade under rules fit for the 21st century. Safeguarding and championing the multilateral framework is crucial to our exporting success as it creates a global environment where businesses are treated fairly and can compete on merit. We will work multilaterally to strengthen the international trading system and reform the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) to update the global trading rules in support of free and fair trade. We will continue further liberalisation, promoting openness and co-operation in the face of collective challenges, including through our G7 Presidency.  Our vision for sectors  Our trading potential is core to our vision of an open, dynamic and productive economy, particularly in sectors where UK firms are leading the world: tech, clean economy, digital and creative. We will provide sector-specific support to innovative, high growth companies to expand internationally. The Export Strategy will augment our Innovation Strategy to propel our sectors into priority markets across the globe. By doing so we will not only be successful commercially but demonstrate our position as a science superpower.  Whether it’s harnessing the UK’s strengths in manufacturing, and supporting UK goods to reach buyers across the globe, or easing and enhancing services trade – the Export Strategy delivers for exporters of all kinds.  We will partner with industry to increase UK supply chain competitiveness through supplier development and increased opportunities for UK suppliers to bid for work in these major supply chains. This will increase UK prosperity, creating jobs and opportunities across the UK.  Services  Services contribute to around 80% of UK GDP each year,[footnote 18] and accounted for 49% of exports in 2020.[footnote 19] The UK has particular strengths in digital services, including financial, creative and media, education and training, telecoms, professional and consultancy services. We will improve access to new markets, promote services trade through campaigns, and support the launch of a new Trade in Services Council ( TISC ) with business.  Tourism  Travel services was the UK’s third largest services export sector in 2019, driven by £28 billion in direct visitor spend, making the UK the fifth most valuable destination worldwide in terms of inbound visitor spend.[footnote 20] Pre-pandemic, tourism directly contributed £74 billion to the economy, directly supporting over 1.7 million jobs, increasing to over 4 million including the wider supply chain.[footnote 21] The Tourism Recovery Plan sets out a comprehensive framework for rebuilding the sector and building back better.  Case study: Luminance The UK-Australia FTA includes ambitious commitments to increase opportunities for digital trade, reduce regulatory obstacles and increase transparency. This is an exciting development for UK Lawtech businesses such as Luminance, a firm which uses artificial intelligence and advanced machine learning techniques to read and form an understanding of legal documents. Lawtech activity in Australia is significant, and, in 2020, Luminance saw a 60% increase in the uptake of its technology firms based in the Asia Pacific region. Luminance is confident that the Australia FTA will bring strategic opportunities for Lawtech companies in the UK, ensuring it is the most attractive market to do business with.  Creative sector  British talent is renowned worldwide, and demand will continue to grow. Whether in television, film, music, design or gaming, the UK is world-leading in this growing sector. The government’s partnership with industry, including the British Fashion Council and British Phonographic Industry, will showcase the Best of British across all creative sectors on the world stage, opening new markets and opportunities for exporters to thrive in.  Financial, professional and business services  The UK was the world’s second largest net exporter of financial services,[footnote 22] exporting £62 billion in 2020[footnote 23] and is a global leader in fintech making up around 10% of the global market.[footnote 24] Professional and business services exports have risen dramatically from £48 billion in 2016 to £63 billion in 2019.[footnote 25] We will work with sector partners and trade bodies to encourage more financial and professional services firms to trade and grow internationally. We will also help those who already trade to grow business in new overseas growth markets.  Digital commerce and ecommerce  Digital commerce and ecommerce are transforming the global economic landscape and the way transactions are made internationally. We support a wide range of UK service-based businesses in their ambitions to internationalise digitally so they can take advantage of growth opportunities and meet competition in an increasingly digital world.  Agriculture  The agriculture, food and drink sector, including the UK’s largest manufacturing industry, contributes £127 billion to the UK economy in 2019 and supporting around 4 million jobs.[footnote 26] We will combat the barriers faced by our exporters, building on the success of securing beef exports to the United States, and we will support firms to adjust to new markets and compete worldwide.  Defence and security  Ensuring UK companies have effective market intelligence and can match our competitors will be crucial to internationalising the Defence and Security Industrial Strategy. We will project SMEs across the defence and security sectors globally, using our unique network of defence and security relationships around the world, and enabling the UK to remain at the forefront of defence innovation in both sectors. We will also support the growth of the UK’s cyber security ecosystem through exports.  Maritime and shipbuilding  With a proud history as a maritime nation, we will capitalise on the maritime sector to capture a significant global market share. We will also promote important technologies to improve the environmental performance of the global maritime fleet. We will generate an innovative and internationally competitive UK maritime offer, leveraging major UK strengths such as defence and low carbon technologies. The National Shipbuilding Office and future DIT export and investment initiatives will galvanise and promote the UK’s shipbuilding enterprise. This will help us become a world leader in new areas such as the green maritime sector.  Clean growth  Over the past 30 years, the UK has been at the forefront of the transition to green and will continue to be so with our Net Zero and Jet Zero ambitions. Whilst the opportunity for the UK is unprecedented, it is by no means guaranteed. The low-carbon economy has the potential to create £60 to 170 billion of export sales between 2015 and 2030.[footnote 27] We will capitalise on this opportunity by building export capability at home and opening markets abroad. Our new trade agreements and our multilateral trade policy will also reflect this ambition by seeking to open up new opportunities for low-carbon exports.  Aerospace  The UK civil aerospace sector is a world leader in the design, manufacture and support of wings, engines, advanced systems and components for civil passenger aircraft. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK aerospace sector (defence and civil) had an annual turnover of around £33 billion, with over 90% of products exported.[footnote 28] Our priority markets for promoting exports and securing investment are the US, Canada, Brazil and Europe. We will continue to focus our efforts here with major players such as Boeing, Airbus, Embraer, GE, Raytheon Technologies and Safran.  Case study: Boeing Prosperity Partnership 2021 marks the 5-year anniversary of the long-term partnering initiative for UK growth and prosperity between Boeing and the UK government across the aerospace, defence and space sectors. The programme has been designed to increase UK exports to the US, increase volume of UK content on Boeing programmes and promote Boeing investment into the UK. The partnership has delivered significant achievements, including £11 billion supply chain spend with 300 suppliers, 500 supplier teams attending Boeing industry events and UK suppliers being selected for new Boeing programmes. It has also enabled £200 million investment in new infrastructure projects, including Boeing’s first European manufacturing facility in Sheffield, and an 8-fold increase in R&D collaborations with SMEs.  Space  The UK’s space sector is already a strong exporter, with £5.8 billion of its £16.4 billion income generated through exports (year 2018 to 2019).[footnote 29] The UK seeks to build one of the most innovative and attractive space economies in the world. We will continue to develop new and innovative partnerships, like Space Bridges, with priority markets in North America, Europe, the Gulf, and Indo-Pacific.  Automotive  The UK has one of Europe’s most competitive car-making industries. Around 80% of the UK’s finished vehicles are exported to 150 markets and the sector generated £30 billion in exports in 2020.[footnote 30] Successfully transitioning to making zero-emission vehicles is critical to the future prosperity of the UK automotive sector. We will continue to support the automotive decarbonisation agenda through export orientated FDI to build resilience and competitiveness among UK manufacturers.  Education  The UK is recognised as a world leader in high quality education and skills. In 2018, education exports and transnational education activity contributed £23.3 billion to the UK economy.[footnote 31] The UK government’s International Education Strategy sets clear ambitions to achieve £35 billion in education exports per year and to sustainably recruit over 600,000 international students studying in the UK per year, both by 2030. Alongside the UK’s International Education Champion, Professor Sir Steve Smith, we will continue to deepen partnerships, promote export opportunities and address market barriers.  Infrastructure  Modern, high-quality infrastructure is essential for economic development, a healthy environment and people’s quality of life. UK companies are amongst the best in the world in developing and delivering infrastructure as demonstrated through high-profile megaprojects, including Crossrail, London 2012 Olympics, Heathrow Terminal 5 and High Speed 1 (HS1). Our Infrastructure Exports:UK initiative brings together government and industry to form a ‘Team UK’ approach to opportunities, prioritising markets where infrastructure pipelines complement UK strengths.  Case study: Tel Aviv Metro Since September 2020, Crossrail International (CI) has been providing strategic advisory and consultancy services to Israeli Government agency, NTA Metropolitan Mass Transit System. NTA is responsible for the delivery of the Tel Aviv Metro, a £33 billion, three-line underground network for the Tel Aviv metropolis. CI is also leading the development of UK-Israeli relations in the infrastructure sector, opening doors for other UK suppliers to enter the market. In association with the British Embassy, CI hosted a client forum onboard HMS Richmond, part of the UK’s Carrier Strike Group, at Haifa port.  Life sciences, healthcare and chemicals  Life sciences, including elements of healthcare and chemicals, is a diverse sector which also includes a large SME base, and one of the UK’s top exporters. Exports of medicines and pharmaceuticals alone was valued at £21 billion in 2020, 6.9% of total exports.[footnote 32] This is second only to exports of cars.[footnote 33] The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of the life sciences sector in achieving global economic recovery. The UK has potential for high growth in exports of both goods and services in this sector, including solutions to ease the global burden of chronic diseases and achieve healthier longevity. These play into the UK’s strengths as a science superpower and will drive a digital revolution in life sciences R&D and healthcare delivery.  Technology  The digital and technology sectors are a major strength of the UK. We are the leading European nation for building emerging tech businesses. In 2019, the value of services exported by the digital sector was £51.9 billion, and £17.4 billion of goods. [footnote 34] The continued growth of the sector relies on success in international markets. We will continue to provide a range of activities to support this sector, such as our Technology Growth Programme, which provides market understanding for entrepreneurs. Engaging with colleagues around the globe, we will ensure UK technology and digital companies are accessing the right opportunities at the right stage of their development.  Case study: the exporting potential of venture capital backed firms To support the UK’s agenda as a science superpower, in summer 2021 DIT piloted a programme to align DIT export support with a cohort of innovative UK companies which had received venture capital investment. Working with both investors and their portfolio companies, DIT identified, engaged and has begun to support these companies to access market opportunities in the USA, Australia and India. Companies on the programme had access to DIT resources via a dedicated account manager. The pilot engaged over 200 businesses and investors and is planned for expansion in 2022. The next phase of work will expand the criteria for support to include those companies receiving substantial innovation grants, patents and strategic sectors.  Our vision for markets  We will put the UK at the centre of a network of modern deals spanning the Americas and Pacific. In doing so, we will connect Global Britain to the markets of tomorrow, strengthen our bonds with our closest partners, including Commonwealth countries, and build UK exports in developing markets. We will continue to deepen our trading relationships with some of our closest allies, including the United States and the European Union. These markets are ready to trade, and we will continue to promote exporters across them.  Rapidly growing emerging markets offer new opportunities for UK trade over the next decade. To put the UK at the centre of future global growth, the majority of which is outside the EU, we must look to markets of the future. Almost 90% of world growth is expected to be outside the EU over the next 5 years.[footnote 35] The future of the global economy lies to the east in the Indo-Pacific. By 2030, 65% of the world’s 5.4 billion middle class consumers are expected to be in Asia.[footnote 36]  Our existing trade partners are important to us. We will continue to strengthen the support we offer exporters to these countries and regions.  We can use trade as an engine of economic transformation that allows developing countries to reduce poverty sustainably and exit from aid dependency. Our ODA programmes help build the capability of countries to engage in trade and investment, meet global standards and improve economic governance. They also help to build more competitive and inclusive markets, deliver better and cleaner infrastructure, overcome non-tariff barriers, empower women and tackle economic exclusion. We will complement this with a new focus on supporting exporters bidding for government contracts through G2G activity and support to help UK businesses capitalise on export opportunities flowing from ODA programmes. We will set out our wider approach through the new International Development Strategy.  Case study: Growth Gateway Led by the FCDO and DIT, the Growth Gateway is a business support service that provides dedicated, specialist advice and technical support to promote trade and investment between UK and African businesses. Through a digital portal on GOV.UK, it will connect businesses with the wide range of UK government advice and financial support available, as well as providing in-person support and market information to businesses in the UK and Africa.  Modernising trade  Our Export Strategy and 12-point plan reflects our aspiration to be a major trading nation, prosperous through trade and investment and influential as a proponent of free trade, open markets and the rules-based international system.  Our trading aspirations are underpinned by our values and as we Build Back Better, we must do so in a way that showcases the values of Global Britain. We take pride in our values, which align to exporting best practices and which we will uphold and reflect in our trade agreements. Our independent trade policy will help ensure protections for UK consumers and workers are upheld, building on our existing international obligations. We will not compromise our commitments to protecting the environment and tackling climate change.  Environmental  We are committed to safeguarding the environment. Between 1990 and 2019, the UK has reduced our greenhouse gas emissions by 44% while growing the economy by 76%.[footnote 37] Trade growth and emissions reduction are not alternatives. The green transformation is critical to the growth of the new green economy that will sustain and rebuild communities through new jobs and improved quality of life.  Our aim is to help foster high-value jobs in the low-carbon economy, propelling sustainable growth in all parts of the UK, and fuelling technological innovations that can be exported to the world. At COP26, we demonstrated our ambition to proactively work towards the Prime Minister’s 10 Point Plan for a Green Industrial Revolution. Our new trade agreements and our multilateral trade policy will also reflect this ambition by seeking to open up new opportunities for low-carbon exports.  Complementing these efforts, UKEF has committed to net zero emissions across its portfolio and operations by 2050, and is enhancing its green finance product offering. Alongside an enhanced EDG that will allow for longer-term financing for clean growth sector exporters, the Transition EDG will support companies investing in their transition to low-carbon business. Finally, a new, dedicated Renewables and Transition underwriting team is already offering specialist support and financing for customers looking to build their export business in the green economy.  Case study: UKEF backs £430 million green transition loan for Wood Plc In August 2021, UKEF announced the first ever government-backed green transition loan. It was awarded to the engineering and consultancy firm Wood to seize new clean growth export opportunities. A £430 million commercial loan will be supported by an 80% UKEF Transition EDG. This loan will give Wood the financial resources to enhance its clean growth plans, capitalise on green opportunities and support jobs.  Social  We are committed to championing equality and promoting opportunity for all. Our success will only be realised if the benefits of exporting are felt by business and the public across the whole of the UK. We will continue to ensure our trade supports environments which respect workers’ rights, and will work with our trading partners to uphold labour standards.  The G7 – under the UK’s Presidency – has looked at forced labour in a trade context for the first time. As a result, G7 Trade Ministers are identifying areas for strengthened co-operation and collective efforts towards eradicating the use of all forms of forced labour in global supply chains.  The government is committed to promoting women’s economic empowerment. We will build on our prior work to harness the potential for trade to support greater participation by women and under-represented groups, including disabled people, in the economy.  This will be underpinned by improving our data on diversity and inclusion in international trade. We will support initiatives and listen to what our stakeholders have to say so that we can ensure equality of opportunity across the UK.  Black, Asian and other ethnic minority owned businesses We understand the importance of equal access to opportunities for businesses. According to data from a recent study ‘Alone together: Entrepreneurship and diversity in the UK’ by the British Business Bank and Oliver Wyman, there are persistent disparities in outcomes for Black, Asian and other minority-owned businesses. The findings include: over one third of Black, Asian and other ethnic minority female business owners report making no profit last year, versus 15% of White female business owners  49% of Black entrepreneurs say they met their non-financial aims versus 53% of Asian and other ethnic minority entrepreneurs and 69% of White entrepreneurs We are committed to understanding and addressing the barriers faced by Black, Asian and other ethnic minority business owners, and providing the resources available to support these businesses with their exporting efforts.  Governance  We are committed to upholding rules based trade. The UK has been consistently clear that we will negotiate agreements that address the trade-distorting effects of corruption on global trade and fair competition.  We are positively considering how trade policy can complement our already strong anti-corruption measures and the ambitions set out in the government’s 2017 to 2022 Anti-Corruption Strategy. We continue to be actively involved in the influential OECD Working Group on Bribery, the G20 Anti-Corruption Working Group and other multilateral institutions supporting their work on anti-corruption policy and principles. UKEF routinely undertakes rigorous due diligence, including checks against financial crime (bribery, corruption, fraud and money laundering) and safeguarding taxpayers’ funds.  Implementing the strategy  We will implement this Export Strategy in partnership with industry and our regional and sectoral trade associations, through the ecosystem of export facilitation, advisory and finance services.  Our action-focused plan will underpin our ambitions for businesses and the country as we continually improve our service offer, providing:  Better Support – transforming our service offering to exporters, being more joined up and more digital to reach SMEs at scale  Better Access to Finance – ensuring no viable export fails due to lack of finance or insurance  A Better Business Environment – making it easier to export and raising the competitiveness of all UK exporters  Better Data – harnessing new technologies and legal powers to target support, inform policy and identify export opportunities  We will begin establishing the governance needed to effectively implement the Export Strategy across government. We will employ existing HMG governance established to monitor implementation progress and seek to further ensure that international trade is considered in domestic policy making.  We will work through our regular engagement fora with business to discuss the implementation of the strategy, identify barriers to delivery and develop innovative policy interventions for exports. We will take on your feedback to iteratively develop the strategy and implement it. We will work together to monitor and evaluate the outcomes of our interventions.  We will also support the creation of a Trade in Services Council, run in partnership with industry, to draw together the wide range of representative organisations and companies from across the sector. The Trade in Services Council will run for 2 years, and will establish a common voice, shared ambition and create a greater impact for the future of service trade.  We will implement the strategy through trade plans, which will be delivered with DIT teams in all parts of the UK and the government’s overseas network to achieve the Export Strategy’s priorities. We will ensure that this strategy joins up with ongoing work across all parts of the UK and the trade plans of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  Since 2017, DIT has developed a new monitoring and evaluation framework for its export promotion activities. This includes annual client surveys to track user experience and satisfaction, bespoke evaluations and a value-for-money model for DIT services. The framework has been carefully scrutinised by the National Audit Office, uses the latest appraisal and evaluation techniques, and has steadily improved the evidence on the influence of export promotion support.  DIT ’s priority outcomes and metrics  We will deliver, monitor and evaluate the strategy against the metrics as set out in the government’s Outcome Delivery Plans.  Priority outcome: secure world-class free trade agreements and reduce market access barriers, ensuring that consumers and businesses can benefit from both[footnote 38]  The performance metrics are:  UK trade with countries with which the UK has concluded a free trade agreement ( FTA ), as a percentage of total UK trade  ), as a percentage of total UK trade predicted GDP impact of each concluded FTA as per published impact assessment, including by UK nation and region  impact of each concluded as per published impact assessment, including by UK nation and region reduction in tariff barriers for each concluded FTA , as per published impact assessment (per cent)  , as per published impact assessment (per cent) cost reductions related to non-tariff measures (NTMs) for goods and services for each concluded FTA , as per published impact assessment (per cent) [footnote 39]  , as per published impact assessment (per cent) number of market access barriers reported and resolved on the Digital Market Access Service  Priority outcome: support UK business to take full advantage of trade opportunities, including those arising from delivering FTAs , facilitating UK exports  The performance metrics are:  value of exports supported (£)  export client survey satisfaction rates and number of service deliveries  total value of UK exports, including by UK nation and region (£)  UK outward foreign direct investment stock (£)  utilisation rate of trade preferences for tariff reductions (per cent)  survey estimates of the barriers faced by UK businesses to exporting, and the extent to which government services alleviated these barriers  Better data will underpin our implementation  The improved creation, adoption and utilisation of data is critical to our iterative approach to services in this strategy. Data sharing legislation within the new Trade Act will allow us to monitor and evaluate the outcomes of our Export Strategy interventions and improve our understanding of the exporter landscape.  Becoming more data-driven will ensure we shift from a demand-led model to a proactive one. We will use better data to identify areas of the UK that need government support, internationalise the government’s priority sectors and determine the markets of tomorrow.  While this is the central government approach, we recognise and support individual trade strategies from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, which will complement this approach with more bespoke account management.  Sustainable Development Goals ( SDGs )  The United Nations declared 2020-2030, a ‘Decade of Action’ and called ‘for the accelerating sustainable solutions to all the world’s biggest challenges’.

Who is likely to be affected  Employers, employees and the self-employed who are liable to pay National Insurance contributions and individuals that would be liable to pay National Insurance contributions were it not for pension age restrictions. Individuals who only pay Class 2 and Class 3 National Insurance contributions will not be affected.  2. General description of the measure  This measure provides for a temporary 1.25 percentage point increase to both the main and additional rates of Class 1, Class 1A, Class 1B and Class 4 National Insurance contributions for the 2022 to 2023 tax year and revenue raised will go directly to support the NHS and equivalent bodies across the UK. From April 2023 onwards, the National Insurance contributions rates will decrease back to 2021 to 2022 tax year levels and will be replaced by a new 1.25% Health and Social Care Levy where the revenue will be ringfenced to support UK health and social care bodies.  Individuals above State Pension age will not be affected by the temporary increase to National Insurance contributions for the 2022 to 2023 tax year but will be liable to pay the levy from April 2023.  The new Health and Social Care Levy will be subject to the same reliefs, thresholds and requirements of the qualifying National Insurance contribution (Class 1, Class 1A, Class 1B or Class 4) in respect of which the Levy is payable.  3. Policy objective  The Government is committed to responsible management of the public finances. The plan for health and social care set out by the Prime Minister and Secretary of State for Health and Social Care will lead to a permanent increase in spending. It would be irresponsible to meet these costs through higher borrowing, particularly in the context of record borrowing and debt to fund the economic response to COVID-19. The Government has therefore taken the decision to increase taxation.  All parts of the UK need a long-term solution to funding health and social care. This levy provides a UK-wide approach which enables us to pool and share risks and resources across the UK, leveraging the benefits of the Union for all our citizens.  3.1 Background to the measure  This measure was announced on 7 September 2021 and is being implemented at the earliest opportunity to increase funds for the National Health Service.  4. Detailed proposal  The transitional increase to the main and additional rates of National Insurance contributions will take effect from 6 April 2022 and will last for the 2022 to 2023 tax year only. The new Health and Social Care Levy will take effect from 6 April 2023.  4.2 Current law  The Social Security Contributions and Benefit Act 1992 (and Northern Ireland equivalent) sets out the various National Insurance contributions that employees, employers and self-employed individuals are liable for. Section 5 provides for primary and secondary Class 1 National Insurance contributions (employees and employers), Section 10 provides for Class 1A National Insurance contributions, section 10A provides for Class 1B National Insurance contributions (employers) and Section 15 provides for Class 4 National Insurance contributions (self-employed).  4.3 Proposed revisions  The Health and Social Care Levy Bill will provide for a 1.25% levy which is payable on an amount of earnings or profits on which an employee, employer or self-employed individual is already liable to pay a qualifying National Insurance contribution (Class 1, 1A, 1B and 4 NICs). For administrative purposes, the levy will operate in the same way as National Insurance contributions so the Bill will apply National Insurance contributions legislation to the levy.  The new Bill will stipulate how the proceeds from the new Health and Social Care Levy will be used.  The Bill will also make transitional provisions that will amend Part 1 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 (and the Northern Ireland equivalent) for the 2022-23 tax year and apply a temporary 1.25 percentage point increase to each of the qualifying National Insurance contribution rates.  4.4 Summary of impacts  4.5 Exchequer impact (£bn)  2020 to 2021 2021 to 2022 2022 to 2023 2023 to 2024 2024 to 2025 2025 to 2026 empty empty empty empty empty empty  The final costing will be subject to scrutiny by the Office for Budget Responsibility, and will be set out at the Budget.  4.6 Economic impact  The measure is anticipated to have a significant macroeconomic impact, with consequences including but not limited to for earnings, inflation and company profits. Behavioural effects are likely to be large, and these will include decisions around whether to incorporate or not, and business decisions around wage bills and recruitment.  4.7 Impact on individuals, households and families  The impact analysis that follows relates specifically to the impact of the legislative provisions outlined above. Losses are presented compared to the National Insurance contributions individuals would have faced if the rate remained unchanged.  The levy will be paid by employed and self-employed individuals earning above the Primary Threshold and Lower Profits Limit (£9,568 in 2021 to 2022 tax year). In 2022 to 2023 tax year an individual earning the median basic rate taxpayer’s income of £24,100 would be expected to pay an additional £180; and an individual earning the median higher rate taxpayer’s income of £67,100 would be expected to pay an additional £715.  Actual losses for individual taxpayers will vary according to individual circumstances.  There may be an impact on family formation, stability or breakdown as individuals, who are currently just about managing financially, will see their disposable income reduce.  4.8 Equalities impacts  It is not anticipated that there will be direct impacts on groups sharing protected characteristics as this measure applies regardless of personal circumstances or protected characteristics in so far as they are impacted by changes to National Insurance contributions.  As the levy will be a 1.25% rate on all income above the Primary Threshold, the higher an individual’s earnings, the more they will pay. Individuals with higher earnings tend to be white, male and without a disability. For the 2022 to 2023 tax year only, this measure will also only impact those below State Pension age.  In 2022 to 2023, of the 29.0 million individuals that will lose out from this measure 15.6 million (54%) are male and 13.4 million (46%) are female.  This measure is also likely to disproportionately impact individuals whose income is predominantly made up of earnings or profits, as opposed to other forms of income such as property income, pension income or savings because the Health and Social Care Levy, as well as National Insurance contributions, is not charged on those forms of income.  4.9 Impact on business including civil society organisations  This measure is expected to have a significant impact on over 1.6 million employers who will be required to introduce this change. One-off costs will include familiarisation with the change and could also include updating software or systems to reflect the change. A further one-off cost could include updating employee payroll records to reflect this change. This measure will also impact payroll software providers who will have one-off cost of familiarisation and will also be required to update software to reflect this change, the cost of which may be passed onto customers.  Customer experience is expected to remain broadly the same as this measure does not significantly alter how employers interact with HMRC. This measure is not expected to impact civil society organisations.  4.10 Operational impact (£m) (HMRC or other)  The introduction of the levy from April 2023, and the transitional arrangements for the 2022 to 2023 tax year, will require changes to HM Revenue and Custom’s IT systems. There will also be extra staff costs supporting customers and ensuring compliance with the new system. Those costs are currently being quantified.  4.11 Other impacts  Other impacts have been considered and none have been identified.  4.12 Monitoring and evaluation  The measure will be monitored through information collected from National Insurance and Levy receipts.  4.13 Further advice  If you have any questions about this change, please contact the National Insurance contributions Policy Team at nics.correspondence@hmrc.gov.uk.  4.14 Declaration  Rt Hon Jesse Norman MP, Financial Secretary to the Treasury has read this tax information and impact note and is satisfied that, given the available evidence, it represents a reasonable view of the likely costs, benefits and impacts of the measure.",Health and Social Care Levy,true

The vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE will initially be the only one used for the third doses, meaning individuals who have received either of the other two types used in Japan -- Moderna Inc. and AstraZeneca Plc. -- will need to ""mix and match.""  The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare panel also said individuals will in principle need to wait eight months between their second and third shots, though local governments can shorten the interval to six months if they deem it necessary, for example to curb an ongoing surge in infections.  Booster shots have proven effective in preventing the decline of protection against infection and severe symptoms over time, with the United States offering them since late September.  Prime Minister Fumio Kishida had vowed to begin administering third doses within the year, with the program set to start with medical personnel before expanding to the elderly in January.  Individuals aged 18 and older will be eligible for the booster shots and those with preexisting conditions or working in high-risk professions will be especially encouraged to get them.  Local governments will begin mailing out vouchers for the booster shots later this month.  Only messenger RNA vaccines developed by Pfizer or Moderna will be administered, regardless of the type individuals received as first and second doses. Moderna's vaccine, however, has yet to be approved by the health ministry for third shots.  The AstraZeneca vaccine, which uses different technology, will undergo further analysis before being used as a booster shot.  According to the Japanese government, more than 75 percent of the country's population has been fully vaccinated, a higher rate than most of the other members of the Group of Seven nations, despite the country getting off to a slow start. More than 78 percent have received at least one shot.  Related coverage:  Over 90% of main Japan cities to finish COVID vaccine rollout by Nov.

254,264800977996672429377733770120049387899,"Campaigners say people from Caribbean countries such as Jamaica appear to be disproportionately targeted for deportation from the UK if they commit crimes, according to Home Office data obtained by the Guardian following a yearlong freedom of information battle.  One pressure group said the high percentage of Jamaican nationals deported was particularly glaring given their greater likelihood of having family ties in the UK, and warned that it could further erode the trust of people affected by the Windrush scandal.  Nationals from Ghana and Nigeria are also removed significantly more often than the overall average, the figures show. Another set of controversial Home Office chartered deportation flights to both countries are expected next month.  Campaigners also expressed alarm after the statistics showed particularly high levels of people deported to Albania and Vietnam, which have notable issues with human trafficking connected to organised crime.  Under the UK Borders Act 2007, foreign nationals who are jailed for a single offence for at least 12 months will normally be considered for deportation on their release, with exceptions under human rights rules – for example, having children in the UK, and for people who have been trafficked.  A comparison of Ministry of Justice (MoJ) and Home Office data between 2015 and 2020 showed that once people from European Economic Area countries were excluded, as they are not covered by the act, an average of 65% of overseas nationals jailed for at least 12 months were deported.  For Jamaican nationals, this proportion rose to 75%, however, despite the much greater likelihood of their having significant ties to the UK. For other former British colonies in the Caribbean, such as Trinidad and Tobago, and St Lucia, the rates were higher still.  The statistics also showed that 90% of Nigerian nationals were deported, and 76% of those from Ghana. For Albanians, the rate was 90%, and for Vietnamese nationals 84%.  Both sets of data were obtained under freedom of information laws. While the MoJ supplied the information within weeks, the Home Office refused, saying that to do so would be “likely to prejudice diplomatic relations between the UK and a foreign government”, and could hamper the operation of immigration controls.  The Guardian appealed to the Information Commissioner’s Office, which ruled against the Home Office, calling the department’s arguments “vague” and “generic”, and noting that no attempt had been made to substantiate them. “The commissioner will not accept at face value assertions made by a public authority that, in her view, require a proper and fuller explanation,” the ruling stated.  Bishop Desmond Jaddoo, chair of the Windrush National Organisation, said he was dispirited but not surprised by the statistics. “This bears out what we’ve been saying for a very long time – that particularly Jamaicans have disproportionately fallen foul of immigration regulations,” he said.  “I believe the British government are disregarding family lives. I understand people have committed crimes, but they are being punished twice – they have served their time in prison, many have gone back to their families and children, some have spent years out of prison, and then they’re deported.”  Jaddoo said the disproportionality risked further alienating people from Windrush communities: “We’re talking here about trust and confidence, about people being able to come forward. People are still worried.”  Bella Sankey, the director of Detention Action, which campaigns over deportation flights, said: “The Home Office claims its deportation system is not discriminatory, but these statistics reveal the truth. As we’ve long suspected, black-majority, former British colonies like Nigeria, Ghana and Jamaica are targeted, along with countries where trafficking is prevalent, like Albania and Vietnam.  “How are these decisions made? Are these the easy targets for a department that cares little for black lives and trafficking survivors?”  Deportations, particularly to Jamaica, have become an increasingly contentious issue in recent months. Some of those removed have lived in the UK since they were children. Under a deal agreed late last year between the UK and Jamaica, the Home Office will no longer remove Jamaican nationals who first moved to the UK before the age of 12.  A Home Office spokesperson said: “The public rightly expects us to remove those who have no right to be in the UK, including dangerous foreign criminals. These figures show the ongoing work to remove those who have received at least a 12-month sentence in the UK for committing crimes such as sexual offences, drug dealing and arson.  “We regularly operate charter flights, but also use other available routes such as regularly scheduled flights to remove criminals from the UK – we do not target specific countries. Returns, including deportations as well as voluntary departures, to Jamaica constituted less than 1% of all returns between January 2015 and March 2020.”  The headline and text of this article were amended on 24 August 2021 to make clear that the claim of disproportionate “targeting” has been made by campaigners.","Disproportionate ‘targeting’ of Jamaicans for deportation from UK, data suggests",true

256,269437094777859855526235773701930631244,"WSTA scores historic win as Government announce scrapping of arduous and unnecessary wine paperwork  The Wine and Spirit Trade Association has won a significant post-Brexit victory, for its members and consumers, after government has agreed to scrap wine-specific paperwork on imports from across the globe.  Following the referendum, the WSTA started a campaign calling for Government to do away with the time consuming and costly VI-1 forms on imported wine.  The historic removal of this unnecessary red tape will mean the UK’s 33 million wine consumers will be able to continue to enjoy the vast range of imported wines without additional costs.  After leaving the EU the WSTA warned that the introduction of the new forms and laboratory test demands would have brought wine imports from the EU to a standstill and cost the industry approximately £70 million. Today’s decision to scrap all wine import certificates, not just those for EU wine, will see even greater savings – approximately £100m.  Defra’s announcement that wine-specific VI-1 forms will now not be required for imports from the EU and beyond, is a huge boost for producers, importers and consumers – 99% of wine consumed in the UK is imported, with 55% of that coming from the EU.  The UK wine industry contributes around £11 billion every year in economic activity and employs 130,000 people across the supply chain. The scrapping of these non-tariff barriers, championed by the WSTA will prevent the price of a bottle of wine increasing by around 13p.  If the plans to introduce VI-1s to wine coming in from the EU had come into play, imports would have required laboratory analysis – a process the WSTA estimates would have cost about £330 per shipment and may well have put off smaller producers from sending their wines to the UK reducing consumer choice.  Miles Beale, Chief Executive of the Wine and Spirit Trade Association, said:  “This is a truly historic moment for the UK’s world-leading wine trade. We have spent more than two years campaigning relentlessly to avoid the introduction of new import certificates for EU wine imports on the one hand and scrapping the unnecessary and costly VI-1 wine paperwork for on-EU wine imports on the other. The first would have cost the UK wine industry some £70m [annually], reduced consumer choice and bumped up prices. The second will increase those savings to over £100 million. It’s a truly fantastic outcome.  “It is heartening to know that Government trust the WSTA’s advice and are listening to the concerns of business, particularly SMEs. This is a major win for wine lovers and the UK wine industry. I am sure corks will be popping across the globe in celebration of this most welcome news.”  James Miles, Chairman and Managing Director (Co-Founder) at Liv-ex Ltd said:  “I cannot overstate how important today’s announcement is to the UK wine industry. The WSTA and its members have been campaigning hard to stop UK officials from imposing unnecessary import regulations on the wine trade.  “Government has shown it is in tune with business by taking this once in a lifetime opportunity. By removing these unnecessary and costly non-tariff barriers to trade it has re-set our trading arrangements with the rest of the world in a way that that will enhance the UK’s leading position in the global wine trade.”",WSTA scores historic win as Government announce scrapping of arduous and unnecessary wine paperwork,true
257,4826262642585027064268759330381904252,"11. Strengths and limitations  Pre-release data  HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) grants pre-release access to official statistics publications. As this is a joint release, and in accordance with the HMRC policy, pre-release access has been granted to a number of people to enable the preparation of statistical publications and ministerial briefing. Further details, including a list of those granted access, can be found on HMRC’s website.  The Bank of England was granted exceptional pre-release access to this bulletin and accompanying tables at 1:00pm on Friday 11 March 2022 so that the data were available for the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting held on that day. See exchange of letters requesting exceptional pre-release access so that data are available for discussion at the MPC.  Experimental Statistics status  This is a joint experimental release between HMRC and the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The existing monthly publications produced by the ONS remain the primary National Statistics for the labour market. The intention is that these new statistics will also be updated on a monthly basis.  The release is classed as Experimental Statistics as the methodologies used to produce the statistics are still in their development phase. This does not mean that the statistics are of low quality, but it does signify that the statistics are new and still being developed. As the methodologies are refined and improved, there may be revisions to these statistics.  Rather than waiting until the development work has been completed, the statistics are being published now to involve potential users in developing the statistics. We hope that this encourages users to provide us with their thoughts and suggestions on how useful the statistics are and what can be done to improve them. You can send us your comments by email.  More information about Experimental Statistics, including when they should be used and the differences between them and National Statistics, is available.  Strengths of the data  As Pay As You Earn (PAYE) Real Time Information (RTI) data cover the whole population, rather than a sample of people or companies, we are able to use these to produce estimates for geographic areas and other more detailed breakdowns of the population. The methods for producing such breakdowns are under development and we expect to include further statistics in a future release. These statistics can help inform decision-making across the country. They also have the potential to provide more timely estimates than existing measures.  These statistics also have the potential to replace some of those based on surveys, which could reduce the burden on businesses needing to fill in statistical surveys.  Imputation and revisions  A limitation of the calendarisation used is that the figures for pay and numbers of employees in month t depend on payments made in month t plus 1. This means only around 80% of the data used in the calculation on month t statistics are available at the end of each month.  Rather than wait until all those remaining payment returns have been received, we have decided to produce a timelier measure of numbers of employees and median pay by imputing the values for missing returns. The data on which the statistics are based were extracted at the beginning of March 2022, which means around 1% to 2% of the data for January 2022 are imputed, while around 15% of the data for the “flash” February 2022 data are imputed. As a result, the figures in future releases will be updated as new payment returns are received, and the imputation payments can be replaced with actual data.  Starting with the December 2020 publication, we introduced a revisions policy. For each publication, we incorporate new input data only for the latest two tax years. In May of each year, new input data will be incorporated for the whole data time series. The benefit of introducing this revisions policy is that we can use the processing time saved to produce and publish more detailed breakdowns.  Seasonal adjustment  The seasonal adjustment applied in this bulletin follows established best practice. This approach assumes that any seasonal patterns remain broadly consistent over time. If the seasonal pattern changes in strength, this will be represented as greater volatility in the seasonally adjusted figures.

Getting a COVID-19 vaccine gives most people a high level of protection against COVID-19 and can provide added protection for people who already had COVID-19. One study showed that, for people who already had COVID-19, those who do not get vaccinated after their recovery are more than 2 times as likely to get COVID-19 again than those who get fully vaccinated after their recovery.  All COVID-19 vaccines currently available in the United States are effective at preventing COVID-19. Getting sick with COVID-19 can offer some protection from future illness, sometimes called “natural immunity,” but the level of protection people get from having COVID-19 may vary depending on how mild or severe their illness was, the time since their infection, and their age.  Getting a COVID-19 vaccination is also a safer way to build protection than getting sick with COVID-19. COVID-19 vaccination helps protect you by creating an antibody response without you having to experience sickness. Getting vaccinated yourself may also protect people around you, particularly people at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Getting sick with COVID-19 can cause severe illness or death, and we can’t reliably predict who will have mild or severe illness. If you get sick, you can spread COVID-19 to others. You can also continue to have long-term health issues after COVID-19 infection.

Further work remains underway to establish the level of protection against mortality from the Delta variant. However, as with other variants, this is expected to be high.  The analysis included 14,019 cases of the Delta variant – 166 of whom were hospitalised – between 12 April and 4 June, looking at emergency hospital admissions in England.  Public Health England ( PHE ) has previously published analysis showing that one dose is 17% less effective at preventing symptomatic illness from the Delta variant, compared to Alpha, but there is only a small difference after 2 doses.  Health and Social Care Secretary, Matt Hancock said:  Our UK vaccination programme continues at pace and has already saved thousands of lives. It is our way out of this pandemic. This evidence of the effectiveness of 2 doses against variants shows just how crucial it is to get your second jab. If you have had your first dose but haven’t booked your second yet – please do so. It will help save lives and boost us on the road to recovery.  Dr Mary Ramsay, Head of Immunisation at PHE , said:  These hugely important findings confirm that the vaccines offer significant protection against hospitalisation from the Delta variant. The vaccines are the most important tool we have against COVID-19. Thousands of lives have already been saved because of them. It is absolutely vital to get both doses as soon as they are offered to you, to gain maximum protection against all existing and emerging variants.  Vaccines Minister, Nadhim Zahawi said:  It is extremely encouraging to see today’s research showing that vaccines are continuing to help break the link between hospitalisation and the Delta variant after one dose, and particularly the high effectiveness of 2 doses.

While powerful drugs do have side effects, many said, they remembered no fatal reactions. At Incarnation, Dr. Nicholas said, no child had died of a reaction and ""no child ever had an unexpected side effect.""  He said that, with one exception, no children had been included in the trials without ""absolute proof"" by advanced testing methods that they were infected and not simply carrying their mother's antibodies. He said the exception was a trial that proved that by giving AZT to pregnant, infected women and then to their newborns in the first six weeks of life it was possible to sharply reduce the rate of H.I.V. transmission from mother to child. He called that study ""the most important clinical trial in the history of AIDS.""  In response to the charge by some critics that hospitals should have appointed independent guardians for each child, doctors said the federal regulations require advocates only when a trial holds ""no prospect of direct benefit"" for the child. Several said their hospitals appointed advocates anyway.  ""This isn't Tuskegee, it never was Tuskegee, it never will be Tuskegee,"" Dr. Borkowsky said. ""This is something that has been blown totally out of proportion by, I think, people who are vying for office and looking for something to get them into the news.""  Columbia University Medical Center, which was found by federal officials to have ""failed to have obtain sufficient information"" in approving the participation of foster children in four trials, has acknowledged what it called a need to improve ""how information is collected and decisions documented.""

Mr. Mattingly, the agency's commissioner, said, ""I would far rather be having this dialogue than one in which we tried to explain why my predecessors -- confronted by a medical epidemic of unforeseen magnitude -- did not do everything possible to get these children access to promising medication because they were in foster care.

Because information about COVID-19 changes rapidly, we encourage you to visit the websites of the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC), World Health Organization (WHO), and your state and local government for the latest information.  In summer 2021, people were feeling some hope—or at least cautious optimism—that the pandemic could recede to the background, although there was still the threat that new mutations of the COVID-19 virus could bring it back, and it might be even stronger.  That’s when the Delta variant surfaced in the United States. First identified in India in late 2020, Delta swept rapidly through that country and Great Britain before reaching the U.S., where it quickly surged and became the predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant, accounting for more than 99% of COVID-19 cases (at the time) and leading to an overwhelming increase in hospitalizations in some states. (Omicron replaced Delta as the predominant variant, but in March 2022, the CDC still included Delta on its list of variants of concern in the U.S., even though it accounted for 0% of cases in the U.S. at that time.)  Delta was believed to be more than twice as contagious as previous variants, and studies have shown it to be more likely than the original virus to put infected people in the hospital. People who were not vaccinated were most at risk, and the highest spread of cases and severe outcomes happened in places with low vaccination rates.  Inci Yildirim, MD, PhD, a Yale Medicine pediatric infectious diseases specialist and a vaccinologist, wasn’t surprised by Delta's progression. “All viruses evolve over time and undergo changes as they spread and replicate,” she said.  People who are fully vaccinated against the coronavirus continued to have strong protection against COVID-19 compared to those who weren’t, but there were enough questions about Delta to lead the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to advise additional precautions, including mask guidelines regardless of vaccination status and recommendations for booster shots.  While most Delta infections have been in people who have not had a vaccine, data also showed the variant to have increased transmissibility even among some vaccinated people.

(Suzette Wenger/LNP/LancasterOnline via AP)  Amish buggies are parked at a home along the New Holland Road south of New Holland for a wedding celebration on March 17, 2020. The administrator of a medical center in the heart of the Amish community in New Holland Borough estimates as many as 90% of Plain families have since had at least one family member infected with COVID-19, and that this religious enclave achieved what no other community in the United States has: herd immunity. (Suzette Wenger/LNP/LancasterOnline via AP)  LANCASTER, Pa. (AP) —  Late last spring a COVID-19 wave tore through the Plain community when they resumed church services, infecting an untold number of Amish and Mennonites in Lancaster County.  The administrator of a medical center in the heart of the Amish community in New Holland Borough estimates as many as 90% of Plain families have since had at least one family member infected, and that this religious enclave achieved what no other community in the United States has: herd immunity.  “So, you would think if COVID was as contagious as they say, it would go through like a tsunami; and it did,” said Allen Hoover, an Old Order Mennonite and administrator of the Parochial Medical Center, a clinic that primarily serves the Plain community.  ADVERTISEMENT  Public health officials and epidemiologists did not dispute the widespread outbreak Hoover described. But they voiced concern that a misplaced perception of herd immunity in a population that makes up 8% of Lancaster County may compromise the effort to turn the tide on the pandemic.  As Hoover observed, faith in herd immunity has prompted members of the Plain community to relax on key mitigation efforts such as masking and social distancing, and they may see little reason to be vaccinated.  Additionally, it is unknown whether achieving herd immunity last year would be beneficial now.  Six infectious disease experts with whom LNP ′ LancasterOnline spoke expressed unease with a reliance on the notion the Plain community had achieved herd immunity here. And they pointed out that if not the case, past infections and existing antibodies may provide limited protection.  “Herd immunity is only true at a given point in time,” said Eric Lofgren, an infectious disease epidemiologist at Washington State University. “It’s not a switch that once it gets thrown, you’re good. It’ll wear off.”  This collision of science and personal experience could leave Lancaster County vulnerable just as county health officials seek to make progress vaccinating residents against COVID-19.  “You can have a long period where you think everything is OK, but you have this whole population that’s susceptible,” said David Lo, professor of biomedical sciences and senior associate dean of research at the University of California, Riverside.  Lo added, “All it takes is one person who’s contagious to give you this sudden outbreak.”  ‘There’s a real risk of having an outbreak’  Hoover agreed with these epidemiologists.  ADVERTISEMENT  He acknowledged that face masks and social distancing have been critical for mitigating the spread of COVID-19; he wears a face covering when interacting with non-Amish. But he also knows many in the Plain community don’t take the same precautions.  “As a general rule, we want to respect those around us,” said Hoover, who has been the medical center’s administrator since 2004. But because of perceived immunity, Hoover said, the Plain community believes public health directives don’t “apply to us.”  It’s a perspective Hoover understands, but doesn’t share.  “We should be careful that we’re not the cause of it spreading,” Hoover said.  The Parochial Medical Center is not the only medical provider that caters to the Plain community, but with 33,000 active patients, it is arguably the largest.  The Plain community in Lancaster County, which includes both Amish and Mennonites, is not insignificant. Combined, it represents nearly 8% of the county’s population of just more than 545,000 residents, according to estimates from Elizabethtown College’s Young Center for Anabaptist and Pietist Studies.  The dearth of COVID-19 testing among the Plain doesn’t just mean a lack of scientific certainty.  “The reason it’s important is because it’s unlikely that 100% have had the disease,” said David Dowdy, a professor in the epidemiology department at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.  Under the right conditions, a single infected individual can trigger an outbreak.  Take what happened at Disneyland.  Two decades ago, measles was declared eradicated in the United States because of an effective national vaccination campaign. But that didn’t stop an outbreak from infecting 150 people in seven states, Mexico and Canada in 2014, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The outbreak was attributed to unvaccinated children.  The implication is this: If an outbreak of a highly contagious disease for which there is a proven vaccine could happen at the Happiest Place on Earth, it can happen in Lancaster County.  An outbreak among the Plain would impact the wider community because while these religious sects are insular, they are not isolated. The Plain mingle with the English, as they refer to their non-Amish neighbors, at grocery stores, their places of business and other public places.  “There could easily still be pockets of the (Plain) community who have not been infected, and if they’re infected, there’s a real risk of having an outbreak,” Dowdy said.  ‘It was bad here in the spring’  The Plain community followed the example of its English neighbors and shuttered schoolhouses and canceled biweekly church services when the novel coronavirus threatened to overwhelm Pennsylvania’s health-care system last spring.  Initially, compliance with public health directives was about not being offensive to non-Amish neighbors, Hoover said.  But as the pandemic wore on, messages from skeptical lawmakers and English neighbors suggested that the virus wasn’t a big concern.  For example, back in early May, a number of Lancaster County elected officials — including state Sen. Ryan Aument, a Mount Joy Republican — said they would join a handful of other counties to defy Gov. Tom Wolf’s stay-at-home orders to save the local economy, which had been battered in the shutdown.  County Commissioner Josh Parsons, a Republican, challenged the legal basis for requiring face masks. And state Rep. David Zimmerman, a Republican who represents a large swath of eastern Lancaster County, home to a large number of Plain, criticized the governor’s handling of the pandemic.  “The Amish are a distinct group, but they also respond, in many ways, like many rural Lancastrians,” said Steve Nolt, interim director of the Young Center. “I think there was a lot of non-Amish influence on the Amish.”  As their English neighbors resumed pre-pandemic activities, the Plain community did as well, Nolt and others said.  By late April, when Pennsylvania was still under stay-at-home orders, the Plain community had resumed worship services, where they shared communion cups and holy kisses, a church greeting among believers.  Infections quickly followed.  “It was bad here in the spring; one patient right after another,” said Pam Cooper, a physician’s assistant at the Parochial Medical Center.  Just how deep into the community the infections spread is impossible to know. Hoover speculated that among those displaying symptoms, fewer than 10% consented to be tested.  In late April and early May, when Hoover said the virus ran unimpeded through the Plain community, the county’s positivity rate — the percent of positive tests — exceeded 20%, its highest of the pandemic, according to Covid Act Now, a nonprofit that provides local disease data. (Last year, the World Health Organization recommended governments use a rate of 5% or lower for two weeks as the threshold for reopening.)  If Hoover’s assessment is accurate, and if more Plain patients had been tested, the positivity rate could very well have been higher.  While so few were tested, many exhibited all the symptoms that have become so emblematic of the disease.  Cooper estimated the medical center saw — on average — nearly a dozen infections a day, or roughly 15% of the patients it serves daily.  The disease, as has been true in the wider community, knew no boundaries. Hoover became infected in November; at least one of his children was infected twice.  “It really went through pretty quick, in a few weeks,” Cooper said.  The number of patients ebbed in the summer before picking up again in the fall, although not at nearly the rate as was seen in the spring.  Cases now are rare. Hoover said Tuesday that the center hasn’t had a patient present with COVID-19 symptoms in roughly six weeks.  ‘You’d actually have to test the herd’  Epidemiologists from the University of Pittsburgh, Washington State, Johns Hopkins, Emory and the University of California all said a widespread outbreak leading to herd immunity in the Plain community would be rare, but possible.  “It’s extremely unusual,” Lofgren, at Washington State University, said of herd immunity to COVID-19. “It would be the first general population in the United States that’s done it.”  Significant outbreaks have been identified elsewhere.  The CDC, for example, studied COVID-19 outbreaks among smaller Amish communities in rural Ohio and Indiana.  As the CDC has noted, the Amish emphasis on strong social bonds and religious gatherings posed a unique public health challenge during the pandemic.  Unlike the outbreak Hoover described in Lancaster County, however, the Ohio and Indiana communities conducted testing.  “They really contributed to a lot of spread of COVID in the community,” said Shirley Bixby, director of nursing for the Ashland County Board of Health in northeastern Ohio. “It was quite nerve-wracking.”  In Indiana, COVID-19 infections were so common among the Amish that residents believe most had been exposed.  At the height of the summer outbreak, seven out of 10 COVID-19 tests came back positive, said Dr. Daniel N. Kragt, a physician at Dayspring Christian Health Care in Middlebury, Indiana.  Dayspring is a cash-only provider in the middle of the Amish community, about 35 miles east of South Bend.  For all the tests Kragt conducted, about 40% of Amish patients declined.  Making scientific conclusions about immunity is difficult, Kragt noted, because very often “the herd doesn’t want” to be tested.  “To say you have herd immunity, you’d actually have to test the herd,” Kragt said.  ‘Plenty’ of death certificates  COVID-19 has been devastating to Pennsylvania seniors, with nine out of every 10 fatalities among those 60 and older. In Lancaster County, 96% of COVID-19 fatalities as of March 17 — 926 of 968 — have been people age 60 or older.  The same appears to be true for the elderly in the Plain community, as Hoover estimated most deaths were 70 and older.  Cooper said she signed “plenty” of death certificates during that time.  But the death toll may never be known.  Lancaster County Coroner Dr. Stephen Diamantoni identified fewer than a dozen deaths in the Plain community, an estimate he derived at by using decedent location and last name.  Virus-related deaths, Cooper speculated, were likely listed as pneumonia.  Diamantoni does not dispute this.  “People have to die from something,” Diamantoni said. “If they don’t want any intervention done, these people could slip under the radar.”  Even if more virus testing had been done, it’s unlikely the public would know much more about the disease’s impact. That’s because demographic information collected by health departments — such as race and ethnicity — does not include religion.  The fatalities have not gone unnoticed.  A contributor to The Diary, a monthly newspaper published in Kirkwood with Amish reports on crops, births, deaths, weddings and ordinations across the United States, tallied the annual number of obituaries since 2015.  “As you can see, the number of deaths this year is 100 count higher than any of the five previous years,” Joas D. Troyer, of Hestand, Kentucky, wrote in January’s edition. “This may give us a good idea how many people died from coronavirus.”  No ‘magic number’  Herd immunity — either through infection or vaccination — has been touted as the way back to normal.  “The only true herd immunity that we can bring as a community is for people to be vaccinated,” said Alice Yoder, executive director of Community Health at Penn Medicine Lancaster General Health.  Because immunologists don’t yet know what the threshold is for COVID-19 immunity, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, has said the coronavirus could require vaccination rates as high as 90%.  “The key is that there is not necessarily a magic number,” said Dowdy, at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.  The lack of infection data on the notoriously private Plain community makes proving or disproving whether Anabaptists (a Christian community of which Amish and Mennonites are a part) achieved herd immunity impossible 11 months later. Testing could be conducted now, but the absence of antibodies — Dowdy and other experts said — doesn’t mean the lack of infection.  As the United States races to stay ahead of virus mutations, the more pressing issue — these experts said — was vaccine hesitancy. As of March 16, there were two other mutations in Pennsylvania: 68 cases of the UK variant and one South African case, according to the CDC.  “The higher the vaccination in the (Plain) community, the better it will be for the entire community,” said Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious diseases physician and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.  Despite lower childhood vaccination rates among the Amish, there is no religious prohibition, said Nolt, at Elizabethtown College, who has written 14 books about the Amish.  In a 2017 doctoral study that examined Amish perceptions in Lancaster County, Cooper found the majority had a positive attitude toward immunizations and roughly six in 10 surveyed were likely to vaccinate their children.  As Cooper noted in her study, three out four of those she surveyed said they had never discussed vaccination with their health care provider.  “Providers are missing many opportunities to discuss vaccines with Amish parents,” wrote Cooper, at the Parochial Medical Center.  ‘God helps those who help themselves’  Vaccine efforts among the Plain community could prove challenging.  “I think it will be a very hard sell,” Hoover said.  The Amish have been persuaded to embrace mass vaccination efforts before, most notably after a polio outbreak in 1979 and a rash of measles in 1991. This has left health officials hopeful the Anabaptists will respond again.  The Pennsylvania Amish Safety Committee and other partnerships will be crucial to outreach efforts that have already begun. Comprised of five elected Old Order Amish men, the committee provides safety information and has helped spearhead issues such as the 2011 effort to cover holes in haylofts after emergency room doctors encountered a number of Plain sect children who had fallen through.  The goal, Lancaster General’s Yoder said, is to achieve a vaccination rate protective of the entire community.  “Of course,” Yoder said, “there might be some concern that we don’t reach that.”  The way Dr. Holmes Morton sees it, these religious sects must take responsibility for getting vaccinated to protect their Lancaster County neighbors.  “I just think the Plain community has to get involved in a public-health sense,” said Morton, founder of the Central Pennsylvania Clinic in Belleville, Mifflin County.  Morton, who first created the Clinic for Special Children in Strasburg, is renowned for his pioneering work on genetic diseases among Plain children.  “Just because you’re Plain doesn’t mean you’re exempt,” Morton said. “God helps those who help themselves.”  Sidebar:  Plain community population  The Plain community includes Amish and Old Order Mennonites.  With a population of 40,525 people, the Lancaster Amish settlement is the largest in the United States and extends into Chester County and northern Maryland.  Roughly 88%, or more than 35,000 adults and children in this settlement, live within the borders of Lancaster County.  Old Order Mennonites primarily consist of three groups — the Groffdale Mennonite Conference, the Stauffer Mennonite Church and Reidenbach Mennonites — with a combined population of about 5,700.  Together, these religious sects represent nearly 8% of the 545,000 people living in Lancaster County.  Source: Elizabethtown College Young Center for Anabaptist and Pietist Studies, U.S. Census Bureau  Sidebar:  What is herd immunity?  Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient number of people have immunity to a disease to prevent a virus from finding new hosts, thereby protecting the wider population. Immunity can be achieved either through recovering from an infection or vaccination.  So, why is it important?  Herd immunity is the only way to eradicate COVID-19.  The more transmissible a disease, the higher the percentage of a population needs to be immune. Initially, scientists estimated 60% to 70% of the population needed to acquire resistance to provide herd immunity.  It’s difficult to know the precise threshold for the novel coronavirus.  Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, late last year began moving the goal post, adjusting that estimate up to as high as 90%.  The reasons?  Viruses constantly mutate and COVID-19 is becoming more transmissible.  Because the elderly and other individuals with compromised immune systems cannot risk a COVID-19 infection, herd immunity will be crucial to protecting these groups.  ___  Online:  https://bit.ly/313ygjX",90 percent of Plain community households hit by COVID-19,true
263,226158234390039727489358333942747365218,"DURHAM, N.C. -- The widespread use of masks in schools can effectively prevent COVID-19 transmission and provide a safe learning environment, two Duke scholars said Wednesday.  Danny Benjamin, M.D., and Kanecia Zimmerman, M.D., were co-chairs of the Duke-led ABC Science Collaborative, which issued a new report Wednesday showing that North Carolina schools were highly successful in preventing the transmission of COVID-19 within school buildings.  The report found in part that masks effectively prevented COVID-19 transmission even without physical distancing in schools and on buses.  Benjamin and Zimmerman spoke to reporters Wednesday in a virtual media briefing. Watch the briefing on YouTube. Read a news story about the collaborative's findings on Duke Health's website.  Here are excerpts:  ON WHAT RESEARCH SUGGESTS FOR SCHOOL THIS FALL  Danny Benjamin  “North Carolina school districts, K-12 education and the charter schools, did an outstanding job of preventing COVID-19 transmission in schools.”  “With masking, the schools clearly can safely deliver face-to-face education for children and adults. They can have one, two or three children (per seat) on the school buses. The amount of distancing, whether it’s less than 6 feet, less than 3 feet or no distancing at all, it didn’t make any difference at all … providing there was masking in place.”  “This means that we don’t have to close schools again. We don’t have to have remote instruction. We’ve got tools that will keep children and adults safe in schools.”  Kanecia Zimmerman  “We studied districts that had 6 feet of distancing between students; 3 to 6 feet of distancing between students; and then less than 3 feet of distancing between students. Even on buses where there were one, two or three children to a bus seat. There were no differences between those three distinctions in distance. So this suggests we can have full in-person instruction with masking in place.”  “With masking in place, the secondary attack rate is really, really low. We can be successful. We don’t need to go back to remote education. We have tools in our toolbox in order to move forward.”  ON WHETHER QUARANTINING SCHOOL CHILDREN WORKS  Kanecia Zimmerman  “In the mask-on-mask environment, kids who are coming in contact with a positive person are having to quarantine for a substantial period of time. That means collectively in North Carolina we had more than 40,000 people who had to quarantine during the 10 to 12 weeks (of our study). More than 40,000 people is hundreds of thousands of school days that have been missed because of quarantine. And yet the benefit that we’re seeing is nil. It is very minimal transmission, therefore the risk to go to enhanced community spread really isn’t there. So we have missed school days without the benefit of actually controlling spread. This is something that I think we should think very carefully about as we move forward.”  ON MASKS AND ATHLETICS  Kanecia Zimmerman  “Athletics, particularly indoor athletics, can be a higher risk environment than the outdoor space. We need specific policies in place in order to protect athletes. Vaccination is extremely effective, as is masking.”  ON KIDS, ANXIETY AND SCHOOL THIS FALL  Danny Benjamin  “Some of the children are going to be anxious. The way we approach that kind of anxiety in our house – and we have four children – is if the adults will treat this as an adventure and if the adults will treat this as something that is fun and an opportunity, the children tend to respond better to that. For the older children, of course, the opportunity to be vaccinated right now really does provide a safe environment regardless of where the children might be. For the younger children, that’s a more nuanced discussion around what they might be seeing at school. But we know from the past 10 to 12 weeks that North Carolina is fully capable of preventing transmission at school.”  ON RESEARCH BEYOND NORTH CAROLINA  Kanecia Zimmerman  “There are data from Missouri and data from Utah where people have had 3 feet or no feet of distancing between children. They had masking mandates in place and were very successful in preventing transmission. This is in a setting of consistent testing of those exposed. The same data from Wisconsin, from Missouri … people have been extremely successful.”  ON WHETHER KIDS 12 AND OLDER SHOULD WEAR MASKS IN SCHOOL  Danny Benjamin  “We don’t have data from within North Carolina as to whether or not, in school in K-12, what happens when children are not masked. In other environments, however, if people are vaccinated, they are safe indoors. The vaccine brings the transmission down dramatically. For people who get infected, the rate of severe disease is reduced 90 to 95 percent. To give some context to this, a vaccinated child or adult … it’s safer for them indoors than it is for them to be around someone who has influenza. The vaccine is extraordinarily effective and makes life extraordinarily safe as it relates to COVID.”  ON MASK EFFECTIVENESS  Danny Benjamin  “In the mask-on-mask environment … the risk of death from acquiring COVID and dying from it in North Carolina this past year was less than the risk of riding to school in your parent’s automobile. We can effectively prevent morbidity and mortality from this disease, full stop. We have that capability.”  ON HOW TO GET KIDS BACK TO SCHOOL  Kanecia Zimmerman  “We know that if our goal is to reduce transmission of COVID-19 in schools, there are two effective ways to do that. 1: Vaccination. 2: Masking. In the setting of schools … the science suggests masking can be extremely effective, particularly for those who can’t get vaccinated while COVID-19 is still circulating.”  ON WORKING WITH POLICYMAKERS  Danny Benjamin  “It’s our privilege as a research group to partner with the state of North Carolina. It’s ultimately the policymakers of the state that make those decisions. They’ve got a lot of other things to consider other than just the findings we have in order to make the decisions that they need to make. Legislators from both sides of the aisle … and the House and the Senate, the governor’s office, DHHS, DPI, this is a state that has done an outstanding job – an outstanding job - with K-12 education as far as it relates to COVID-19. To my eye, we’ve done it better than any other state in the country. Our policymakers to date have done a phenomenal job in the toolkits and the legislation they put together that was bipartisan.”  Faculty Participants  Danny Benjamin, M.D.  Danny Benjamin, M.D., is a professor of pediatrics in the Duke School of Medicine and chair of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development’s Pediatric Trials Network.

By Michelle Roberts  Health editor, BBC News online Published 11 March  Image source, Getty Images  The Omicron variant has become the dominant type of coronavirus circulating in many countries, overtaking previous variants, such as Delta.  It can be contagious, even if you have been vaccinated. But current vaccines are still providing good protection against severe illness.  What is Omicron?  A variant is a slightly altered - or mutated - version of a virus. There are thousands of Covid variants around the world, which is to be expected because viruses mutate all the time.  Omicron is strikingly different from some other Covid variants, and the one that started the pandemic, because of the long list of genetic mutations it has undergone.  In particular, there are dozens of changes to the part of the virus targeted by the vaccine - the spike protein.  This could make it better at sidestepping some of the protection offered by vaccines, or past infections with Covid. Omicron does appear to be highly spreadable, even in those who have been fully jabbed.  There are several types or sublineages of Omicron - including BA.1.1.529 and BA.2 - that have slightly different mutations from each other.  The World Health Organization says mounting evidence suggests BA.2 is proving to be a bit more transmissible than the others.  Is it worse than other variants?  The evidence shows Omicron infections tend to be milder, since fewer people are getting sick enough with it to need hospital treatment compared to other variants.  That is largely down to the amount of protection or immunity that people have built against Covid from past infections and vaccination, rather than changes to the virus itself.  Even so, if it is more infectious it could lead to more deaths in an unvaccinated population.  Are current vaccines good enough?  Preliminary lab studies found two doses of Covid vaccine may not be enough, which is why some countries, including the UK, are giving people extra doses to boost their immunity.  UK research suggests boosters should provide good protection against severe illness.  As with other Covid variants, the risk remains highest for people who are elderly or who have significant underlying health conditions.  Although current vaccines may not be a perfect fit for Omicron, they are still the best line of defence against Covid.  They have cut the risk of severe illness against the other major Covid variants, including Delta, Alpha, Beta and Gamma.  Doctors say it is vital people get the recommended number of doses to gain maximum protection against existing and emerging variants.  How quickly could we get new vaccines against variants?  Updated versions of vaccines against Covid variants are already being designed and tested.  Manufacturers could scale up production quickly too, and regulators have already discussed how to fast-track the approval process.  Moderna has already said it hopes to have an Omicron booster ready by March, although lab tests in animals suggest they may offer little advantage over standard shots.  What about the other variants?  The most potentially dangerous ones are called variants of concern.  Why do variants occur?  Viruses make carbon copies of themselves to reproduce, but they aren't perfect at it. Errors creep in that change the genetic blueprint, resulting in a new version of the virus.  If this gives the virus a survival advantage, the new version will thrive.  The more chances coronavirus has to make copies of itself in us - the host - the more opportunities there are for mutations to occur.",What are the Covid variants and do vaccines still work?,true
265,81231553045874596244474538413006526699,"ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, DUSAN STANKOVIC  When SARS-CoV-2 first began spreading across the globe, not every lab was equipped to study it directly. The virus behind the current pandemic is highly pathogenic and transmissible, leading the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to require many of the same biosafety guidelines that shape the study of diseases such as tuberculosis and Ebola.  As in many moments throughout the last year, the scientific community responded by creatively adapting existing tools to the study of COVID-19. Among these, researchers turned to models of the pathogen such as pseudoviruses and chimeric viruses that can be studied safely in labs with lower biosafety level (BSL) clearance than required for studying the wildtype version, in an effort to expand the study of the novel coronavirus. Pseudoviruses don’t replicate, rendering them harmless, but by replacing their surface envelope proteins with those of SARS-CoV-2, researchers can glean insights into the ways the pathogen infects cells. A chimeric virus is made by inserting the genetic material of one virus into the genome of another, safe surrogate, and these introduced sequences are passed on when the virus replicates.  In addition to their safety, pseudoviruses are “extremely versatile in that you can . . . introduce different envelope proteins and you can introduce mutations, which is making it extremely useful for us to screen a lot of different variants,” says Carol Weiss, a virologist who heads the laboratory of immunoregulation at the US Food and Drug Administration. “If you want to introduce mutations in real viruses, it’s a whole lot more work.”  An approximation of the real thing  Pseudoviruses were first developed in the 1960s, after scientists began studying a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) isolated from cattle. In addition to replicating well in culture, they later learned that its surface protein, VSV-G, facilitates entry into all eukaryotic cells, making the virus a useful vector not only as a pseudovirus but as a ferry to deliver DNA into cells for therapeutic purposes. The first Ebola vaccine was developed using a VSV platform, and more recently, the virus has been engineered to seek out and destroy cancer cells.  HIV-based platforms, which came about in the 1980s, have since replaced VSV as the most common model for developing both pseudo- and chimeric viruses. Unlike VSV’s negative-strand RNA genome that must be transcribed once inside the cell, HIV’s positive-strand RNA genome can instantly begin translation, making pseudoviruses based on HIV faster to produce. HIV-based model viruses have now been used in many of the same applications as VSV, with scientists applying them to the study of diseases such as AIDS, SARS, MERS, and influenza.  We wanted to really validate that the tool that we generated did appear exactly, with everything we could throw at it, the same way as SARS-CoV-2. —Sean Whelan, Washington University  To harness these surrogates to study SARS-CoV-2, researchers first needed to prove that their pseudo- and chimeric viruses are viable stand-ins for the real thing. SARS-CoV-2 is a uniquely bulky virus—its genome is roughly 30 kilobases, while HIV and VSV sit around 10 kilobases—and while it is more similar to HIV, none of the three are closely related. Fortunately, both HIV and VSV appear to be compatible for making coronavirus models.  Sean Whelan, a virologist at Washington University in St. Louis, is one of many scientists who has developed a viable chimeric virus platform and quantified its performance in the face of antibodies against the real thing. To do this, he developed two complimentary assays—one for use in infectious disease laboratories with the BSL-3 clearance required to handle live SARS-CoV-2 and another for labs working under a lower, BSL-2 clearance—and studied how each virus responded to a battery of different treatments. It wasn’t enough, he says, to test the viruses’ ability to evade just one type of antibody, so he used monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies and serum from recovered COVID-19 patients—as well as a type of ACE2 decoy protein suggested as a possible therapeutic to draw the virus away from the cells’ own receptor. “We wanted to really validate that the tool that we generated did appear exactly, with everything we could throw at it, the same way as SARS-CoV-2.”  The BSL-2 assay Whelan designed uses a chimeric VSV that includes the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and produces a green fluorescent protein as a signal for infection (luciferase is also often used). Whelan exposed human cells to his chimeric virus until 100 cells had been infected. Then, he bathed the cells in each type of antibody and the decoy protein and recorded how quickly and to what extent the chimeric virus was able to escape them.  Simultaneously, Whelan’s colleague Mike Diamond, an immunologist at Washington University School of Medicine, developed a BSL-3 assay using a live clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2. Similar to Whelan’s assay, he exposed 100 infected cells to the same litany of tests and used immunostaining to track infected cells over time.  The results, published in Cell Host and Microbe in September, demonstrate that the two assays produce neutralization profiles for each exposure that align 93 percent of the time, meaning that the chimeric virus is a suitable proxy for assessing the ability of antibodies to shut down SARS-CoV-2. Many papers have published similar results, comparing their assays against wildtype coronavirus. This validation against the true virus is important, Whelan says, because a chimeric virus “looks like COVID from the outside, but it’s not COVID on the inside.”  A speedy means for tracking emerging variants  While studies involving true isolates of SARS-CoV-2 will always be the gold standard for understanding the complex dynamics of COVID-19, there are instances in which pseudo- and chimeric viruses are better choices. For one, such models are inherently more genetically stable than their wildtype counterparts. Viruses change a bit each time they interact with a new host, and individual copies within a single person might not be identical. In the lab, viruses can also evolve new mutations in response to the types of cells used to culture them. Viruses propagated in monkey cells, for example, may adopt different mutations than those cultured in human cells.  One of the key advantages is just the ease of use in the laboratory. —Carol Weiss, US Food and Drug Administration  When scientists engineer proxies of SARS-CoV-2, they can control for some of that variation by using plasmids that all contain a single clone of the spike protein. “One of the key advantages is just the ease of use in the laboratory,” the FDA’s Weiss tells The Scientist. “It’s not a mixture of mutations. We know exactly what we’re testing.”  In some instances, researchers specifically want to study new mutations to, say, see how they might change the efficacy of vaccines. Already, notable variants have emerged in the UK, South Africa, and Brazil that dampen the effectiveness of some vaccines. South Africa recently halted the rollout of AstraZeneca’s vaccine after it produced only a weak response against mild and moderate illness, and Moderna announced plans to modify the second iteration of its vaccine in an effort to remain robust against these new variants. For studying such mutations in the spike protein, pseudoviruses offer a much faster model for generating and testing new versions than the actual virus does.  See “Vaccines Versus the Mutants”  Rather than having to clone each new variant as it emerges in wildtype specimens to assess whether a vaccinated individual’s antibodies will be effective, pseudoviruses allow scientists to quickly create new models with the same mutations to run their experiments. Theodora Hatziioannou, a virologist at the Rockefeller University, says that she routinely screens as many as 1,000 pseudovirus samples within 48 hours to determine whether any are a cause for concern, a process that would take much longer were she waiting for live clinical isolates of SARS-CoV-2 bearing the same mutations. With pseudoviruses, “you are able to test a lot more samples much faster with the appropriate replicates.”  Hatziioannou’s team recently tested the blood of 20 patients who had received either the Moderna or Pfizer vaccine and identified individuals who mounted a robust antibody response to the virus. They extracted and isolated 18 unique antibodies associated with the spike protein’s receptor-binding domain (RBD) and exposed a VSV-based chimeric virus bearing the SARS-CoV-2 spike to each antibody type individually to see which mutations are selects for as the virus replicates.  Next, they engineered HIV-based pseudoviruses with each unique spike mutation that resulted from the VSV experiments and used their own neutralization assay to determine whether the mutations conferred resistance to SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. To confirm that the virus would behave the same when exposed to a cocktail of many different antibodies, as in a human body, the researchers also pitted the pseudoviruses against plasma taken from recovered patients.  Their results, shared on the preprint server bioRxiv on January 19 and recently accepted in Nature, demonstrate that many mutations do decrease the ability of neutralizing antibodies to effectively combat the virus. “In all cases, the mutations identified by the VSV [chimeric virus] were mutations that conferred resistance in the HIV pseudotype,” Hatziioannou says, although she adds that vaccines are still an important tool. When they looked specifically at mutations found in the B.1.351 and B.1.1.7 variants, first identified in South Africa and the UK, respectively, they found that the neutralizing ability “was a bit weaker than a virus without these substitutions, but the effects were overall small.”  Where pseudo- and chimeric viruses fall short  While these surrogate platforms have been useful tools for studying how SARS-CoV-2 enters our cells, there will always be a need for BSL-3 labs that can study the virus directly. “The disadvantage of using pseudotypes is that the only biological property that you’re really going to learn about coronaviruses is those properties that relate to the spike protein,” Vicente Planelles, a pathologist at the University of Utah, tells The Scientist. “As soon as we go beyond the processes that the spike is responsible for, we need a different model.”  No pseudovirus platform can fully recapitulate how the virus propagates and releases new copies of itself, for example, nor can scientists use them to study other mechanisms by which the virus circumvents the body’s immune system.  In addition, while pseudoviruses are useful for assessing the efficacy of vaccines and antibody therapies, they are less helpful with respect to evaluating other drugs that treat the severity of the disease. Remdesivir, for example, was highlighted as a promising option early in the pandemic before conflicting evidence cast its effectiveness into doubt. But the family of drugs to which remdesivir belongs, called nucleoside analogs, could prove useful in preventing extreme illness if scientists could find a better candidate. These drugs work by interfering with a virus’s ability to replicate, which pseudoviruses do not do. “If we found nucleoside analogs that work better than remdesivir, we would be in great shape,” Planelles says. “But you cannot probe that with a pseudovirus, because the gene [that the drug targets] is an internal gene that is not the spike.”",What Pseudoviruses Bring to the Study of SARS-CoV-2,true

It’s the amount of virus that should dictate the infected patient’s next steps. “It’s really irresponsible, I think, to forgo the recognition that this is a quantitative issue,” Dr. Mina said.  The PCR test amplifies genetic matter from the virus in cycles; the fewer cycles required, the greater the amount of virus, or viral load, in the sample. The greater the viral load, the more likely the patient is to be contagious.  This number of amplification cycles needed to find the virus, called the cycle threshold, is never included in the results sent to doctors and coronavirus patients, although it could tell them how infectious the patients are.  In three sets of testing data that include cycle thresholds, compiled by officials in Massachusetts, New York and Nevada, up to 90 percent of people testing positive carried barely any virus, a review by The Times found.  On Thursday, the United States recorded 45,604 new coronavirus cases, according to a database maintained by The Times. If the rates of contagiousness in Massachusetts and New York were to apply nationwide, then perhaps only 4,500 of those people may actually need to isolate and submit to contact tracing.  One solution would be to adjust the cycle threshold used now to decide that a patient is infected. Most tests set the limit at 40, a few at 37. This means that you are positive for the coronavirus if the test process required up to 40 cycles, or 37, to detect the virus.  Tests with thresholds so high may detect not just live virus but also genetic fragments, leftovers from infection that pose no particular risk — akin to finding a hair in a room long after a person has left, Dr. Mina said.",Your Coronavirus Test Is Positive.

267,105129503284257019346571062537632744153,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine for use in children ages five to 11. Pfizer’s clinical trial results indicate the vaccine is safe and effective in this age group.  This is an important development. COVID-19 infections are on the rise in children across Canada.  It is now up to Health Canada to consider the data and to decide whether to authorize this COVID-19 vaccine for children. Once it is authorized in Canada, the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) will have to decide whether to recommend vaccination for all children in this age group.  This raises the question of how this decision ought to be made.  Making an ethical decision  As a moral philosopher who has collaboratively researched ethical issues relating to the vaccination of children, I believe it is important to answer this question, for two reasons.  First, whatever the decision, the principles on which it is based — and should be based — must be clear and transparent.  Second, surprisingly little attention has been paid to this issue in Canada, despite the decision to vaccinate children being a matter of science and ethics. Science can clarify some of the costs and benefits of vaccination, but it cannot tell us which costs and benefits matter and when a cost-benefit ratio is favourable.  Fortunately, there is no need to generate a decision-making procedure from scratch. The procedure used by the United Kingdom’s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) in deciding whether to vaccinate healthy children aged 12-15 in the U.K. can provide important lessons about what not to do.  Risks and benefits  The most important factor is whether the benefits of vaccination outweigh its risks, and the degree to which the benefits outweigh the risks. In weighing these, the JCVI relied on what it called the “health perspective.”  Reasoning from this perspective, the JCVI held (in a series of public statements) that the chief benefits of vaccination against COVID-19 were the prevention of death, hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome (PIMS) or multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C).  The chief harms of vaccination were myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart, and pericarditis, inflammation of the thin sack surrounding the heart, though it said these were rare and “typically self-limiting and resolved within a short time.”  The JCVI argued that the benefits of vaccination in this age group are only “marginally greater” than the harms and that therefore vaccination would not be offered to all members of this group.  THE CANADIAN PRESS/Winnipeg Free Press-Mike Deal  NACI disagreed, but did not outline the ethical principles it relied on in recommending vaccination for children ages 12-17.  JCVI’s decision not to offer all children vaccination against COVID-19 was flawed in numerous respects. (It was later overruled by the chief medical officers of the U.K.‘s four nations.) NACI will do well to avoid these mistakes in making its decision about vaccinating children ages five to 11.  The Independent Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Independent SAGE, a group of British scientists offering independent scientific advice on the prevention of COVID-19) has raised a number of concerns about the JCVI’s decision-making process.  One concern is the way in which the JCVI calculated the benefits of vaccination, basing these calculations on risk to the population of all children of death, hospitalization, ICU admission and so on from COVID-19 infection, rather than the risks of these to children with a confirmed infection of COVID-19.  Another concern Independent SAGE raised was that the JCVI did not state which vaccine it considered when it examined the risks, a relevant concern since heart inflammation rates appear to be higher after the Moderna vaccine than after the Pfizer vaccine.  Direct and indirect benefits  Some of JVCI’s other mistakes related to value judgments, relying on the health perspective to make its decision. However, the JCVI was not consistent on what this included.  As noted, the JCVI mentioned the prevention of death, hospitalization, ICU admission and PIMS or MIS-C. These are not the only health benefits of vaccination against COVID-19. Some direct and indirect health benefits of vaccination were not clearly included.  The direct benefits include the prevention of long COVID — a condition affecting anywhere from two to 14 per cent of children infected with COVID-19 — and potential neurological and cognitive deficits caused by COVID-19 infection.  THE CANADIAN PRESS/Nathan Denette  Preventing the negative mental and physical health effects associated with school closures, limits on sporting and other such activities and physical distancing requirements are among the indirect benefits (though these were rightly noted by NACI in its recommendation to vaccinate adolescents). These health effects are important when deciding whether to vaccinate.  These are the known risks and benefits. However, the JCVI’s refusal to recommend vaccination to all children aged 12-15 was due to the uncertainties “regarding the magnitude of the potential harms” of vaccination, including myocarditis.  Although it gave considerable weight to unknown harms or uncertainties of vaccination, the JVCI did not consider potential unknown benefits of vaccination, or uncertainties about benefits. There was no reason to rule these out. Uncertainties about benefits seem to be of as much importance in thinking about the risk benefit profile of COVID-19 vaccination as uncertainties about risks. These, again, matter greatly to this decision.  The JCVI made another ethical error when it said the harms of vaccination should be given greater weight (relatively speaking) than the benefits.  There is no good reason to place a higher relative value on harms compared to benefits. Harms caused by vaccines are not worse than harms caused by COVID-19. It does not appear to be true that the rare and typically mild pericarditis or the myocarditis caused by vaccination is any worse than the pericarditis or the myocarditis caused (at greater frequency) by COVID-19 infection. This is not in line with other treatments considered for children, for which harms are not typically weighed more heavily than benefits.  The well-being perspective  It was a mistake for JCVI to make the decision about vaccination against COVID-19 in children purely on the basis of the health perspective. Health is important. But it is not the only value in the lives of children. Health is a priority because without it many other important benefits — enjoying friends, connecting with relatives, absorbing oneself in homework or music lessons — become much more difficult, if not impossible.  The JCVI mentioned the beneficial effects of vaccination on education. But it did not factor these benefits into the decision relating to vaccinating children against COVID-19.  Educational and other benefits afforded to children by vaccination matter greatly and must be factored into this decision. Moving beyond the health perspective into the well-being perspective encompasses a larger range of benefits and protections from vaccination, including safe and stable learning environments, time with extended family, sport, music performances and the many other things that make life happy and meaningful for children.  When making the decision whether to vaccinate children aged five to 11 against COVID-19, regulators in Canada must rely on both sound science and sound ethics. They must in particular consider all the health and well-being impacts of vaccination more generally; they must consider the uncertain harms and benefits of vaccination; and they must treat benefits and harms symmetrically.  Doing so will show that vaccinating children is, all things considered, beneficial.  Do you have a question about COVID-19 vaccines?

268,113257422404404448187697421125243685611,"Updated at 3:00 p.m. ET on August 23, 2021  Robert Malone—a medical doctor and an infectious-disease researcher—recently suggested that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines might actually make COVID-19 infections worse. He chuckled as he imagined Anthony Fauci announcing that the vaccination campaign was all a big mistake (“Oh darn, I was wrong!”) and would need to be abandoned. When he floated that nightmare scenario during a recent podcast interview with Steve Bannon, both men seemed almost delighted at the prospect of public-health officials and pharmaceutical companies getting their comeuppance. “This is a catastrophe,” Bannon declared, beaming at his guest. “You’re hearing it from an individual who invented the mRNA [vaccine] and has dedicated his life to vaccines. He’s the opposite of an anti-vaxxer.”  Before going any further, let’s be clear that the back-and-forth between Bannon and Malone was premised on misinformation. The vaccines have repeatedly been shown to help prevent symptomatic coronavirus infections and reduce their severity. Malone was riffing on a botched sentence in a USA Today article, one that was later deleted but not before being screenshotted and widely shared. That kind of overheated, spottily sourced conversation is par for the course on shows like Bannon’s, which traffic in a set of claims that sound depressingly familiar: The vaccines cause more harm than experts are letting on; Fauci is a liar and possibly a fascist; and the mainstream news media is either shamelessly complicit or too stupid to figure out what’s really going on.  In that alternate media universe, Robert Malone’s star is ascendant. He started popping up on podcasts and cable news shows a few months ago, presented as a scientific expert, arguing that the approval process for the vaccines had been unwisely rushed. He told Tucker Carlson that the public doesn’t have enough information to decide whether to get vaccinated. He told Glenn Beck that offering incentives for taking vaccines is unethical. He told Del Bigtree, an anti-vaccine activist who opposes common childhood inoculations, that there hadn’t been sufficient research on how the vaccines might affect women’s reproductive systems. On show after show, Malone, who has quickly amassed more than 200,000 Twitter followers, casts doubt on the safety of the vaccines while decrying what he sees as attempts to censor dissent.  Read: How mRNA technology could change the world  Wherever he appears, Malone is billed as the inventor of mRNA vaccines. It’s in his Twitter bio. “I literally invented mRNA technology when I was 28,” says Malone, who is now 61. If that’s true—or, more to the point, if Malone believes it to be true—then you might expect him to be championing a very different message in his media appearances. According to one recent study, the innovation for which he claims to be responsible has already saved hundreds of thousands of lives in the United States alone; there’s talk that it may soon lead to a round of Nobel Prizes. It’s the kind of validation that few scientists in history have ever received. Yet instead of taking a victory lap, Malone has emerged as one of the most vocal critics of his own alleged accomplishment. He’s sowed doubt about the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines on pretty much any podcast or YouTube channel that will have him.  Why is the self-described inventor of the mRNA vaccines working so hard to undermine them?  Whether Malone really came up with mRNA vaccines is a question probably best left to Swedish prize committees, but you could make a case for his involvement. When I called Malone at his 50-acre horse farm in Virginia, he directed me to a 6,000-word essay written by his wife, Jill, that lays out why he believes himself to be the primary discoverer. “This is a story about academic and commercial avarice,” it begins. The document’s tone is pointed, and at times lapses into all-caps fury. She frames her husband as a genius scientist who is “largely unknown by the scientific establishment because of abuses by individuals to secure their own place in the history books.”  The abridged version is that when Malone was a graduate student in biology in the late 1980s at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, he injected genetic material—DNA and RNA—into the cells of mice in hopes of creating a new kind of vaccine. He was the first author on a 1989 paper demonstrating how RNA could be delivered into cells using lipids, which are basically tiny globules of fat, and a co-author on a 1990 Science paper showing that if you inject pure RNA or DNA into mouse muscle cells, it can lead to the transcription of new proteins. If the same approach worked for human cells, the latter paper said in its conclusion, this technology “may provide alternative approaches to vaccine development.”  These two studies do indeed represent seminal work in the field of gene transfer, according to Rein Verbeke, a postdoctoral fellow at Ghent University, in Belgium, and the lead author of a 2019 history of mRNA-vaccine development. (Indeed, Malone’s studies are the first two references in Verbeke’s paper, out of 224 in total.) Verbeke told me he believes that Malone and his co-authors “sparked for the first time the hope that mRNA could have potential as a new drug class,” though he also notes that “the achievement of the mRNA vaccines of today is the accomplishment of a lot of collaborative efforts.”  Read: The pandemic’s wrongest man  Malone says he deserves credit for more than just sparking hope. He dropped out of graduate school in 1988, just short of his Ph.D., and went to work at a pharmaceutical company called Vical. Now he claims that both the Salk Institute and Vical profited from his work and essentially prevented him from further pursuing his research. (A Salk Institute spokesperson said that nothing in the institute’s records substantiates Malone’s allegations. The biotech company into which Vical was merged, Brickell, did not respond to requests for comment.) To say that Malone remains bitter over this perceived mistreatment doesn’t do justice to his sense of aggrievement. He calls what happened to him “intellectual rape.”  One target of Malone’s ire, the biochemist Katalin Karikó, has been featured in multiple news stories as an mRNA-vaccine pioneer. CNN called her work “the basis of the Covid-19 vaccine” while a New York Times headline said she had “helped shield the world from the coronavirus.” None of those stories mentioned Malone. “I’ve been written out of the history,” he has said. “It’s all about Kati.” Karikó shared with me an email that Malone sent her in June, accusing her of feeding reporters bogus information and inflating her own accomplishments. “This is not going to end well,” Malone’s message says.  Karikó replied that she hadn’t told anyone that she is the inventor of mRNA vaccines and that “many many scientists” contributed to their success. “I have never claimed more than discovering a way to make RNA less inflammatory,” she wrote to him. She told me that Malone referred to himself in an email as her “mentor” and “coach,” though she says they’ve met in person only once, in 1997, when he invited her to give a talk. It’s Malone, according to Karikó, who has been overstating his accomplishments. There are “hundreds of scientists who contributed more to mRNA vaccines than he did.”  Malone insists that his warning to Karikó that “this is not going to end well” was not intended as a threat. Instead, he says, he was suggesting that her exaggerations would soon be exposed. Malone views Karikó as yet another scientist standing on his shoulders and collecting plaudits that should go to him. Others have been rewarded handsomely for their work on mRNA vaccines, he says. (Karikó is a senior vice president at BioNTech, which partnered with Pfizer to create the first COVID-19 vaccine to be authorized for use last year.) Malone is not exactly living on the streets: In addition to being a medical doctor, he has served as a vaccine consultant for pharmaceutical companies.  In any case, it’s clear enough that Malone isn’t singularly responsible for mRNA vaccines. The process of achieving major scientific advancements tends to be more cumulative and complex than the apple-to-the-head stories we usually tell, but this much can be said for sure: Malone was involved in groundbreaking work related to mRNA vaccines before it was cool or profitable; and he and others who believed in the potential of RNA-based vaccines in the 1980s turned out to be world-savingly correct.  Malone may keep company with vaccine skeptics, but he insists he is not one himself. His objections to the Pfizer and Moderna shots have to do mostly with their expedited approval process and with the government’s system for tracking adverse reactions. Speaking as a doctor, he would probably recommend their use only for those at highest risk from COVID-19. Everyone else should be wary, he told me, and those under 18 should be excluded entirely. (A June 23 statement from more than a dozen public-health organizations and agencies strongly encouraged all eligible people 12 and older to get vaccinated, because the benefits “far outweigh any harm.”) Malone is also frustrated that, as he sees it, complaints about side effects are being ignored or censored in the nationwide push to increase vaccination rates.  You might very well walk away with the skewed sense, after hearing Malone speak or reading his posts, that there is a far-reaching COVID-19 cover-up and that the real threat is the vaccine rather than the virus. I’ve listened to hours of Malone’s interviews and read through the many pages of documents he’s posted. He is a knowledgeable scientist with a knack for lucid explanation. It doesn’t hurt that he looks the part with his neatly trimmed white beard, or that he has a voice that would be well suited for a meditation app. Malone is not a subscriber to the more out-there conspiracy theories regarding COVID-19 vaccines—he doesn’t, for instance, think Bill Gates has snuck microchips into syringes—and he sometimes pushes back gently when hosts like Bigtree or Beck drift into more ludicrous territory.  And yet he does routinely slip into speculation that turns out to be misleading or, as in the segment on Bannon’s show, plainly false. For instance, he recently tweeted that, according to an unnamed “Israeli scientist,” Pfizer and the Israeli government have an agreement not to release information about adverse effects for 10 years, which is hard to believe given that the country’s health ministry has already warned of a link between the Pfizer shot and rare cases of myocarditis. Malone’s LinkedIn account has twice been suspended for supposedly spreading misinformation.  Read: The mRNA vaccines are extraordinary, but Novavax is even better  His concerns are personal, too. Malone contracted COVID-19 in February 2020, and later got the Moderna vaccine in hopes that it would alleviate his long-haul symptoms. Now he believes the injections made his symptoms worse: He still has a cough and is dealing with hypertension and reduced stamina, among other maladies. “My body will never be the same,” he told me. In media appearances, he often notes that he has colleagues in the government and at universities who agree with him and are privately cheering him on. I spoke with several of these people—vaccine scientists and biotech consultants, suggested by Malone himself— and that is not what they told me. The portrait they paint of Malone is of an insightful researcher who can be headstrong. They related accounts of him, pre-pandemic, getting booted from projects because he was hard to communicate with and unwilling to compromise. (Malone has acknowledged his penchant for butting heads with fellow scientists.) And they are taken aback by his emergence as a vaccine skeptic. One called his eagerness to appear on less-than-reputable podcasts “naive,” while another said he thought Malone’s public rhetoric had “migrated from extrapolated assertions to sensational assertions.” Stan Gromkowski, a cellular immunologist who did work on mRNA vaccines in the early 1990s and views Malone as an underappreciated pioneer, put it this way: “He’s fucking up his chances for a Nobel Prize.”  It’s only in the curious world of fringe media that Malone has found the platform, and the recognition, he’s sought for so long. He talks to hosts who aren’t going to question whether he’s the brains behind the Pfizer and Moderna shots. They’re not going to quibble over whether credit should be shared with co-authors, or talk about how science is like a relay race, or point out that, absent the hard work of brilliant researchers who came before and after Malone, there would be no vaccine. He’s an upgrade over their typical guest list of chiropractors and naturopaths, and they’re perfectly happy to address him by the title he believes he’s earned: inventor of the mRNA vaccines.  The irony is that, to the audiences who tune in to those shows, the vaccines are seen as a scourge rather than a godsend. No matter how nuanced Malone might try to be, or how many qualifiers he appends to his opinions, he is egging on vaccine hesitancy at a time when hospitals in the least-vaccinated parts of the country are struggling to cope with an influx of new COVID-19 patients. If you want proof of that, scroll through the many comments from his followers thanking him for confirming their fears. Malone has finally made his mark, by undermining confidence in the very vaccine he says wouldn’t be possible without his genius. It’s a victory, of sorts, but one that he and the rest of us may come to regret.",The Vaccine Scientist Spreading Vaccine Misinformation,true
269,226098503166928101579366560340343749135,"We are outspoken about our optimism. These days, though, optimism seems to be in short supply. The headlines are filled with awful news. Every day brings a different story of political division, violence, or natural disaster. Despite the headlines, we see a world that’s getting better. Compare today to the way things were a decade or a century ago. The world is healthier and safer than ever. The number of children who die every year has been cut in half since 1990 and keeps going down. The number of mothers who die has also dropped dramatically. So has extreme poverty—declining by nearly half in just 20 years. More children are attending school. The list goes on and on. But being an optimist isn’t about knowing that life used to be worse. It’s about knowing how life can get better. And that’s what really fuels our optimism. Although we see a lot of disease and poverty in our work—and many other big problems that need to be solved—we also see the best of humanity. We spend our time learning from scientists who are inventing cutting-edge tools to cure disease. We talk to dedicated government leaders who are being creative about prioritizing the health and well-being of people around the world. And we meet brave and brilliant individuals all over the world who are imagining new ways to transform their communities. That’s our response when people ask, “How can you be so optimistic?” It’s a question we’ve been getting more and more, and we think the answer says a lot about how we view the world. This is our 10th Annual Letter, and we’re marking the occasion by answering 10 tough questions that people ask us. We will answer them as forthrightly as we can, and we hope that when you’re finished reading, you’ll be just as optimistic as we are.  TGN_CH_BO_BGChapterMenuHolder  | 1  Languages PDF Download  1. Why don’t you give more in the United States? Melinda: Our foundation spends about $500 million a year in the United States, most of it on education. That’s a lot, but it is less than the roughly $4 billion we spend to help developing countries. We don’t compare different people’s suffering. All suffering is a terrible tragedy. We do, however, assess our ability to help prevent different kinds of suffering. When we studied the global health landscape, we realized that our resources could have a disproportionate impact. We knew we could help save literally millions of lives. So that’s what we’ve tried to do. Take vaccines. We assumed that since it was possible to prevent disease for a few cents or a few dollars at most, it was being taken care of. But it turned out that we were wrong, and tens of millions of kids weren’t being immunized at all. We’ve spent $15.3 billion on vaccines over the past 18 years. And it’s been a terrific investment. Better immunization is one reason why the number of children who die has gone down by so much, from almost 10 million in 2000 to 5 million last year. That’s 5 million families that didn’t have to suffer the trauma of losing a daughter or a son, a sister or a brother. We love our country and care deeply about the people who live here, so we are also committed to fighting inequities in the United States. All the evidence, including our personal experience, suggests that education is the key to opportunity. By 2020, two-thirds of American jobs will require post-high school education or training. Since millions of American students don’t get a high-quality education, that’s the issue we’ve been focused on for the past 18 years. Our goal is for all students to go to a school that prepares them to pursue their dreams. Bill: We’ve been looking at how we might expand our work in the U.S. beyond education. We fund the U.S. Partnership on Mobility from Poverty, which is studying ways to help people move up the economic ladder. Although we travel extensively to learn about the lives of poor people in other countries, we’ve done less of that in America. So last fall, we took a trip to the South to learn more. Our trip to Atlanta in October 2017. In Atlanta, we met a single mom who told us a heartbreaking story about how she had just been evicted from her apartment for missing a rent payment while in the hospital with her newborn son. We had coffee with a few residents of an apartment complex in one of the city’s low-income neighborhoods. They showed us mold growing on the walls and ceiling of one of their homes. They told us they routinely hide their children under a bed or in the bathtub because of the sound of gunfire. It would be an understatement to say the people we met in Atlanta faced big challenges. But they were also incredibly resilient. At a Boys and Girls Club, we met a man who uses his own money to buy lunch for the kids. We talked with former prison inmates who are now holding down jobs and raising families. What we saw on this trip reinforced the importance of education, because it is ultimately about helping low-income students and students of color get the same opportunities as everyone else. The visit also made us think through other ways we could help people get out of poverty. The issues of economic mobility in America are deeply intertwined: education, employment, race, housing, mental health, incarceration, substance abuse. We haven’t decided how what we’ve been learning might affect our giving, but it has certainly had an effect on us. We will share more about our approach when we have settled on a strategy.  2. What do you have to show for the billions you’ve spent on U.S. education? Bill: A lot, but not as much as either of us would like. We made education the focus of our work in the United States because it is the key to a prosperous future, for individuals and the country. Unfortunately, although there’s been some progress over the past decade, America’s public schools are still falling short on important metrics, especially college completion. And the statistics are even worse for disadvantaged students. We support early learning and postsecondary institutions, but we started with high schools, and that’s still the area in which we invest the most. We’ve learned a lot about what works in education, but the challenge has been to replicate the successes widely. In the early 2000s, our foundation was one of the organizations that drew attention to a big flaw in the way high-school graduation rates were calculated. They were often reported at 90 percent when they were actually less than 70 percent—that is, roughly a third of students were dropping out. We funded research that identified the true graduation rate and helped build a coalition of states that agreed to use it. To help raise those graduation rates, we supported hundreds of new secondary schools. Many of them have better achievement and graduation rates than the ones they replaced or complemented. Early on, we also supported efforts to transform low-performing schools into better ones. This is one of the toughest challenges in education. One thing we learned is that it’s extremely hard to transform low-performing schools; overall they didn’t perform as well as newly created schools. We also helped the education sector learn more about what makes a school highly effective. Strong leadership, proven instructional practices, a healthy school culture, and high expectations are all key. We have also worked with districts across the country to help them improve the quality of teaching. This effort helped educators understand how to observe teachers, rate their performance fairly, and give them feedback they can act on. But we haven’t seen the large impact we had hoped for. For any new approach to take off, you need three things. First you have to run a pilot project showing that the approach works. Then the work has to sustain itself. Finally, the approach has to spread to other places. How did our teacher effectiveness work do on these three tests? Its effect on students’ learning was mixed, in part because the pilot feedback systems were implemented differently in each place. The new systems were maintained in some places, such as Memphis, but not in others. And although most educators agree that teachers deserve more-useful feedback, not enough districts are making the necessary investments and systemic changes to deliver it. To get widely adopted, an idea has to work for schools in a huge variety of settings: urban and rural, high-income and low-income, and so on. It also has to overcome the status quo. America’s schools are, by design, not a top-down system. To make significant change, you have to build consensus among a wide range of decision makers, including state governments, local school boards, administrators, teachers, and parents. Melinda: We recently announced some changes in our education work that take these lessons into account. Everything we do in education begins as an idea that educators bring to us. They’re the ones who live and breathe this work, who have dedicated their careers to improving systems that are failing many students today, especially minority students. That’s definitely true of our new strategy. We will work with networks of middle and high schools across the country to help them develop and implement their own strategies for overcoming the obstacles that keep students from succeeding. We will help these networks with the process: using key indicators of student success like grades and attendance to drive continuous learning and improvement. But the substance of the changes they make will depend on what local leaders and the available evidence say are most likely to be effective. Some networks of schools will focus on approaches that we have a lot of experience with, like stronger curricula and teacher feedback systems. Others will look at areas that are new to us, like mentoring programs to ease the difficult transitions from middle to high school and high school to college. Our role will be to support the schools as they design changes, gather and analyze data, and make adjustments over time based on what they’re learning.  3. Why don’t you give money to fight climate change? Bill: We do! Some of it involves our foundation, and some of it involves our own personal investments. Personally, we’re investing in innovations that will cut back on greenhouse gases (what’s called climate-change mitigation). The world needs new sources of reliable, affordable clean energy, but it has been dramatically underfunding the research that would produce these breakthroughs. This funding gap is different from the problems we work on at the foundation. In philanthropy, you look for problems that can’t be fixed by the market or governments. The clean-energy problem can be fixed by both—as long as governments fund basic research and create incentives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and investors are patient while companies turn that research into marketable products. That’s why I’m working on it personally rather than through our foundation. In the past two years, there’s been a lot of progress. Twenty-three countries have committed to doubling their investments in clean-energy research by 2020. Breakthrough Energy Ventures, a private investment fund I am involved with, now has more than $1 billion from a variety of investors and will fund companies in several areas (such as grid-scale storage and geothermal power) that are ripe for innovation. BEV will also be working with a coalition of other clean-energy investors to connect them with governments. Right now, public and private spending on clean energy isn’t coordinated, which is one reason some promising technologies don’t make it to market. We want to bridge that gap. Melinda: Even breakthrough technology can’t stop the weather from changing. So the world needs to adapt to what’s happening now and what we know is coming. That’s why our foundation’s work, especially in global agriculture, is increasingly focused on climate issues. Hundreds of millions of people in developing countries depend on farming for their livelihoods. They had almost nothing to do with causing climate change, but they will suffer the most from it. When extreme weather ruins their harvest, they won’t have food to eat that year. They won’t have income to spend on basic necessities like health care and school fees. For smallholder farmers, climate change is not just an ominous global trend. It is a daily emergency. Green Super Rice and Scuba Rice, which this farmer has planted, have been bred to withstand extreme weather. But just as innovation can limit climate change, it can also help people cope with it. We invest to help farmers be more productive, so that they’ll have more buffer to withstand lean years when they come. We also invest in climate-smart crops that are less susceptible to extreme heat and cold, drought and flooding, and diseases and pests. For example, we’re working with partners including the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Science to develop varieties of rice that tolerate drought and require less fertilizer, herbicide, and pesticide. Innovations like this “Green Super Rice” could be key to fighting poverty and feeding the world in the decades to come.  4. Are you imposing your values on other cultures? Bill: On one level, I think the answer is obviously no. The idea that children shouldn’t die of malaria or be malnourished is not just our value. It’s a human value. Parents in every culture want their children to survive and thrive. Sometimes, though, the person asking this question is raising a deeper issue. It’s not so much a question about what we do, but how we do it. Do we really understand people’s needs? Are we working with people on the ground? Melinda: We’re acutely aware that some development programs in the past were led by people who assumed they knew better than the people they were trying to help. We’ve learned over the years that listening and understanding people’s needs from their perspective is not only more respectful—it’s also more effective. Our foundation is designed with this principle in mind. When we say “we” work on a certain issue, we don’t mean that Bill or I or the foundation’s employees are installing sewage systems in rapidly growing cities, delivering treatments for river blindness, or training farmers to rotate their crops. What we mean is that we fund organizations with years and sometimes decades of local experience that do those things. These organizations, our thousands of partners, keep us connected to the people we’re trying to help. We have about 1,500 employees in offices on four continents who look at the data, survey the universe of possible approaches, study what’s worked and what hasn’t, and develop strategies that we believe will maximize our impact. But one of the most important parts of their job is to listen to partners, adjust the strategies based on what they hear, and give implementers the leeway to use their expertise and their local knowledge. That’s not to say we always get it right. We don’t. But we try to approach our work with humility about what we don’t know and the determination to learn from our mistakes. On top of relying on local partners, we also have a strong conviction about the importance of empowerment. We aren’t interested in making choices for anyone. We invest in family planning, for example, not because we have a vision of what other people’s families should look like but because parents around the world have told us they want the tools to make their vision of their own family come to fruition. In all our work, we are interested in making sure people have the knowledge and power to make the best choices for themselves.  5. Does saving kids’ lives lead to overpopulation? Melinda: We asked ourselves the same question at first. Hans Rosling, the brilliant and inspiring public health advocate who died last year, was great at answering it. I wrote about the issue at length in our 2014 letter. But it bears repeating, because it is so counterintuitive. When more children live past the age of 5, and when mothers can decide if and when to have children, population sizes don’t go up. They go down. Parents have fewer children when they’re confident those children will survive into adulthood. Big families are in some ways an insurance policy against the tragic likelihood of losing a son or a daughter. We see this pattern throughout history. All over the world, when death rates among children go down, so do birth rates. It happened in France in the late 1700s. It happened in Germany in the late 1800s. Argentina in the 1910s, Brazil in the 1960s, Bangladesh in the 1980s. Bill: There’s another benefit to the pattern Melinda describes—first more children survive, then families decide to have fewer children—which is that it can lead to a burst of economic growth that economists call “the demographic dividend.” Here’s how it works. When more children live, you get one generation that’s relatively big. Then, when families decide to have fewer children, the next generation is much smaller. Eventually, a country ends up with relatively more people in the labor force producing economically—and relatively fewer dependents (very old or very young people). That’s a recipe for rapid economic development, especially if countries take advantage of it by investing in health and education. Fortunately, the number of child deaths is likely to keep going down. The rate of innovation in child health is extraordinary, and the world is starting to make progress on some of the most stubborn challenges in the field. For example, we now know that malnutrition is a contributing factor in half of all child deaths, but there are still many open questions about what causes malnutrition and how to prevent it. One promising area is the study of the microbiome—all the bacteria in the human gut—and the role it plays in kids’ ability to absorb nutrients. We’re also working with a partner on a device that’s the thickness of a piece of string that can go down infants’ noses and take 360-degree microscopic pictures of the gut. Soon, we’ll be able to see how a child is developing, instead of having to guess. Melinda: Saving the lives of children is its own justification. It also has the potential to improve life for everyone. But this demographic transition can happen in a reasonable period of time only if all women have access to contraceptives. Right now, more than 200 million don’t. For the sake of those women, their children, and their communities, we must meet their needs—and we must do it now. If we deny access, we are dooming them to a lifetime of poverty. But if we invest in providing access, families will use it to lift themselves out of poverty and build a better future for their children.  6. How are President Trump’s policies affecting your foundation’s work? Bill: In the past year, I’ve been asked about President Trump and his policies more often than all the other topics in this letter combined. The administration’s policies affect our foundation’s work in a number of areas. The most concrete example is foreign aid. For decades the United States has been a leader in the fight against disease and poverty abroad. These efforts save lives. They also create U.S. jobs. And they make Americans more secure by making poor countries more stable and stopping disease outbreaks before they become pandemics. The world is not a safer place when more people are sick or hungry. President Trump proposed severe cuts to foreign aid. To its credit, Congress has moved to put the money back in the budget. It’s better for the United States when it leads, through both hard power and soft power. More broadly, the America First worldview concerns me. It’s not that the United States shouldn’t look out for its people. The question is how best to do that. My view is that engaging with the world has proven over time to benefit everyone, including Americans, more than withdrawing does. Even if we measured everything the government did only by how much it helped American citizens, global engagement would still be a smart investment. We have met with President Trump and his team, just as we have met with people in previous administrations. With every administration—Republican and Democrat—we agree on some things and disagree on others. Although we disagree with this administration more than the others we’ve met with, we believe it's still important to work together whenever possible. We keep talking to them because if the U.S. cuts back on its investments abroad, people in other countries will die, and Americans will be worse off. Melinda: We need to work with the administration to garner as much support as we can for policies that will benefit the most impoverished people in the world. In our U.S. work, one premise we start with is that a college degree or career certificate is critical to a successful future. In short, a college education should be a pathway to prosperity for all Americans. The Trump administration’s leadership, along with Congress’s, will have a lot to do with whether it is. Specifically, student aid programs need to work better for low-income students. Right now, 2 million students who are eligible for aid don’t even apply for it, because the process is so burdensome. Some go into debt. Even worse, many don’t go to college at all. The government must continue to be generous in funding aid programs while following through on simplifying the application process. The futures of millions of young Americans are on the line. I would also say that I believe one of the duties of the president of the United States is to role model American values in the world. I wish our president would treat people, and especially women, with more respect when he speaks and tweets. Equality is an important national principle. The sanctity of each individual, regardless of race, religion, sexual orientation, or gender, is part of our country’s spirit. The president has a responsibility to set a good example and empower all Americans through his statements and his policies.  7. Why do you work with corporations? Melinda: We work with companies like GSK and Johnson & Johnson because they can do things no one else can. Take the example of developing new diagnostics, drugs, and vaccines for diseases of poverty. The basic science that underlies product development happens at research centers and universities. But when the goal is to build upon basic science, translate it into products that save lives, get those products tested and approved, and then manufacture those products, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies have the vast majority of the necessary expertise. Every partner we work with is required to make products developed with foundation funding widely available at an affordable price. Ideally, we’d like companies to seek out more opportunities to meet the needs of people in developing countries. If our limited partnerships encourage them to see potential in new markets, we’d consider it a big success. Bill: We think poor people should benefit from the same kind of innovation in health and agriculture that has improved life in the richest parts of the world. Much of that innovation comes out of the private sector. But companies have to make a return on their investments, which means they have little incentive to work on problems that mainly affect the world’s poorest people. We’re trying to change that—to encourage companies to focus a bit of their expertise on the problems of the poor without asking them to lose money along the way. The best examples so far are in global health. Some diseases of the poor require new vaccines and drugs, which as Melinda says is an area where biotech companies excel. So, for instance, we’re funding two early-stage companies that are working on ways to use messenger RNA to teach your body how to produce its own vaccines. It could lead to breakthroughs in HIV and malaria—as well as flu and even cancer. We’re also working with the private sector to make existing drugs and vaccines available to people in poor countries. There is a group of more than a dozen awful diseases, known collectively as neglected tropical diseases, that affect more than 1.5 billion people. Most of these diseases can be treated, but the drugs are too expensive for the poorest countries to buy and deliver to their people. Several years ago, we learned that a few pharmaceutical companies were donating the necessary drugs. We loved the idea and helped bring together a larger group of companies to donate even more. In 2016 they provided treatment for at least one of these diseases to 1 billion people in 130 countries. I’m optimistic that we can eliminate a number of neglected tropical diseases in the next decade, and this work is one reason why. Sometimes we use more complex financial deals to bring in the private sector. For example, donors can remove some of the risk for companies by guaranteeing them that they will either get a certain price for their product or sell a certain volume of it. We are one of several donors that created a price guarantee to scale up the delivery of a vaccine for pneumococcal disease, an infection that kills nearly half a million children every year. Poor children in 57 countries now get this vaccine, and it could save 1.5 million lives by 2020. We’re also working with the private sector in other areas, but those efforts aren’t as far along. Agriculture companies like Monsanto are making seeds that could help farmers in poor countries grow more food, earn more money, and (as Melinda mentioned earlier) adapt to climate change. And we’re working with mobile-phone providers like Vodafone so that more poor people can save money, make payments, and borrow through their phone. This work took off initially in Kenya and is now expanding to other countries, including India.  8. Is it fair that you have so much influence? Melinda: No. It’s not fair that we have so much wealth when billions of others have so little. And it’s not fair that our wealth opens doors that are closed to most people. World leaders tend to take our phone calls and seriously consider what we have to say. Cash-strapped school districts are more likely to divert money and talent toward ideas they think we will fund. But there is nothing secret about our objectives as a foundation. We are committed to being open about what we fund and what the results have been. (It’s not always immediately clear what’s been successful and what hasn’t, but we work hard to assess our impact, course correct, and share lessons.) We do this work, and use whatever influence we have, to help as many people as possible and to advance equity around the world. Although we’ve had some success, I think it would be hard to argue at this point that we made the world focus too much on health, education, or poverty. Bill: As much as we try to encourage feedback, we know that some of our critics don’t speak up because they don’t want to risk losing money. That means we need to hire well, consult experts, learn constantly, and seek out different viewpoints. Even though our foundation is the biggest in the world, the money we have is very small compared to what businesses and governments spend. For example, California spends more than our entire endowment just to run its public school system for one year. So we use our resources in a very specific way: to test out promising innovations, collect and analyze the data, and let businesses and governments scale up and sustain what works. We’re like an incubator in that way. We aim to improve the quality of the ideas that go into public policies and to steer funding toward those ideas that have the most impact. There’s another issue at the heart of this question. If we think it’s unfair that we have so much wealth, why don’t we give it all to the government? The answer is that we think there’s always going to be a unique role for foundations. They’re able to take a global view to find the greatest needs, take a long-term approach to solving problems, and manage high-risk projects that governments can’t take on and corporations won’t. If a government tries an idea that fails, someone wasn’t doing their job. Whereas if we don’t try some ideas that fail, we’re not doing our jobs.  9. What happens when the two of you disagree? Melinda: We never disagree. Just kidding. Bill almost never gets this question. I get it all the time. Sometimes, it’s from journalists hinting that Bill must be the one making the decisions. Other times, it’s from women philanthropists asking advice about how to work more effectively with their husbands. Bill and I have two things going in our favor. First, we agree on basic values. For our wedding, Bill’s parents gave us a sculpture of two birds side by side, staring at the horizon, and it’s still in front of our house. I think of it all the time, because fundamentally we’re looking in the same direction. Second, Bill is very open-minded, which isn’t necessarily how people perceive him. I love Bill because he has a kind heart, listens to other people, and lets himself be moved by what they say. When I tell a story about what I’ve seen, he feels it. He might ask me to gather some data for good measure, but he doesn’t doubt the reality of my experiences or the soundness of my judgment. Sharing a laugh with the Zhou Mingting family in Hainan, China. When Bill first came over to the foundation from Microsoft, he was used to being in charge. I’d stayed home with our kids, so I was restarting my career. There were times I felt that disparity—in meetings when I was reticent and he was voluble, or when the person we were meeting with looked toward Bill and not me. It’s always been important to us that we are equal partners in our foundation’s work. We’ve learned over time to give each other feedback at home about times in the office when we didn’t meet that goal. Gradually, I’ve focused more and more on gender issues, because I’ve seen repeatedly that the more empowered women and girls are, the stronger their communities are. As I’ve thought more deeply about equality for women around the world, I’ve been proud that Bill and I have achieved it in our life together. This is a balance that married couples, and co-workers, all over the world are always trying to strike. One of the reasons this work has been so fun for me is that we’ve been on this journey together. Bill: I agree with all of this! Though I have to admit that Melinda is more comfortable with—and better at—talking in public about personal subjects than I am. As she says, our common values serve us well. We agree on the big issues. Our occasional disagreements these days are over tactics. Because I've been a public figure longer, and because I’m a man, some people assume I am making the big decisions. That's never been the case. Some people see Melinda as the heart of our foundation, the emotional core. But just as she knows I’m more emotional than people realize, I know she’s more analytical than people realize. When I get really enthusiastic about something, I count on her to make sure I’m being realistic. I also love watching her bring together just the right mix of people to solve a problem. She helps me understand when I can push our teams harder (as I pretty much always did at Microsoft) and when I need to ease off. We are partners in both senses that people use the word these days: at home and at work.",10 tough questions we get asked,true

A judge on Friday threw out a lawsuit claiming that the Fairfax County Office of Elections had improperly accepted absentee ballot applications.  The suit, filed last week by the Virginia Institute for Public Policy, said that the office was approving mailed absentee-ballot applications of voters who hadn’t provided the last four digits of their Social Security number, as required by law. It included an affidavit by a woman who said she had seen that more than 300 such applications had been approved.  In its written response, the elections office pointed to Virginia law that says such a suit can only be brought by an “aggrieved voter,” a candidate or a candidate’s campaign or party. The Virginia Institute for Public Policy, being a nonprofit corporation, isn’t any of those, and on Friday, Judge Michael Devine agreed that they didn’t have standing to sue.  While the institute said it’s dedicated to fair elections, Devine said that didn’t put them into the category of a party with a direct interest: “Everybody who votes shares that interest.”  The defendants don’t claim all of the applications were completely filled out. In a joint stipulation entered in court Friday, both sides agreed Fairfax County General Registrar Scott Konopasek “has accepted and approved some applications for absentee and ‘vote by mail’ ballots that were submitted by mail (or other remote means) that did not include the last four digits of the applicants’ Social Security numbers.

Four days later, his office abruptly announced he had changed his mind.  “Family obligations” was all his office would say, refusing to publicly elaborate in a decision that, times being what they are, unleashed a barrage of conspiracy theories. Was the governor having a bad reaction to the Covid-19 booster shot he had just gotten? Were any of his children — he has four ages 12 and under — infected again with the coronavirus? No and no, Capitol sources said.  Allies of the governor noted that most parents would understand why a couple with four small children might not want to take an extended trip to Glasgow over Halloween. California environmentalists also suggested that he might not be so wrong to skip the annual climate conference, which many of them view as a jet-fuel-wasting spectacle.  In theory, California conservatives should also have welcomed the decision. When it appeared the governor might be summit-bound, Kevin Kiley, a Republican assemblyman who challenged the governor in the September recall election, wrote in a blog post that “in the absence of our jet-setting governor,” he was requesting a special session on the port crisis, holding oversight hearings on pandemic unemployment fraud, holding town hall events on the governor’s vaccine mandate for schoolchildren and calling for hearings on mask mandates in elementary school classrooms.",Where’s Gov.

On Wednesday, it reported just 310 nationwide.  About 70 percent of the eligible population has been fully vaccinated, the government announced Wednesday, and life in the country has returned to a state of cautious optimism and near normalcy from one of acute concern. Tokyo has lifted nearly all restrictions on daily life, and the subways, streets and shopping arcades are once again filled with people. The city has reported fewer than 50 daily cases for over a week.  Experts in Japan are unclear about what caused the precipitous drop in cases, although they agree that high vaccination levels and ubiquitous masking are probably the most important factors keeping the virus at bay.  In remarks to reporters on Wednesday, government experts said other factors, such as cooler weather, an effective testing regime and heightened caution during the recent surge in cases, may have also contributed to the sudden drop in cases.",Daily coronavirus cases in Japan fall to the hundreds after a summer peak.,true

Employees of the network shared emails and the editing history in the site’s publishing software that revealed who requested dozens of articles and how.  Mr. Timpone did not respond to repeated attempts to contact him by email and phone, or through a note left at his home in the Chicago suburbs. Many of his executives did not respond to or declined requests for comment.  The network is one of a proliferation of partisan local-news sites funded by political groups associated with both parties. Liberal donors have poured millions of dollars into operations like Courier, a network of eight sites that began covering local news in swing states last year. Conservative activists are running similar sites, like the Star News group in Tennessee, Virginia and Minnesota.  But those operations run just several sites each, while Mr. Timpone’s network has more than twice as many sites as the nation’s largest newspaper chain, Gannett. And while political groups have helped finance networks like Courier, investors in news operations typically don’t weigh in on specific articles.  While Mr. Timpone’s sites generally do not post information that is outright false, the operation is rooted in deception, eschewing hallmarks of news reporting like fairness and transparency. Only a few dozen of the sites disclose funding from advocacy groups. Traditional news organizations do not accept payment for articles; the Federal Trade Commission requires that advertising that looks like articles be clearly labeled as ads.  Most of the sites declare in their “About” pages that they to aim “to provide objective, data-driven information without political bias.” But in April, an editor for the network reminded freelancers that “clients want a politically conservative focus on their stories, so avoid writing stories that only focus on a Democrat lawmaker, bill, etc.,” according to an email viewed by The Times.","As Local News Dies, a Pay-for-Play Network Rises in Its Place",true
275,241539950659389993784110406277708524347,"You might have missed it amid all the sound and fury of impeachment, but it’s been a busy week for disinformation. Twitter, the Wall Street Journal reports, will start removing posts that it determines are “misleading about an election.” Elizabeth Warren’s campaign rolled out a plan on “Fighting Digital Disinformation,” including a pledge not to “knowingly use or spread false or manipulated information.” And the House Ethics Committee announced that members of the House of Representatives who share deepfakes on social media might face sanctions from the House itself. The ethics announcement attracted the least attention of all, but it’s actually an important step in creating standards for how elected representatives should use social media.  This news might seem trivial compared to the drama of the impeachment trial going on just down the street. But as technology companies and governments alike grapple with how to address the spread of online falsehoods, the committee’s memo is noteworthy. Four years after the shock to the system of 2016, everyone agrees that disinformation and misinformation are problems that need to be dealt with, but the question remains who is best positioned to accept responsibility. The House of Representatives appears to be, in some small way, beginning to take on the task.  The committee’s “pink sheet”—an advisory memorandum on House rules—alerts members of the House to the dangers of posting deepfakes on social media, warning that “manipulation of images and videos that are intended to mislead the public can harm … discourse and reflect discreditably on the House.” For this reason, disseminating “deep fakes or other audio-visual distortions intended to mislead the public” could violate the House’s Code of Official Conduct, which governs the behavior of the chamber’s members and employees.  This might sound like the committee is addressing a problem that doesn’t exist yet. As far as we know, there have not been any cases in which a member of Congress—or any other prominent American political figure—has tweeted a genuine deepfake, meaning doctored audio or video generated through machine learning than can produce extremely lifelike and misleading results. After all, deepfakes—though concerning—just aren’t all that common in politics (yet).  Politicians have, however, published plenty of what the memorandum describes as “other audio-visual distortions”—that is, photos or video deceptively manipulated in a less sophisticated manner than a deepfake. Sometimes the manipulation is obvious: President Trump recently tweeted a picture altered to depict him putting a Medal of Honor around the neck of a dog that played a role in the raid on Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (the original photo showed the president bestowing the medal to a Vietnam War medic). But U.S. political figures have published more deceptive images, too. Three days after the strike that killed Iranian general Qassem Soleimani, Rep. Paul Gosar tweeted a photo appearing to show President Obama shaking hands with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani; it took 40 minutes before he acknowledged that the picture was actually a fake, a doctored version of a shot from a 2011 meeting between Obama and then-Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.  The world is a better place without these guys in power. pic.twitter.com/gDoXQu9vO5 — Paul Gosar (@DrPaulGosar) January 6, 2020  It’s easy to see why the committee might be particularly concerned about these manipulations now. Quoting a Congressional Research Service article on deepfakes, the memo warns that when members of the House or their staff tweet or share deepfakes or other manipulated audio or video, they could “erode public trust, negatively affect public discourse, or even sway an election.” Consider, for example, the misleadingly edited video tweeted out by President Trump in May 2019 that appeared to display Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi slurring her words at a news conference—or the wide circulation of a deceptive clip that seemed to show Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden make a racist remark. Now imagine such a clip, with sophisticated editing or not, circulated in the days or even hours before an election—and given the appearance of legitimacy by retweets from members of Congress and perhaps even the president himself.  The memo changes the calculation for members: Tweet misleading content, and you could be subject to House disciplinary rules. The Ethics Committee asks members and staff to think before they tweet: Before posting on social media, “[m]embers and staff are expected to take reasonable efforts to consider whether such representations are deep fakes or are intentionally distorted to mislead the public.” Members who break this guidance could be subject to public admonition by the committee of the offending members. Technically, the full House could even censure members—or expel them for violation of House rules.  Censure is unlikely, though, and expulsion even less so. Only five members have ever met the latter fate, three of whom were expelled for fighting for the Confederacy. Tweeting a deepfake may be harmful to democracy, but it might not be quite the same as taking up arms against the republic.  More realistically, the committee may hope that the guideline itself will have a deterrent effect. The committee is often reluctant to discipline members, so the most realistic deterrent may come from members’ desire to avoid scrutiny from the Office of Congressional Ethics, which investigates and produces public reports about ethics violations. As former senior counsel to the House Michael L. Stern, told us, “[T]he primary motivation for complying with this edict is not the formal sanction, but the embarrassment of getting called out for violations, as well as the desire to avoid an investigation” by either the committee or the independent Office of Congressional Ethics.  In this way, the pink sheet is a norm-setting exercise for the House—and a bipartisan one, as the committee is the only one in the House evenly split between Democrats and Republicans. When members tweet doctored pictures or share altered videos, they now do so as knowing violators of the House’s position on this type of content.  So the guidelines set out in the memo might not have that much bite. Yet they still represent a shift from the current state of things—which is to say, an ad hoc system in which tech platforms are effectively building the content moderation plane in midair, setting out broad rules and then struggling to decide the extent to which politicians get special treatment. The result of these efforts has been that, by and large, citizens and users of the major platforms have come to think of the platforms themselves as the governing bodies to whom appeals should be addressed when a prominent political figure publishes misleading or objectionable content. Every time President Trump posts a threat on Twitter, for example, hundreds of other users will tweet at Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and other executives demanding to know why the platform won’t remove content that appears to violate its terms of service.  Hey @Twitter, is threatening nuclear war not a violation of terms of service? https://t.co/Gwz2EZHKnu — Kal Penn (@kalpenn) August 11, 2017  The situation has become so commonplace that it may no longer seem strange. But there is something bizarre about the notion that private platforms not only can regulate what and how politicians communicate with their constituents and the rest of the world, but that those platforms should. As any number of scholars and journalists have pointed out, the responsibility of deciding what speech is and is not within the bounds of acceptable discourse is, on its face, a task better suited to democratic governance than private enterprise. The Ethics Committee guidance is a small step toward governmental institutions accepting at least some of that burden.  That said, the House shouldering part of that weight means that the chamber will now have to grapple with some of the puzzling content moderation questions that only platforms have dealt with until now. Just as Twitter or Facebook users whose content is removed will appeal to the platforms to argue that their posts don’t violate the terms of service, surely the Ethics Committee and the Office of Congressional Ethics are going to be faced with the problem of assessing whether a member or staffer has actually violated the rule. Recall that the memo’s prohibition includes an intent requirement—so a member who shares a deepfake could argue that he or she too was duped, or explain that the shared deepfake was not a deception, but merely a joke. In fact, after he published the fake image of Obama shaking hands with Rouhani, that’s exactly what Gosar did: “[N]o one said this wasn’t photoshopped. No one said the president of Iran was dead. No one said Obama met with Rouhani in person,” Gosar wrote.  Then there are the new questions that emerge from two sets of overlapping rules between the House and the platforms, which will create headaches for both parties. Platforms are likely to face two situations: those in which a member spreads misleading content that appears to violate the terms of the memo and the House does nothing, and those in which the House issues some sort of sanction.  In the first case, where a member spreads misleading content but the committee takes no action, there will no doubt still be calls—as there are every time something similar happens—for platforms to do something. These calls are natural: Platforms have the greatest capacity to stop the spread of content on their services by using their content moderation infrastructure, and so it feels like they should exercise it. But, as noted above, it is jarring to ask a private company, with no democratic mandate or legitimacy, to take action against the speech of a public representative when the House Committee on Ethics itself has not done so. This situation appears to be a lose-lose for platforms: Take no action and they will continue to face charges of negligence in their roles at gatekeepers; do something and they will appear to be usurping the role of the committee to police the boundaries of acceptable conduct by elected representatives.  The second case isn’t easy either. Where a particular post has resulted in sanction from the committee, what should platforms do to best facilitate democratic accountability? Continuing to allow false content to spread might allow it to continue to do harm. But removing a post by a representative could prevent constituents from holding their member of Congress accountable, because fewer people will be aware of the post in the first place.  This situation calls for thinking outside the binary of taking down content or leaving it up, which platforms are starting to show in other cases—like flagging content that has been rated false by fact-checkers, or Twitter’s (as yet unused) policy of placing warning screens on content that breaks its rules but is in the public interest. When it comes to deepfakes and other “synthetic and manipulated media,” for example, Twitter has proposed placing a notice next to such posts or adding some other kind of warning, which could mesh well with whatever action the committee takes. Similarly, platforms could reduce circulation of misleading content that is the subject of committee censure and add context noting the committee’s action.  And, as ever, there’s the little matter of what to do about the president. The Ethics Committee can pass whatever rules it likes for members, but that’s not going to stop Trump from tweeting and retweeting. What happens if, for example, members of the House retweet a Trump tweet containing a misleadingly edited video? The members might be censured while the president would remain untouched.  Then again, perhaps this mirrors the struggles of Twitter itself: Puzzled by how to handle presidential tweets, the platform has written into its terms of service an exception for “newsworthiness,” which essentially allows Trump to publish whatever he likes. (Other platforms have similar rules.) Of course, the House has no power over Trump’s Twitter feed, and while the platform could limit his tweets if it wanted, it has decided not to.  The Ethics Committee is now going to get a taste of the absurdities and contradictions of regulating social media. We’ll have to wait and see whether Twitter users start tweeting at the committee as well as @jack and asking that congressional tweets be taken down—or demanding to know why members have been unjustly punished.",Members of the House Are on Notice: No Tweeting Deepfakes,true

Fauci, the director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, shot down the discussion that has been raging among politicians and pundits, calling it “a circular argument” in a conversation Monday with National Geographic.  “If you look at the evolution of the virus in bats and what's out there now, [the scientific evidence] is very, very strongly leaning toward this could not have been artificially or deliberately manipulated … Everything about the stepwise evolution over time strongly indicates that [this virus] evolved in nature and then jumped species,” Fauci says. Based on the scientific evidence, he also doesn’t entertain an alternate theory—that someone found the coronavirus in the wild, brought it to a lab, and then it accidentally escaped.  Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.  Fauci is most concerned that the United States will be put to the test this fall and winter by a second wave of COVID-19 if the country does not blunt the infection rate by the summer.  “Shame on us if we don't have enough tests by the time this so-called return might occur in the fall and winter,” he says, advising that the U.S. needs to make sure we not only have an adequate supply of tests available before a second wave hits, but also a system for getting those tests to the people who most need them.  “I don't think there's a chance that this virus is just going to disappear,” he says. “It's going to be around, and if given the opportunity, it will resurge.” As such, Fauci says the U.S. should also focus this summer on properly reinforcing the nation’s health care system, ensuring the availability of hospital beds, ventilators, and personal protective equipment for health care workers.  He also stressed the importance of continuing to social distance everywhere until the case counts start to fall in cities and states. The U.S. witnessed about 20,000 to 30,000 new cases every day in the month of April, suggesting the country is stuck in its peak.  Still, he remains optimistic that a vaccine will be ready within an historically short time frame, citing one promising candidate that he thinks may move into advanced clinical trials by the early summer. Fauci has said that he thinks a final vaccine could be available for general use as early as January, which would break records for the speed at which previous vaccines were developed.  5:03  One reason for his confidence is the “impressive” results being seen now in animals tested with a vaccine candidate made by Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Moderna Therapeutics, which brought it into human trials in a record 42 days. The candidate is what is known as an mRNA vaccine—a drug that uses snippets of a virus’s genetic material—rather than the dead or weakened virus itself—to build the proteins that trigger the body’s protective immune response.  To date, no type of mRNA vaccine has been licensed for use in humans, but Fauci believes there is great promise for this technology targeting the coronavirus, based in part on his experience developing treatments for HIV/AIDS in the 1980s and ‘90s.  “For some reason that we're still struggling with, the body does not make an adequate immune response to HIV,” he says. To fight off that virus, a vaccine has to work better than the body’s own natural response. By contrast, “it's obvious that many people make a very adequate immune response” to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and the animal trials so far show that modest doses of the mRNA vaccine for coronavirus have also generated a strong immune response.  He adds that NIAID is still developing and supporting multiple vaccine efforts, in case those that go into trials soonest don’t ultimately prove safe and effective. “You want a lot of shots on goal. We want four or five candidates that we put out there all within a reasonable time,” he says.  Fauci told National Geographic he’s concerned about states rushing to reopen before their infection rates fall. He also shared how he manages the barrage of new scientific information being released about COVID-19, and how his family and faith keep him going despite his increasingly hectic schedule.  (The following interview has been edited for length and clarity.)  Fauci on the vaccine  You’ve been the NIAID director since 1984, witnessing dozens of disease outbreaks. One of the first was the HIV/AIDS epidemic. How does that experience compare with COVID-19?  One of the important advantages is what we call targeted drug development. Viruses cause disease by binding to receptors on cells in your body, be they in your upper airway or in your lung, in the case of COVID-19. They then replicate at a rapid rate that triggers a variety of pathogenic processes. Targeting drugs to interfere at one or more vulnerable sites within this replication cycle is something that we learned with HIV.  Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.

The Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian award, recognizes exceptional meritorious service. Photograph by Karen Bleier, AFP via Getty Images  SARS-CoV-2 [the virus that causes COVID-19] has the same sort of vulnerable points. We need to identify them and develop drugs, either alone or in combination, to block the replication.  Are there also lessons from HIV/AIDS that relate to developing a COVID-19 vaccine?  Vaccines are a bit different. We have a better chance of quickly getting, relatively speaking, a vaccine for the novel coronavirus than we did for HIV, because for some reason that’s still unknown the body does not make an adequate immune response to HIV.  We don't necessarily have that challenge with this coronavirus because it's obvious that many people make a very adequate immune response. They clear the virus, and they do well. As we know from the natural history of this disease, the majority of people actually either get well without any symptoms—they're called asymptomatic—or they have minimal symptoms, where they get a fever, some aches, and then they recover.  The fact that the majority of people can actually clear the virus is a very good sign for the feasibility of developing a vaccine.  The two most widely discussed vaccine candidates are an mRNA vaccine from Moderna, which reached human trials in a record 42 days, and Oxford University’s candidate, based on what’s known as a nonreplicating viral vector. Yet no vaccine based on these two technologies has ever been licensed for human use. What makes these two vaccines seem so promising, especially on this expedited timeline?  These vaccines are inducing, at least in animal models, really rather substantial immune responses, particularly the mRNA vaccine. When we look at the immune response that you can induce with a modest dose—one that's feasible to be translated into humans—and the amount of time it takes to get to that level of immunity, it is really quite impressive. It is also really easy to scale up with these two, in the sense of making a lot of doses pretty quickly. So you're right, they have not been approved, as many of the other vaccine platforms have, but the promise is great.  We at NIAID are either developing or supporting the development of multiple candidates. You want a lot of shots on goal. We want four or five candidates that we put out there all within a reasonable time—maybe June, July, or August—to get them into an advanced trial. The mRNA one is already well into phase one of clinical trials, and we're getting ready to go into phase two and three sometime in the early summer.  Fauci on reopening and masks  As states move to reopen businesses and warmer weather lures people outside, how concerned are you about a fresh spike in infections in the U.S.?  Take a look at the guidelines for Opening Up America Again. There are very well delineated checkpoints. There's a gateway where infections must go down for 14 days before you can enter into phase one for reopening. If you fulfill the requirements of phase one, you move to phase two. If you do it there, you go to phase three.  So when you see somebody in an environment in which the infections are not going down, and then you see 30 to 40 people on a beach with no mask … well that's very nice to have fun in the sun, but you're really putting yourself and everyone at risk for creating an even bigger spike in infections.  Do you fear a second wave?  What’s impressed me the most—but clearly in a disturbing way—is the extraordinary efficiency of how the virus spreads. It spreads so much more efficiently than influenza does. You see situations where people at home try and physically separate; they have no contact except they've touched the plate or a doorknob, and they wind up getting infected.  The clusters in families, the outbreaks on the Teddy Roosevelt aircraft carrier, the enormous spread on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Yokohama harbor—it’s a very, very transmissible virus.  Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.  We're going to be put to the test as we move toward the fall and winter of this year. If we do it correctly, then we could be able to blunt and diminish the daily rate of infections in this country as we get into the summer. I can't guarantee it, but if we do things right, that likely will happen.  But I don't think there's a chance that this virus is just going to disappear. It's going to be around, and if given the opportunity, it will resurge. We now will have a few months—May June, July, August—to prepare, by making sure our health system is adequately supplied with ventilators, ICU beds, personal protective equipment, etcetera. We need to not only have tests, but to make sure the people who need tests can get tested.  So that by the time we get to September, we don't have the dialogue continually fixating on do you have enough tests? Shame on us if we don't have enough tests by the time this so-called return might occur in the fall and winter.  What’s your position on the general public wearing face masks?  I'm glad you asked, because it has evolved over the weeks and months. When there was first discussion, it was at a time when face masks—either surgical masks or N95 respirators—were at high scarcity.  Let's assume that we now have enough masks or that you could easily make a cloth covering, as was suggested appropriately by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. I think those are reasonable assumptions. We know that the masks are better in the health-care setting to prevent someone who's infected from coughing and sneezing and infecting people in the environment. When you look at what the mask does for the general population, the data are not 100 percent: It doesn't 100 percent protect you from infecting somebody else, and it certainly doesn't 100 percent prevent somebody else from infecting you.  But if you wear a mask, you are getting some protection for yourself, and if you happen to be infected and don't know it, you're to some extent preventing transmission to someone else. Given that, it just makes sense that first of all, the best way to prevent spread is to maintain the physical distance of six feet.  So, if you're in a situation where you're in contact with no one, then you don't have to be walking around with a mask all day, that's for sure. But if you are in a situation where you are going to be within the realm of six feet—the grocery store or even walking out on the street—then wear it.  Fauci on the information deluge and the “virus made in Chinese lab” claim.  How do you keep up with the barrage of information and filter down to the most important science?  It's like drinking from a fire hydrant. It really is. Fortunately for me, I have a staff of three to four really good people who sift through the papers and when something looks unreasonable or “pie in the sky,” they don't bother me with that. Then when all of these studies come across my desk, I read the title and the abstract. If it looks feasible, I'll put it aside and try and read it. When it's something that they think I should read, they make sure I read it.  Even with that screening process, it's still very difficult to consume everything that's out there, particularly with this relatively recent trend with these non-peer-reviewed, pre-publications [that have not gone through traditional vetting to appear in major journals].  So, what's your advice to the public at-large for sifting through the headlines and making sense of it all?  Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.  Anybody can claim to be an expert even when they have no idea what they're talking about—and it's very difficult for the general public to distinguish. So, make sure the study is coming from a reputable organization that generally gives you the truth—though even with some reputable organizations, you occasionally get an outlier who's out there talking nonsense. If something is published in places like New England Journal of Medicine, Science, Nature, Cell, or JAMA—you know, generally that is quite well peer reviewed because the editors and the editorial staff of those journals really take things very seriously.  One topic in the news lately has been the origins of SAR-CoV-2. Do you believe or is there evidence that the virus was made in the lab in China or accidentally released from a lab in China?  If you look at the evolution of the virus in bats, and what's out there now is very, very strongly leaning toward this [virus] could not have been artificially or deliberately manipulated—the way the mutations have naturally evolved. A number of very qualified evolutionary biologists have said that everything about the stepwise evolution over time strongly indicates that it evolved in nature and then jumped species.  Sure, but what if scientists found the virus outside the lab, brought it back, and then it escaped?  But that means it was in the wild to begin with. That's why I don't get what they're talking about [and] why I don't spend a lot of time going in on this circular argument.  Fauci’s life right now  What’s your typical day like?  I get up around five o'clock in the morning, and I usually wind up running downstairs, getting a quick breakfast, and looking at a thousand emails—literally a thousand.  I then head to the NIH [National Institutes of Health] for my day job—trying to develop a vaccine and drugs and running a $6 billion institution. I stay there until around one o'clock, and then I go down to the White House for multiple meetings. First, I meet with the doctor group—myself, coronavirus response coordinator Debbie Birx, director Bob Redfield from the CDC, commissioner Steve Hahn from FDA, and others. We then go into the task force meeting run by Vice President [Mike Pence], which usually lasts about an hour and a half. We summarize this pre-brief with the vice president and then go brief President [Donald Trump] for the press conference.  Then, the work starts … I head home or back to the NIH and work until the wee hours of the morning. The whole day is punctuated by everybody needing to talk to you: every governor in the states, every congressional leader, every leader in the White House. It's constant conference calls. It's an almost impossible situation—and that's seven days a week.  Then you superimpose upon that all the press you do—the TV or the radio or the interviews. It's kind of a surrealistic state. I have to wake up in the morning and literally, without being facetious, ask my wife, what day is it?  Wow, how do you unwind?  I power walk with my wife, usually at night or on the weekends. It's dark, but we still do it anyway.  Has it ever been too taxing?  A couple of months ago, I was foolish and just thought I could get away with almost no sleep. I mean, like three hours a night. I did that for a few weeks, and it almost killed me. It really wore me down badly. Thank goodness I have a very intelligent and clinically skilled wife who turned things around and said, You got to remember to eat, and you've got to remember to sleep. The day is still impossible, but I don't think I'm going to drop dead from it. I hope not.  You went to a Jesuit high school, where you learned the importance of doing good for the public. How has that experience informed your professional life?  My whole life was almost served to me on the basis that my mother and father were very much oriented toward service. They were never really interested in money or material things. That's just the way they were, both of them. So I never knew there was anything like going out there and making a lot of money, and that was really cemented when I went both to a Jesuit high school and a Jesuit college, where the entire theme was service for others.  I almost never had any other inkling of doing anything except something that would have a public service component to it. I'm very much of a people person, but I'm also scientifically inclined.

In an Oct. 28 cease and desist letter, Nessel told Big League Politics the videos violate Michigan law because they contain ""misleading and false election information,"" according to a photo of the letter posted to the conservative blog Gateway Pundit.  Nessel's spokesperson Ryan Jarvi confirmed Tuesday the attorney general sent a letter to the site and what Gateway Pundit posted appeared to be authentic. Nessel's office will release a statement about the cease and desist later this week, Jarvi said.  The videos no longer appear to be live on Big League Politics' website, though a combined version of the audio exists on the video-sharing platform Bitchute, which is known for hosting the far-right and conspiracy theorists.  Big League Politics is a right-wing news site started in 2017 by former Breitbart employees, according to The Atlantic. The HuffPost called the site a place “for people who find Breitbart too reasonable.” It has been known to promote false claims and conspiracy theories.  In the weeks leading up to the election, Big League Politics reporter Shane Trejo posted stories using audio recordings of what he said was a poll worker training in Detroit. The videos didn’t record images of the training; rather it showed subtitles of what was said as the audio played.

278,138675248850509860949526610093702868912,"For the past seven months, misinformation and false claims of fraud in Fulton County have dominated certain corners of the Internet and the Republican Party, with many refusing to accept results that showed three separate times that Donald Trump lost Georgia.  Georgia's most populous county is home to the heavily Democratic city of Atlanta — and a history of problems and shortcomings with election administration.  But ever since November's presidential race saw President Joe Biden flip Georgia by about 12,000 votes, some pro-Trump media outlets and politicians have zeroed in on Fulton in search of a smoking gun that would prove massive fraud cost the former president a victory. Those calls have come even after a full hand count risk-limiting audit (RLA) confirmed Biden's victory and a Trump campaign-ordered recount validated victory once more.  In recent weeks: A Newsmax personality launched a weekend of fantastical speculation about an alarm at a building that included Fulton's ballot warehouse; a Constitution Party officer who's espoused fringe views about 9/11, presidential assassinations and elections for years has advanced a lawsuit seeking to find ""counterfeit absentee ballots;"" and prominent lawmakers have suggested that evidence would emerge that could result in decertification of the election — all as election workers continue to face death threats for doing their jobs.  Ahead of a hearing on the lawsuit seeking to inspect images of Fulton's absentee ballots for fraud, a pair of pro-Trump media outlets have pushed false and misleading stories about the county's absentee drop box documentation and risk-limiting audit forms, implying or outright stating — but without real evidence — that the already-certified election should be overturned.    Fulton County drop box forms  One claim is that Fulton County is missing hundreds of transfer records for thousands of absentee ballots deposited in 38 drop boxes ahead of November's election, with an implication that the missing paperwork could or should invalidate more ballots than the margin of Biden's victory.  Earlier this week, a pro-Trump media outlet that has amplified calls for a so-called ""forensic audit"" of the election kicked off a firestorm of criticism, asserting the county was missing 385 absentee ballot transfer forms used to document how many ballots were retrieved from drop boxes daily and suggesting the provenance of nearly 19,000 ballots were questionable.  This comes from an ongoing open records request that the Georgia Star News made to Fulton for all transfer forms from the Nov. 3 election. The media outlet only received a portion of Fulton's forms.  According to Georgia Star News, an elections worker emailed the outlet stating that ""a few forms are missing"" and that ""some procedural paperwork may have been misplaced"" and the county disputed that 19,000 ballots were unaccounted for.  Then, the story published and rocketed across the pro-Trump mediasphere, prompting Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (who faces his own pro-Trump primary challenge from election denier Rep. Jody Hice) to announce an investigation in the county's actions and further fanning the flames.  But after GPB News asked the county Monday about the forms not included in the Georgia Star's records request, elections staff located all but eight of the more than 1,500 forms, sent them to state investigators and provided them to GPB News on a flash drive.  According to an analysis of the scanned transfer forms and a spreadsheet from Fulton elections, nearly 79,000 ballots were deposited in the county's 38 drop boxes — or more than half of mail-in ballots cast in the election.  Jessica Corbitt, a Fulton spokeswoman, said that the county followed proper procedures in collecting the drop box ballots and the county was continuing to research the few remaining. Fulton elections director Rick Barron said in an elections board meeting Thursday that staff spent more than 200 hours this week locating the forms, to counter the claims of ""missing"" forms.  Absentee drop boxes were authorized by an emergency State Election Board rule last year, which included the requirement of 24/7 video surveillance of the boxes as well as the transfer forms filled out by a two-person collection team. While the forms are required by rule, they are not part of the verification process to determine if an absentee ballot is legally cast and counted.  Some of the transfer forms show ballots returned without envelopes, making them ineligible to be counted. Others were from different counties or even different states — also not counted.  If Fulton County is unable to find the handful of transfer forms, they could be sent to the State Election Board for investigation, just as in Coffee, Grady and Taylor counties — and the forms have no effect on the authenticity of ballots or count of the election. Every ballot that is returned is tied to a voter, matched with an application for a ballot, and authenticated by poll workers before counting.  GPB News has obtained records for all 123 counties that used drop boxes, countering claims among some pro-Trump media outlets that there are more than 300,000 ballots' worth of forms ""missing"" statewide.  Grady County's registrar sent an email to the state saying there are no forms because ""I am the only one in my office, and I was the only one who emptied the drop box every day."" Taylor County's registrar said she did not keep track and asked ""How am I going to be able to do these forms?""  Those investigations are ongoing.  Fulton County risk-limiting audit  Thursday morning, a report by Just The News used selectively edited notes from a state-appointed monitor and a misunderstanding of elections and the risk-limiting audit process to claim that ballots ""may be missing.""  The article notes that in the tally sheet documents uploaded on the state's website, Fulton has several data entry errors — appearing to duplicate batches, missing some batch numbers and failing to check boxes about unsealing the container before counting.  But there are more human explanations to the paperwork — as well as a reminder that the results of that audit were not certified and did not affect the initial or final counts of the election.  After the first results of the election, Georgia's 159 counties conducted a full hand-count risk-limiting audit: a post-election audit that is designed to determine if the correct winner won, not verify the precise margin. Typically, an RLA would use a smaller, statistically significant random sampling of ballots that are hand counted and compared to the results. But because the margin in the presidential contest was narrow and attention was so high, the state ordered all the ballots to be hand counted.  During the RLA process, some counties discovered ballots that were not included in the original tally, but the results of the RLA did not change the results of the election. Any mistakes were incorporated into a machine recount requested by the Trump campaign after the RLA.  As for the missing batch numbers and duplicate batches, Georgia's RLA used a software called Arlo from a company called VotingWorks, who helped the state conduct the audit. Once the audit teams counted their batches and filled out the tally sheets, the batches were entered into the system. Fulton officials said it was not easy to see previous batches entered to ensure there was not duplication.  There are 1,927 tally sheets on the Fulton documents section of the state's RLA results, and 1,916 rows of batches on the state's Excel spreadsheet. Additionally, Fulton's election results saw Joe Biden get 381,144 votes and Donald Trump get 137,240 votes. The RLA tallies show 381,179 votes for Biden and 137,620 votes for Trump, confirming Biden won and coming within 0.1% of the ballots cast the first time.  As for the notes from Seven Hills Strategies that suggest fraudulent activity, according to copies of the reports obtained by GPB News, the monitor found plenty of parts of the process that need improvement, but no evidence of fraud.  It is also important to remember the context for these claims as well as the messengers: All of this comes days before a hearing to potentially dismiss a case seeking to inspect higher resolution scans of Fulton's absentee ballots that many in the pro-Trump sphere are heralding as the doorway to somehow ""forensically audit"" Georgia's votes — a fantasy that is undermining trust in the Republican-picked and Republican-controlled election system ahead of a contentious 2022 statewide election.",Fact Check: Fulton County Is Not Missing Ballots Or Hundreds Of Drop Box Custody Forms,true

Although the bomb crashed through five stories of concrete and the concussion destroyed cars all over that floor, the Secret Service limousine ''did not even have a broken windshield,'' according to a government official on the scene that day. The condition of the limousine after September's attack was not known yesterday. ''We haven't gotten anything back yet,'' Mr. Ball said.  Asked about reports that his agency also kept what looked like ordinary taxis and telephone company trucks in the basement, Mr. Ball laughed. ''What I would say is that it is not unusual for law enforcement agencies to have these kinds of things,'' he said.  Besides the Secret Service, the building named for the United States Customs Service also housed an office of the C.I.A.  That building is now partly collapsed, with a rubble pit 30 feet deep. Somewhere in there are drugs, weapons and contraband seized by the Customs Service at the region's airports. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms also lost two evidence vaults, according to a spokesman for that agency, Joseph Green. They have not yet been recovered.  ''There could be several hundred weapons -- somewhere between 200 and 400, ranging from small-caliber semiautomatic pistols to assault rifles,'' Mr. Green said, adding that a few of the guns had been found. Agents plan to be on the scene when the remains of the building are demolished sometime in the next two weeks, he said.  ''After that, we'll be working at the landfill to search for any important items that are still missing.''

Any pupil who decides they want to switch gender must be supported and listened to in school following the Scottish Government advice.  The guidance applies in primary schools, where the youngest children are only four or five, because ‘recognition and development of gender identity can occur at a young age’.  It also tells teachers not to question a child who says they want to transition to live as a boy or a girl - and instead ask for their new name and pronouns.  Scottish education secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said: ‘This guidance outlines how schools can support transgender young people while ensuring that the rights of all pupils are fully respected'  Schools have been told they do not have to inform parents if a pupil informs them they wish to change gender  Primary and secondary schools have also been told to put books featuring transgender people on the curriculum, allow pupils to choose which changing room or toilets to use, and consider introducing a gender neutral uniform.  But the guidance was branded ‘shocking’ and led to concerns that children are being allowed to make life-changing decisions at too young an age.  The advice says: ‘Some young people are exploring their gender identity in primary school settings. Primary schools need to be able to meet the needs of these young people to ensure they have a safe, inclusive and respectful environment in which to learn.’  A section on ‘changing name and recorded sex’ says children simply need to tell others informally that they want to use a different name, and that they don’t need to record this formally on their official school record. Advice to school staff on what to do if a child wants to discuss their gender includes asking ‘what name and pronoun you should use to address them’.  It also says that they should ask if their family are aware they are considering their gender identity – but does not suggest the teacher should contact them.  The guidance document also states that no Scottish law compels people to use the toilets that correspond to the gender they were assigned at birth.  Marion Calder, director of the For Women Scotland campaign group, said: ‘To be transgender you have to have a diagnosis of gender dysphoria. What are they thinking? Parents will be very concerned to be reading this document.’  Scottish education secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said: ‘This guidance outlines how schools can support transgender young people while ensuring that the rights of all pupils are fully respected.  ‘It provides schools with practical suggestions.

For those vaccinated against COVID-19, antibody levels eventually wane, but this is not the whole story.Credit: Kateryna Kon/Science Photo Library  Six months ago, Miles Davenport and his colleagues made a bold prediction. On the basis of published results from vaccine trials and other data sources, they estimated that people immunized against COVID-19 would lose approximately half of their defensive antibodies every 108 days or so. As a result, vaccines that initially offered, say, 90% protection against mild cases of disease might only be 70% effective after 6 or 7 months1.  “It felt a little bit out on a limb at the time,” says Davenport, a computational immunologist at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia. But on the whole, his group’s predictions have come true.  Immunological studies have documented a steady decline of antibody levels among vaccinated individuals2. Long-term follow-up of vaccine trial participants has revealed a growing risk of breakthrough infection3. And health-care records from countries such as Israel, the United Kingdom and elsewhere all show that COVID-19 vaccines are losing their strength, at least when it comes to keeping a lid on transmissible disease.  That’s without accounting for the Delta threat either — and it’s clear that vaccine–induced antibodies do a worse job at recognizing SARS-CoV-2 variants compared with the ancestral strain of the virus4. What remains unclear, however, is to what degree the immune system’s safeguards that protect vaccinated people against severe disease, hospitalization and death might be fading as well. “That,” says Davenport, “is the million-dollar question at the moment.”  As discussions over booster programmes heat up — with leading global-health authorities coming out publicly against the idea this week, UK officials endorsing boosters for the over-50s, and advisers to US regulators meeting on 17 September to discuss the issue — Nature takes stock of the data informing the debate.  How is vaccine-induced immunity holding up?  “Things wane,” says Nicole Doria-Rose, an immunologist at the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland. But not all things wane equally.  ‘Neutralizing’ antibodies that can intercept viruses before they infiltrate cells might not have much staying power. Levels of these molecules typically shoot up after vaccination, then quickly taper off months later. “That’s how vaccines work,” Doria-Rose says.  But cellular immune responses are longer lasting — and as Jennifer Gommerman, an immunologist at the University of Toronto in Canada, explains: “Cellular immunity is what’s going to protect you from disease.” Memory B cells, which can rapidly deploy more antibodies in the event of re-exposure to the virus, tend to stick around, and so do T cells, which can attack already-infected cells. Both provide an added measure of protection should SARS-CoV-2 sneak past the body’s first line of defence.  In one of the only long-term studies to consider these three planks of the immune system simultaneously — antibodies, B cells and T cells — researchers found that vaccination spurred durable cellular immunity5. Memory B cells continued to grow in numbers for at least six months, and got better at fighting the virus over time. T-cell counts remained relatively stable, dipping only slightly over the duration of the study period.  “So, you have this reserve,” says John Wherry, an immunologist at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine in Philadelphia, who led the study. “Circulating antibodies may be declining, but your immune system is capable of jumping into action once again.”  How can immune memory actually be getting stronger?  Research from immunologist Ali Ellebedy, at Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis, Missouri, helps to explain the vigour of the memory-B-cell response. His group took samples from the lymph nodes of vaccinated individuals and found tiny B-cell finishing schools — called germinal centres — that were churning out ever more potent immune cells as time went on6.  B cells in these structures randomly mutate their genes to create entire new sets of antibodies. Those cells that produce the best antibody repertoires eventually win out through an evolutionary process that augments the immune system’s ability to fight off Delta and other SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.  Ellebedy and his colleagues initially described the persistence of these germinal centres for 15 weeks post-immunization with an RNA-based jab — longer than anyone had ever seen before with older-technology vaccines for other ailments. Now, the researchers have unpublished data, following the germinal centres for up to six months. “The training camp is still going,” Ellebedy says. “It’s amazing.”  Should that immune memory give durable protection against severe disease?  For the most part, it should. But, says Theodora Hatziioannou, a virologist at the Rockefeller University in New York City, “if protection from disease relies at any level on circulating neutralizing antibodies” — and those molecules are clearly on the decline — “then, yes, the longer out you are from natural infection or from vaccination the worse you will be”.  Real-world data from diagnostic-testing records and hospital databases suggest that this might be the case. In Israel, for example, elderly people who got their shots at the beginning of the year seemed to have almost double the risk of severe illness during a July outbreak compared with similar individuals who were immunized more recently7. As researchers reported this week, older individuals given a third dose of vaccine were less likely to become infected and much less likely to develop severe disease than those who had not received the boosters8.  Third-dose COVID-19 vaccine programmes have already begun in Israel, and data about their effectiveness are starting to come in.Credit: Kobi Wolf/Bloomberg via Getty  To Eran Segal, a computational biologist at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel, who advises the Israeli government on COVID-19 issues, the implications are clear-cut. “There’s compelling evidence that the third dose increases protection dramatically.”  But as University of Pennsylvania biostatistician Jeffrey Morris points out, inferences made from observational studies of this kind should be viewed with a critical eye. People going about their everyday lives are not clinical-trial participants. They are not randomized to account for behavioural and demographic differences. And although statistical modelling can help to correct for some of these variables, it’s impossible to account for all potential confounding factors.  “The bottom line,” Morris says, “is we need careful modelling and we need really thorough data to deconvolve all these things.”  What about other countries besides Israel?  Preliminary data from the United Kingdom and Qatar would seem to confirm the Israeli experience. Researchers at Public Health England posted a preprint this week detailing a modest but appreciable dip in vaccine effectiveness against hospital admission and death. This occurred about 20 weeks out from inoculation for recipients both of the mRNA vaccine from Pfizer–BioNTech and the viral vector vaccine from the AstraZeneca — although the effect was most pronounced for older individuals and those with underlying health conditions. Among the elderly, there was also some indication that spacing out the initial two doses of vaccine promoted more durable protective immunity.  Meanwhile, in Qatar, Laith Abu-Raddad and his colleagues described last month how the vaccine from Pfizer–BioNTech had provided consistently high protection against critical illness for up to six months post-immunization. Vaccine effectiveness against mild or symptom-free infections has declined gradually, as expected. But at the time that he posted a preprint online, on 27 August9, Abu-Raddad, an infectious-disease epidemiologist at Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar in Doha, was unsure about the need for booster shots.  Then, he says, he saw the data from seven months post-immunization. Although the results are preliminary, the vaccine’s ability to ward off hospitalization and death seems to drop off. “The data now forced a change in thinking,” says Abu-Raddad. (A comparable study from the United States has so far reported data only on waning protection against infection, not severe disease10.)  Still, globally, there is as yet no indication that the rates of severe illness among the vaccinated are spiking in any appreciable way. “The vaccines are really designed to prevent disease,” says Julie McElrath, an infectious-disease specialist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, Washington. “That is still holding up.”  Even if most vaccinated individuals are not getting really sick, are there other benefits to boosters?  Reducing rates of infection should help break the cycle of viral transmission, which would ultimately result in fewer cases of severe COVID-19 and death. And according to Fyodor Kondrashov, an evolutionary geneticist at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria in Klosterneuburg, it should also help keep the emergence of vaccine-resistant variants at bay.  “Things that are good from the epidemiological perspective,“ he says, “are also good from the evolutionary perspective.”  As Kondrashov’s modelling work has shown, resistant viruses are most likely to emerge when transmission is not controlled11. Getting more people vaccinated is the single most effective intervention to keep transmission rates low, but any bump in vaccine effectiveness can help as well.  So far, no human vaccine has been completely undermined by resistance in the way that many anti-infective drugs have, says Andrew Read, who studies the evolution of infectious diseases at Pennsylvania State University in University Park. “It’s eroded their benefits,” he says, but in ways that have been fixable with tweaks in vaccine design.  That’s not to say it won’t happen with COVID-19 vaccines. “We’re on new territory here,” says Read. The Delta variant took the world by surprise. Evolution — and our immunological responses — could have more surprises in store.  But any discussion around the need for boosters cannot be had in a vacuum. In addition to considerations of immune kinetics among the immunized, there are also issues of vaccine equity and availability to factor in. And as long as vaccinated people are staying out of hospitals and morgues, then to Katrina Lythgoe, an evolutionary epidemiologist at the University of Oxford, UK, theoretical arguments around vaccine resistance are secondary. “In my view,” she says, “apart from people who are particularly vulnerable, efforts should be directed to getting people, globally, vaccinated.”",COVID vaccine immunity is waning — how much does that matter?,true

Gross domestic product grew 0.4 percent in the first full month since England's lifting of Covid restrictions, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said in a statement.  ""The economy picked up in August as bars, restaurants and festivals benefited from the first full month without Covid-19 restrictions in England,"" noted ONS official Darren Morgan.  ""This was offset by falls in health activity with fewer people visiting GPs and less testing and tracing.""  Construction also fell for the second month in a row, as supply issues created shortages of key materials.  - 'Recovery resumes' -  The ""recovery resumes despite supply chain pressures"", concluded KPMG UK economist Yael Selfin.  ""August GDP ... saw decent growth as the economy bounced back while dealing with supply chain issues and labour shortages.""  The UK economy remains 0.8 percent smaller than its pre-coronavirus level.  All lockdown restrictions in England were lifted on July 19, allowing people to visit shops and hospitality venues without having to wear masks.  Yet the ONS also revealed the economy shrank 0.1 percent in July, revising down an initial estimate of 0.1 percent growth.  That marked the first contraction since January when stricter lockdown curbs weighed on activity.  July was hit by downwardly revised data for the automobile and energy sectors, and improvements to how health output is measured.  Car manufacturing was plagued by an ongoing global shortage of microchips.  Britain's economy had rebounded by 5.5 percent in the second quarter, or three months to June.  But the outlook remains clouded by ongoing Brexit and Covid pandemic fallout and supply chain bottlenecks.  Activity has in addition been hit by shortages of lorry drivers, semiconductors and motor fuel, as well as surging oil and gas prices that have sparked elevated inflation.  The outlook also darkened after the government ended its furlough jobs support scheme and cut back Universal Credit welfare support.  - Recovery facing headwinds -  ""The recovery is certainly facing more headwinds,"" added EY economist Martin Beck.  ""Rising inflation, driven by significant increases in energy prices, and the recent cut in Universal Credit are squeezing consumers' spending power.  ""And continued supply-side disruption and the narrative around shortages, whether real or not, will hold back activity and sentiment.""  Paul Dales, chief UK economist at research consultancy Capital Economics, warned the economy might flatline as a result of supply bottlenecks.  ""Shortages may bite harder in the coming months,"" he added.  ""The recent broadening in shortages and the fuel crisis may mean that growth has come to a near-standstill since August.""

284,338194240429171837821224895361886554558,"The QAnon conspiracy theory has been linked to several violent acts since 2018, with QAnon supporters arrested for threatening politicians, breaking into the residence of the Canadian prime minister, an armed standoff near the Hoover dam, a kidnapping plot and two kidnappings, and at least one murder.  QAnon adherents believe that Donald Trump is trying to save the world from a cabal of satanic pedophiles. The conspiracy theory’s narrative includes centuries-old antisemitic tropes, like the belief that the cabal is harvesting blood from abused children, and it names specific people, including Democratic politicians and Hollywood celebrities, as participants in a global plot. Experts call these extreme, baseless claims “an incitement to violence”.  The conspiracy theory’s claims have put ordinary people at risk. The FBI identified QAnon in 2019 as a potential domestic terror threat and the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point described it as a “novel challenge to public security”.  QAnon supporters believe that there will soon be mass arrests, and members of the cabal will be brought to justice. If supporters of the conspiracy theory begin to lose faith in Trump’s ability to stop the cabal of child abusers, said Travis View, one of the hosts of the QAnon Anonymous podcast, that might inspire them to begin taking more direct violent action themselves.  “QAnon has not brought a single child abuser closer to justice,” View said. “But QAnon has radicalized people into committing crimes and taking dangerous or violent actions that put children at risk.”  Here is a list of violent and criminal acts linked to QAnon:  15 June 2018: An Arizona resident blocks a bridge near the Hoover Dam with an armored vehicle. He later pleads guilty to a terrorism charge.  Matthew Wright was unhappy that Trump had not yet made the mass arrests QAnon supporters had anticipated, the Arizona Republic reported. Police said Wright had two military-style rifles, two handguns and 900 rounds of ammunition in his vehicle, according to the Associated Press. In 2020, Wright pleaded guilty to a terrorism charge, but a judge rejected a plea deal that would have given him less than 10 years in prison as too lenient.  The Hoover dam. Photograph: eye35.pix/Alamy Stock Photo/Alamy Stock Photo  From jail, Wright later wrote letters to Trump and other elected officials that included one of the slogans of the QAnon movement, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported.  19 December 2018: A California man is arrested after being found with what appeared to be bomb-making materials in his car, in an alleged plot to blow up a satanic display in the capitol in Springfield, Illinois.  “The man allegedly was planning to ‘blow up a satanic temple monument’ in the Capitol rotunda in Springfield, Illinois, to ‘make Americans aware of Pizzagate and the New World Order’,” Yahoo News reported, citing an FBI intelligence briefing that described the incident. Illinois officials were notified of the threat at the time, the Peoria Journal-Star reported.  13 March 2019: In Staten Island, a 24-year-old man allegedly murders a leader in the Gambino crime family.  Anthony Comello’s lawyer has said that the 24-year-old man “ardently believed that Francesco Cali, a boss in the Gambino crime family, was a prominent member of the deep state, and, accordingly, an appropriate target for a citizen’s arrest”, the New York Times reported. “Mr Comello became certain that he was enjoying the protection of President Trump himself, and that he had the president’s full support,” the lawyer wrote.  Weeks before the alleged killing, Comello was in New York City, attempting to make a citizen’s arrest of the city’s mayor, as well as the Democratic congresspeople Maxine Waters and Adam Schiff, the Staten Island Advance reported. In June 2020, Comello was found mentally unfit to stand trial.  25 September 2019: A QAnon supporter allegedly smashes up the Chapel of the Holy Hill in Sedona, Arizona, while shouting about the Catholic church supporting human trafficking.  Timothy Larson, 41, was arrested a few hours after the incident, Red Rock News reported. Larson used QAnon hashtags on social media and referred to vandalizing the church as a “mission”, the local police chief said, according to the Arizona Republic.

Colorado child welfare officials had removed Cynthia Abcug’s son from her custody in the spring of 2019, the Daily Beast reported. Her daughter told law enforcement that her mother and her mother’s friends were QAnon believers and that they were planning a kidnapping raid, the Daily Beast reported.  Abcug’s daughter also told police that her brother’s foster family were referred to as pedophiles and “evil Satan worshippers”, apparent references to the QAnon conspiracy theory, the Associated Press reported.  Abcug eventually left Colorado and traveled across the country, receiving assistance from a network of QAnon supporters, a Daily Beast investigation found, before she was arrested in Montana.  In September 2020, Abcug pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to commit second-degree kidnapping.  26 March 2020: A Kentucky mother is charged with kidnapping twin daughters.  Neely Blanchard, a Kentucky woman linked to both the anti-government sovereign citizen movement and QAnon conspiracy theories, was arrested after taking her children from their grandmother, their legal guardian, the Daily Beast reported.  Law enforcement reportedly used cellphone data to locate Blanchard at the home of a group of anti-government extremists, a local sheriff told the Daily Beast. Blanchard had previously been charged with kidnapping another daughter from her school in 2013.  Blanchard had used sovereign citizen ideology to argue that she should legally have custody of her children, the Daily Beast reported.  “QAnon is popular on the sovereign citizen child custody groups, in part because its believers claim that the government and child protective agencies are abusing the children they take from their parents’ custody,” wrote the Daily Beast reporter Will Sommer, who has published in-depth investigations of several kidnapping cases with links to QAnon.  2 April 2020: A man is charged with intentionally derailing a freight train near the navy hospital ship Mercy in Los Angeles.  Eduardo Moreno, a train engineer from San Pedro, California, “admitted during an interview that he had run the train beyond the track because he believed the Mercy was part of suspicious activities involving the coronavirus”, according to prosecutors, the Los Angeles Times reported.  The USNS Mercy hospital ship as it leaves Los Angeles harbor in May. Photograph: AP  “In a second interview with FBI agents, Moreno, 44, said ‘he did it out of the desire to ‘wake people up,’ according to the affidavit,” NBC News reported. “‘Moreno stated that he thought that the USNS Mercy was suspicious and did not believe “the ship is what they say it’s for”.’”  While Moreno did not explicitly mention the QAnon conspiracy theory as a justification for the attack, many of the statements he made after his arrest “seem related to QAnon”, an analysis from the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point noted.  30 April 2020: A woman is arrested after driving to New York and allegedly making threatening statements against Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton.  Jessica Prim, who posted about multiple QAnon conspiracy theories online, livestreamed her drive from Illinois to New York on Facebook. A post on her Facebook page read: “Hillary Clinton and her assistant, Joe Biden and Tony Podesta need to be taken out in the name of Babylon! I can’t be set free without them gone,” the Rock River Times, an independent Illinois newspaper, reported.  Prim, 37, said she was driving to the USNS Comfort, another hospital ship docked in New York because of coronavirus, but ended up arrested outside a historical aircraft carrier, the Intrepid, the New York Post reported. Police said they found multiple knives in her vehicle. “I was watching the press conferences with Donald Trump on TV. I felt like he was talking to me,” Prim reportedly said. “I felt like I was supposed to come to Comfort and get some help because I felt like I was the coronavirus.”  11 June 2020: A Boston man leads police on a 20-mile car chase while livestreaming himself talking about QAnon.  “Donald Trump, I need a miracle or something,” Alpalus Slyman said during his 11 June car chase across Massachusetts and New Hampshire, in remarks captured on a livestream, the Daily Beast reported. “QAnon, help me. QAnon, help me!”  The 29-year-old man’s five children, ages 13, five, two, one and eight months, were also in the car, “in distress and needing help”, police said, according to NBC Boston. “We don’t want to die,” one of his daughters screamed at one point, the Union Leader reported.  “Slyman warned his children during the chase that the police were coming to abduct them – or maybe just shoot them in a staged killing,” the Daily Beast reported. He also accused his wife and daughter of being part of the plot. The oldest daughter posted about what was happening on social media during the car chase, according to the Union Leader. Their mother had reportedly jumped out of the car, afraid of her husband’s behavior.  Slyman eventually crashed, but his children were not hurt. He faced multiple charges related to the chase.  3 July 2020: Corey Hurren, a reservist in the Canadian Rangers, allegedly rams a truck through the gates of the prime minister’s residence in Ottawa.  Hurren was inside the grounds for 13 minutes before authorities spotted him. He is “also accused of uttering a threat to ‘cause death or bodily harm’ to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who was not home at the time”, CBC reported.  A police officer stands near a damaged gate at Rideau Hall, where Justin Trudeau lives. Photograph: Patrick Doyle/Reuters  “An hour before entering the grounds of Rideau hall, GrindHouse Fine Foods, the sausage-making company Hurren runs, posted a picture of an outdoor party that would occur after the lockdown, directing people to to look up ‘Event 201’. The reference was to a conspiracy theory that Bill Gates, the Microsoft co-founder, was responsible for the Covid-19 pandemic,” the Guardian reported.  Hurren’s company also posted a QAnon meme to Instagram in March, according to reporting from Vice News. “Has anyone else been following ‘Q’ and the ‘White Rabbit’ down the rabbit hole and how this all relates to the coronavirus/Covid-19 situation? Lots of coincidences in all these ‘Q’ posts if this turns out to be a ‘Nothingburger’,” the caption said.”  12 August 2020: A Texas woman is arrested after allegedly chasing and crashing into a car, then telling police she thought she was chasing a pedophile  Cecilia Fulbright, 30, was arrested in Waco, Texas, after two drivers reported being chased by another driver, and one reported being repeatedly rammed by another vehicle, the Waco Tribune-Herald reported. Officers said Fulbright told them afterwards that she believed the driver whose car she hit was a pedophile and that she was rescuing a young girl from being trafficked, the paper reported. Her blood alcohol level at the time was more than double the legal limit.  Two of Fulbright’s acquaintances told Right Wing Watch that she had become deeply absorbed in the QAnon conspiracy theory, including talking about how Trump was “literally taking down the cabal and the pedophile ring” and that she continued to describe herself as a follower of QAnon even after her arrest.  1 October 2020: Utah woman arrested in Oregon for allegedly kidnapping her young son  Emily Jolley allegedly fled with her six-year-old son, whose father has sole legal custody, after a supervised visit, and was later located in Oregon, where she was arrested, KUTV reported.  Like Blanchard, the Kentucky mother, Jolley was described by a Utah law enforcement official as a member of the anti-government sovereign citizens movement, KUTV reported. Her social media profiles were also full of references to Trump and QAnon, the Daily Beast reported, including a link to an article claiming that Child Protective Services steals children to drain them of a special substance drunk by members of a global cabal that runs the world, a central element of the QAnon conspiracy theory.",QAnon: a timeline of violence linked to the conspiracy theory,true

Clinical trials showed the vaccine, which delivers instructions to the body to help the immune system identify and destroy Covid-19 molecules, is more than 95 percent effective.      MODERNA    Another mRNA vaccine, with a 94.1-percent efficacy rate, has been approved for use in the EU, North America, Britain, and several other nations, including Israel and Singapore.      ASTRAZENECA/OXFORD    This viral vector vaccine is authorised for use in the EU, Britain and other countries such as India.    It was shown to be 60 percent effective in trials, but a relative lack of safety and efficacy data among older participants has led several countries to recommend against administering the vaccine to those over 65.      SPUTNIK V    Russia's vaccine works in a similar way to the AstraZeneca/Oxford jab, but has a 91.6-percent efficacy according to trial results.    More than a dozen nations have authorised its use, including Belarus, Armenia, Iran, Algeria, Argentina, South Korea and Venezuela.    Its makers have begun the process of asking for approval from the European Medicines Agency. Hungary is the sole EU member state that has started administering doses.      SINOPHARM    Two vaccines developed in China use the traditional technique of injecting the deactivated virus in order to trigger an immune response.    As well as the United Arab Emirates, Hungary, Cambodia, Peru and Zimbabwe have all started administering the vaccine, which its makers say is 79 percent effective.      SINOVAC    The other Chinese-developed vaccine uses a similar technique and is authorised for use in China, Chile, Brazil and Turkey.    Others such as Ukraine and Uruguay have pre-ordered doses.    Its makers say it is 50 percent effective against Covid-19 (and 80 percent effective against severe illness), but trial results have not yet been made public.      JOHNSON & JOHNSON    The US pharma giant has asked for emergency use authorisation for its single-shot vaccine in the US and EU.    South Africa became the first country to begin administering the Johnson & Johnson vaccine after saying it would prioritise its procurement over the AstraZeneca jab.    Trials showed it to be 66 percent effective against Covid-19 and up to 85 percent effective against serious forms of infection.      BHARAT BIOTECH    This inactivated virus vaccine is used currently in India.      CANSINO    A Chinese-made viral vector vaccine was authorised for use in Mexico last week, but has not yet been administered to the public.      - Authorisation pending  Story continues  NOVAVAX    This American vaccine is under rolling review by the EMA, which has the ultimate say on EU medical authorisations.    It is based on ""sub-unit"" proteins that trigger an immune response without delivering the whole virus.    Its makers say it is 89.3 percent effective.      CUREVAC    The German vaccine entered EMA review last week. It uses similar technology to the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech jabs.        - Still in development  The World Health Organization says there are currently 69 vaccines against the novel coronavirus in human trials.

286,52805173419674617548158417719191824311,"Texas lifted its mask mandate and capacity restrictions on restaurants and other businesses Wednesday, despite experts warning the ""100 percent"" relaxation of coronavirus curbs will exacerbate the spread of worrying variants.  The Lone Star State became the fifth to rescind its face covering order in a sign of increasing optimism about the pandemic in the world's hardest hit country, where the infection rate has fallen dramatically since January but still remains high in absolute terms.  ""It is now time to open Texas 100 percent,"" said Governor Greg Abbott when he announced his plans to ease restrictions last week.  The Texas Rangers meanwhile are set to become the first major US professional sports team to welcome back a capacity crowd after announcing ticketing plans for the upcoming baseball season on Wednesday.  The Rangers said their 40,300-capacity ballpark would operate at full capacity for two exhibition games against Milwaukee on March 29-30 and the season opener against the Toronto Blue Jays on April 5.  The moves came as the immunization campaign was gathering momentum, with 62 million people so far receiving one or more doses -- about 19 percent of the adult population -- and Alaska became the first state to open up the shots to anyone aged 16 or over.  The White House on Wednesday announced plans to acquire 100 million more vaccines from Johnson & Johnson, giving the United States contingency capacity as it targets inoculating the adult population of 270 million people by May.  ""We need maximum flexibility, there's always a chance that we'll encounter unexpected challenges, or there'll be a new need for a vaccination effort,"" said President Joe Biden, explaining the decision.  He added: ""If we have a surplus, we're going to share it with the rest of the world,"" stressing the US had committed $4 billion to Covax, the global initiative to distribute vaccines to lower-income countries.  Story continues  Biden said he would launch the next phase of the country's Covid response in a primetime address Thursday.  - Texans mixed on masks -  In downtown Houston, the biggest city of the nation's second most populous state, the overwhelming majority of people continued to wear their masks despite the new order.  Businessman Omar Abu-Shaaban called the move a politically motivated nod to the governor's anti-science Republican base.  ""I don't think he had the health of the people in mind,"" he said.  But 22-year-old Kade Phillips told AFP he supported the decision.  ""I think it's good for everyone to be able to make their own choice and what they choose for their body,"" he said.  Popular grocery chains had already said they would keep their mask orders in place, while cities can also keep the orders on municipal buildings and there are also no changes to the rule on federal property.  Support for mask measures is strongly divided along political lines, with people in more conservative and rural parts of the country more likely to view them as an affront to personal freedom.  - Celebrating too early? -  More than 529,000 Americans have died from Covid-19 but while cases have declined dramatically since the January 11 peak, the infection rate has been plateauing since the last week of February at around 60,000 new cases per day.  Peter Hotez, a professor at the Baylor College of Medicine, tweeted he was worried about a ""perfect storm"" coming to Texas with the lifting of the mask mandate, one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country, rising cases of the B.1.1.7 variant first seen in Britain, an uptick in the test positivity rate and spring break.  In Maryland, which borders the capital Washington, Governor Larry Hogan announced that effective Friday the state would lift capacity limits on both outdoor and indoor dining, retail businesses and places of worship and allow large outdoor and indoor venues to begin operating at 50 percent capacity.  And Los Angeles and southern California will be allowed to partially reopen indoor dining and movie theaters from this weekend, Governor Gavin Newsom said, as the region hit key health criteria.  Hotez cautioned against a ""national race to the bottom"" adding that while the United States doesn't have enough vaccines yet, it will in two months' time.  ""We don't have to needlessly lose American lives in the spring of 2021,"" he said.  str-ia/ec",Texas reopens '100%' as US vaccination drive gains pace,true

U.S. vaccinations tracker › How many have been vaccinated, and who’s eligible  Vaccine doses remain relatively scarce globally. But concerns around waning immunity have prompted many countries, including the United States and Israel, to start administering additional doses.  Additional doses include booster doses given to fully vaccinated individuals when the protection from the original shots has begun to decline, as well as extra shots given to people, such as the immunocompromised, who did not have a strong immune response from their initial doses. More than 1.71 billion additional doses have been administered worldwide, with many more countries expected to start administering them soon.  Tracking vaccination rates by country Charts show countries with at least 100,000 people  Less wealthy countries are relying on a vaccine-sharing arrangement called Covax, which originally aimed to provide two billion doses by the end of 2021 but repeatedly cut its forecasts because of production problems, export bans and vaccine hoarding by wealthy nations.

288,218910857940164763782025329110698806335,"A pause on all US vaccinations with the Johnson & Johnson Covid shot will continue for at least another week after members of a government-convened expert panel said Wednesday they needed more time to assess its possible links to a clotting disorder.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) convened a meeting a day after authorities reported six cases of women developing brain clots along with low blood platelet counts, including one death, within two weeks of people getting the one-dose Covid-19 vaccine.  The shot has been given to some 7.2 million Americans, and participants at the meeting were told on Wednesday a seventh case involving a 28-year-old woman has been identified.  Wednesday's meeting could have decided whether to limit the vaccine to some subsets of the population, but most members said they were not yet comfortable in making that call without more data to study.  ""I don't want to send the message that there is something fundamentally wrong with this vaccine,"" said Beth Bell, chair of the working group.  ""But I want to be able to understand and defend the decision that I've made based on a reasonable amount of data,"" she added.  The next meeting has not yet been set but is expected in another week to ten days.  Some experts were against continuing the pause, fearing it might disproportionately impact vulnerable groups that are easier to reach through a single-dose vaccine that can be stored in fridges.  But most felt that given the highly serious nature of the clots, which can have devastating neurological consequences even when they do not kill, and given the abundance in the United States of other vaccines that do not have the same safety concern, further study was necessary.  The presentations revealed that of the first six cases identified, all were white females, none had previously known clotting disorders, and one was using estrogen/progesterone, taken to mean oral contraceptive.  Story continues  The woman who died was 45, and three of the women also had clots outside the brain.  Though the link to the vaccine has yet to be conclusively determined, scientists are now treating the shot as the ""probable cause"" of the disorder, which has been dubbed ""vaccine induced immune thrombocytopenia"" or ""VIIT.""  Ahead of the meeting, CDC director Rochelle Walensky said the symptoms are consistent with rare side effects from the AstraZeneca vaccine seen in Europe.  Both the J&J and AstraZeneca vaccines are based on adenovirus vector technology, which is now under scrutiny.  Other Covid adenovirus vector vaccines include Russia's Sputnik V and China's CanSino.  People who received the J&J vaccine are being urged to report if they experience symptoms including severe headache, abdominal pain, leg pain or shortness of breath.  Doctors meanwhile have been told not to treat such clots with the common thinner heparin.  Four of the initial six cases were treated using heparin, and this might have made their condition worse, according to the leading biological hypothesis for what is driving the effect.  Cases involving clots together with low platelets have not been linked to the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, which are based on messenger RNA technology.  When the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices reconvenes, it could potentially vote to recommend that only people beyond a certain age receive the J&J vaccine.  The reasoning is that the older people get, the more they risk developing a serious form of Covid, and the more it is in their interest to be vaccinated despite potential side effects.  But US officials have also emphasized that they have more than enough supply lined up of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines to cover the adult population by the end of July, which could make giving the J&J shot the green light again unnecessary.  ia/dw",US J&J Covid vaccine pause continues after experts defer vote,true

There are already some suits filed claiming wrongful deaths in long-term care homes, a lack of disability coverage for so-called COVID ""long haulers"" with lingering symptoms and a class action suit claiming the government's masking laws are violating constitutional rights.  A class action suit filed by Ottawa lawyer Michael Swinwood is going even further.  ""It's a challenge to what is being put before humanity,"" he says.  ""We're saying straight up that there is no justification for the declaration of a pandemic ... I'd go so far as to say that what medical science says is that this is no worse than a seasonal flu.""  Ottawa lawyer Michael Swinwood is behind a class action lawsuit claiming that the Canadian and Ontario governments don't have the ""lawful authority"" to impose COVID restrictions on the public. (Micki Cowan/CBC)  The suit is filed against the Canadian and Ontario governments, individual political leaders, as well as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the World Health Organization and the Pope.  It claims that all the defendants allowed for the bringing in of COVID restrictions and shutdowns ""without lawful authority and due process on behalf of the mind, body and health of the Canadian Public.""  The class of Ontario claimants includes the owner of a convenience store in Henvey Inlet First Nation south of Sudbury, a small business owner in Peterborough, a man living with disabilities in Balderson and a single mother in downtown Toronto.  Each is seeking $1 million, as are the likely millions of ""John and Jane Does"" named in the suit representing everyone else affected by the pandemic.  Swinwood says he expects the governments will claim the suit is ""frivolous and vexatious"" but ""that doesn't matter, the facts are all there.""  The Ontario government is trying to limit COVID lawsuits, with a law passed in November forbidding claims against employers and others who make an ""honest effort"" to follow guidelines and prevent spread of the virus.  Elizabeth Keenan— an employment lawyer with Matthews, Dinsdale and Clark in Toronto— says what exactly that means is ""the big question"" that will have to be tested in court.  ""One would imagine that there's a purpose in using that language,"" she says.

Over the last month, major U.S. air carriers Delta and United Airlines said that they would require new employees to show proof that they’ve been vaccinated against the coronavirus, citing it as a move to further safeguard its employees and customers.  The airline industry has been among the hardest hit over the course of the pandemic, shedding thousands of jobs and billions of dollars of revenue since the onset of COVID-19.  4:06 Pressure mounts on Canada to come up with a travel restart plan Pressure mounts on Canada to come up with a travel restart plan – May 13, 2021  Story continues below advertisement  But now, as vaccination rates continue to ramp up across many parts of the world, including in Canada, many airlines have begun to announce a reopening of air routes and rehiring of their employees.  Last Thursday, Air Canada said it would begin recalling over 2,600 employees across various roles in preparation for a surge in demand for flights.  While none of the Canadian airlines have announced or made public any plans to mandate COVID-19 vaccines in returning or newly hired employees, several public health and travel experts have pointed to the move as a step in the right direction.  2:34 Why more Canadians are taking life on the road during the pandemic Why more Canadians are taking life on the road during the pandemic – Jun 14, 2021  Dr. Jason Kindrachuk, a virologist at the University of Manitoba, told Global News in an interview Sunday that mandating vaccinations for workers in the travel industry, which offers vectors of “massive” virus transmission, is an option that should really be considered.  Story continues below advertisement  Kindrachuk said the travel industry in Canada has for the most part done relatively well in managing its transmissions, despite people travelling together in enclosed spaces like airplanes.  “That being said, you don’t need to have a lot of transmissions to have concerns. We really need to have one or two cases that ultimately lead to the initiation of new COVID transmissions, and that’s the concern,” he said.  Any way to reduce the risk of transmitting the virus, like vaccinating employees, should be an important factor in deciding new policies or mandates, he said.  Kindrachuk’s comments come after recent federal data pointed to domestic flights in Canada accounting for 80 per cent of COVID-19 cases among air travellers.  The data, released last month, revealed that 226 domestic flights between April and May of this year had at least one person who tested positive for COVID-19, compared to the 50 planes with positive cases entering Canada internationally.  Canada has over the last year and half imposed stringent measures on international travel to the country, including a flight an from India and Pakistan over concerns rising COVID-19 cases. The same level of restrictions, however, do not apply to passengers travelling domestically.

Experts have previously warned of the threat the variant poses to big provincial reopening plans.  “We’re in a position, unfortunately, that the virus now is much better [at spreading] than it was even a year ago — even six months ago,” said Kindrachuk of the Delta variant.  “So we don’t have that same ability to implement things like masking and distancing to try and combat the virus anymore because there are ways for that virus to just be able to be transmitted at a higher rate.”  Story continues below advertisement  According to Toronto-based employment lawyer Andrew Monkhouse, any move to mandate vaccinations could be met with a slew of ethical — and legal — implications.  While Canada doesn’t have a law in place preventing businesses from requiring people to be vaccinated, any requests to do so could potentially be challenged by individuals on the basis of Canadian human rights law, he said.  Monkhouse said that what he expects to see in place from most airlines, and even others in the consumer industry, is a system that generally requires its employees to be vaccinated, but can potentially accommodate on a case-by-case basis, whether it’s due to health or reasons or beliefs that prevent them from getting the vaccine.  “I certainly think airlines, because it’s a customer safety issue and also, frankly, getting people trying to get people back on planes, they need a certain volume to make money. You have to have a full plane, so certainly we’re going to see that,” saidMonkhouse said, adding that he’s even started to see a preference for vaccinated employees to return to work in retail.

Health Canada did not have a statement ready by time of publication.  A spokesperson from WestJet did not specifically comment on whether they would consider mandating vaccines for their employees, but added their chief medical officer was continuing to drive awareness of vaccinations “both internally and externally, in the effort to inform and educate WestJetters.”  Canadian airlines Sunwing and Air Transat did not respond to requests asking whether or not they were considering enforcing vaccine mandates on employees or customers.  Story continues below advertisement  According to Marty Firestone, president of Travel Secure, the concept of fully vaccinating airline employees and others in the travel industry is one that is “absolutely paramount” to the industry’s reopening.  “If you’re suggesting that potentially an employee or an airline person that could come in contact with me, from any agent to a flight attendant to a baggage handler, may not want to have both shots and be there working is a pretty scary thought,” said Firestone.  Firestone, who is a specialist in travel insurance and safety, said that knowing whether or not airline employees or others on the plane have had their two shots would make his clients feel much more comfortable to fly and travel again.  5:32 Emerging travel trends and preferences post-pandemic Emerging travel trends and preferences post-pandemic – Jun 10, 2021  He added that many insurance companies were also beginning to recognize and incentivize those with vaccinations.

Go Nakamura | Getty Images News | Getty Images.  Delta 'greatest threat' to U.S.  The first thing to note is how quickly the delta variant spread across the U.K. In a relatively short amount of time, the strain supplanted the alpha variant to become dominant in the country (in mid-June delta was responsible for 90% of all infections, a government study showed) — and this happened despite the U.K.'s advanced vaccination rate. Meanwhile, cases attributed to the delta strain now make up around 20% of newly diagnosed cases in the U.S. according to White House chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci. Fauci warned last week that the delta variant is set to become the dominant Covid strain in the country in a matter of weeks, citing the U.K. as precedent. ""It just exploded in the U.K. It went from a minor variant to now more than 90% of the isolates in the U.K.,"" Fauci said on NBC's ""TODAY"" show. He said the variant has a doubling time of about two weeks. ""So you would expect, just the doubling time, you know, in several weeks to a month or so it's going to be quite dominant, that's the sobering news,"" he added. Read more: Fauci says delta accounts for 20% of new cases and will be dominant Covid variant in U.S. in weeks Fauci had already warned that delta appears to be ""following the same pattern"" as alpha. ""Similar to the situation in the U.K., the delta variant is currently the greatest threat in the U.S. to our attempt to eliminate Covid-19,"" he said. In the U.K., infections attributed to delta have spread rapidly among young people and anyone older who has not yet been vaccinated. Similarly, in the U.S., there are concerns that delta could rapidly spread in parts of the South where vaccinations have stalled, NBC News reported Sunday.  The U.S. is not alone in its concern over the delta variant. In Australia, Sydney was put under a two week lockdown over the weekend amid a growing outbreak of the strain. The Australian government's Covid response team is set to meet Monday to discuss the spread of the virus and the possibility of more restrictions.  Vaccination rush  New outbreaks of infections largely blamed on the delta variant have prompted the U.K.'s government to speed up the last leg of its immunization program for people aged 18 and over. It's hoped that stepping up vaccinations will help stop the wild spread of the strain. Analysis from Public Health England released June 21 showed that two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech or the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccines are highly effective against hospitalization from the delta variant. To date, almost 60% of all U.K. adults have received two doses of the vaccine, while in the U.S., 56% of the population over 18 has been fully vaccinated. The U.K. has not yet authorized Covid shots for adolescents, unlike the U.S. which is giving vaccines to the over-12s.

The latest grim milestone comes as the country is experiencing a fourth-wave driven by the highly contagious Delta variant, with low vaccination uptake in many regions the main cause of death.  Johns Hopkins University tracker showed 675,722 US coronavirus deaths as of Friday, which surpasses the 675,000 US deaths during the influenza outbreak that began in the last year of World War I.  All told, some 50 million died worldwide in the flu pandemic -- sometimes inaccurately referred to as the ""Spanish flu"" -- making it the deadliest event in human history, according to epidemiologists.  That far exceeds global Covid deaths so far -- around 4.7 million.  But the United States has borne a disproportionate 14 percent of those fatalities, despite making up only five percent of the world's population.  The American population in 1918 was less than a third of what it is now, meaning the flu deaths would be equivalent to some 2.2 million in today's terms.  Unlike today's influenzas, which impact children and the elderly the most, the 1918 flu caused unusually high mortality among young adults.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with no vaccines and no antibiotics for secondary bacterial complications, control efforts were limited in the 1918-19 to non-pharmaceutical measures.  These included ""isolation, quarantine, good personal hygiene, use of disinfectants, and limitations of public gatherings,"" it said.  Many of the same measures, including face masks, were recommended when the Covid pandemic began.  Now, however, there are also multiple safe and highly effective vaccines that were developed and tested in record-time -- but 24 percent of US adults, or almost 60 million, haven't yet gotten their first dose.  Uptake has been hit by a polarized political climate and what experts call an epistemological crisis, with misinformation supercharging vaccine hesitancy to historically new heights.  Beyond vaccines, effective treatments have been developed such as monoclonal antibodies, corticosteroids to dial down hyperactive immune responses in patients with severe Covid, and advanced ventilators.

The move comes as scientists and health experts grapple with how to beat back the surging Delta variant of the coronavirus, and follows extensive debate over whether a third injection of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines would be appropriate.  Stressing this was ""no time to let our guard down,"" Biden urged every American 18 and older to get a booster eight months after becoming fully vaccinated.  ""This will boost your immune response, it will increase your protection from Covid-19, and it's the best way to protect ourselves from new variants that could arise,"" Biden said in an address from the White House.  ""It will make you safer, and for longer -- and it will help us end the pandemic faster.""  According to the plan, which is still pending a final evaluation by the Food and Drug Administration, the boosters would become available beginning the week of September 20.  Biden also unveiled a new facet in the push to increase vaccination rates: mandating nursing homes to require all workers be fully vaccinated as a condition for receiving federal funding for social safety net programs like Medicare.  The president highlighted how vaccination rates of the nation's 1.3 million nursing home workers ""significantly trail"" the rest of the country.  Earlier in the day the nation's top health authorities described how ""waning immunity"" after receiving vaccinations and the strength of the widespread Delta variant were necessitating a booster for most Americans.  ""We are concerned that this pattern of decline we are seeing will continue in the months ahead, which could lead to reduced protection against severe disease, hospitalization and death,"" US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said in a video press conference.  Story continues  Murthy and other members of the White House Covid-19 response team said that while vaccines remain remarkably effective, the best way to shore up protection is through a booster.  They said they also anticipate booster shots will be needed eventually for people who received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which rolled out in March.  - Waning immunity -  More than 620,000 people have died in the United States from Covid-19, with case numbers increasing sharply in recent months due to the spread of the Delta variant.  Just over 50 percent of Americans are fully vaccinated, as the country's mass immunization program faces resistance in politically conservative regions in the South and Midwest and among some racial minorities.  Anthony Fauci, the country's leading infectious disease expert, pointed to studies showing significant drops in vaccine protection over time.  For instance, figures released by the Mayo Clinic showed that the effectiveness against the Delta variant slid from 76 to 42 percent with Pfizer's vaccine, and from 86 to 76 percent with Moderna's.  But a booster dose would increase the antibody levels in Covid vaccines tenfold, according to Fauci.  ""Higher levels of antibodies are associated with higher levels of vaccine efficacy,"" he told reporters.  Biden also addressed the concerns recently expressed by foreign leaders that a massive booster effort for Americans would come at the expense of billions of people worldwide who have yet to receive any coronavirus vaccine.  ""I disagree,"" the president said. ""We can take care of America and help the world at the same time.""  While the government gears up to administer some 100 million booster shots in the United States, it will be donating more than 200 million additional doses to other countries.  Overall, the US plans to donate more than 600 million vaccines worldwide.  la-mlm/st",Biden urges Covid booster to counter waning vaccine efficacy,true

Around 52 percent of the American population is fully vaccinated, but health authorities have hit a wall of vaccine hesitant people, impeding the national campaign.  In a televised address, President Joe Biden called FDA approval the ""gold standard"" in evidence.  ""Today I'm calling on... more companies in the private sector to step up with vaccine requirements that will reach millions more people,"" he said.  Pfizer's vaccine, which will now be marketed under its brand name Comirnaty, is the first to receive full approval.  More than 200 million Pfizer shots have already been administered under an emergency use authorization (EUA) that was granted on December 11, 2020.  The decision to fully approve it among people aged 16 and up was based on updated data from the drug's clinical trial involving more than 40,000 people, which found the vaccine 91 percent effective in preventing Covid.  The FDA tracked data from 12,000 vaccine recipients six months out from their vaccine series.  Most commonly reported side effects were mild and included pain and swelling at the injection site as well as headache, chills and fever.  The agency is continuing to investigate safety data regarding the highly rare but more worrisome condition myocarditis (heart inflammation), particularly within seven days after the second dose.  The highest risk has been detected in boys aged 12 through 17, with available data suggesting most individuals recover but some require intensive care.  - Military, NYC announce mandates -  The US military said shortly after the announcement that it would mandate the vaccine, and a slew of private businesses and universities are expected to follow.  New York City also said it would require all its department of education employees to receive at least one dose of vaccine by September 27, without the option for regular testing instead.  Story continues  The vaccine remains available under emergency use authorization to children aged 12 to 15, but because it has now been fully approved, physicians may prescribe it to children under 12 if they believe it will be beneficial.  But Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock recommended against so called ""off-label"" use in younger children until clinical trials report their data, which is expected later this year.  ""We need to get the information and data on usage in younger children -- they are not just small adults,"" she told reporters, emphasizing that knowing the correct dosage for this group was key.  - Boost for vaccination campaign -  Experts hailed the development, which many had been urging for months.  Amesh Adalja of the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security hailed the development as ""good news"" that may sway people still on the fence.  ""One of the talking points of the anti-vaccine movement which has falsely claimed that this was an 'experimental vaccine' has been removed,"" he told AFP.  Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, added he expected to see ""tens of millions more Americans vaccinated"" as a result of new mandates.  A recent survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation found 30 percent of adults said full approval would make them more likely to get vaccinated.  The approval came as the ultra-contagious Delta variant pummels the country, with around 80,000 Americans hospitalized with Covid and more than 700 dying every day.  The hardest hit regions include southern states Florida, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana.  The vaccination rate has risen in these states in recent weeks, but the national rate is still well below its peak from spring.  Some 628,000 people have died from coronavirus infection in the United States, making it officially the hardest hit country in the world -- though experts say it is possible that India may in fact hold the record.  Vaccines are less effective against the Delta variant than they were against previous strains, particularly against infection, making the goal of high population level vaccination critical.  The Biden administration announced last week plans to make a booster shot immediately available for immuno-compromised people, and recommended all vaccinated people get a third shot eight months after their second.  ia/dw","US grants Pfizer Covid vaccine full approval, triggering new mandates",true
296,118335014210668826195212962301215679596,"Donald Trump is a man consumed with grievance against people he believes have betrayed him, but few betrayals have enraged him more than what his attorney general did to him. To Trump, the unkindest cut of all was when William Barr stepped forward and declared that there had been no widespread fraud in the 2020 election, just as the president was trying to overturn Joe Biden’s victory by claiming that the election had been stolen.  In a series of interviews with me this spring, Barr spoke, for the first time, about the events surrounding his break with Trump. I have also spoken with other senior officials in the Trump White House and Justice Department, who provided additional details about Barr’s actions and the former president’s explosive response. Barr and those close to him have a reason to tell his version of this story. He has been widely seen as a Trump lackey who politicized the Justice Department. But when the big moment came after the election, he defied the president who expected him to do his bidding.  Barr’s betrayal came on December 1, over lunch in the attorney general’s private dining room with Michael Balsamo, a Justice Department beat reporter at the Associated Press. Also in attendance were the DOJ chief of staff, Will Levi, and spokesperson Kerri Kupec. Balsamo was not told the reason for the invitation. When Barr dropped his bombshell between bites of salad, he mumbled, and Balsamo wasn’t sure that he had caught what the attorney general had said.  “Just to be crystal clear,” Balsamo asked, “are you saying—”  “Sir, I think you better repeat what you just said,” Kupec interjected.  “To date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election,” Barr repeated. This time Balsamo heard him.  David A. Graham: Trump’s coup attempt didn’t start on January 6  Balsamo’s story appeared on the AP newswire shortly after lunch ended: “Disputing Donald Trump’s persistent baseless claims, Attorney General William Barr declared Tuesday the U.S. Justice Department had uncovered no evidence of widespread voter fraud that could change the outcome of the 2020 election.”  The story blew a hole in the president’s claims. Nobody seriously questioned Barr’s conservative credentials or whether he had been among Trump’s most loyal Cabinet secretaries. His conclusion sent a definitive message that the effort to overturn the election was without merit.  Barr told me that Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell had been urging him to speak out since mid-November. Publicly, McConnell had said nothing to criticize Trump’s allegations, but he told Barr that Trump’s claims were damaging to the country and to the Republican Party. Trump’s refusal to concede was complicating McConnell’s efforts to ensure that the GOP won the two runoff elections in Georgia scheduled for January 5.  To McConnell, the road to maintaining control of the Senate was simple: Republicans needed to make the argument that with Biden soon to be in the White House, it was crucial that they have a majority in the Senate to check his power. But McConnell also believed that if he openly declared Biden the winner, Trump would be enraged and likely act to sabotage the Republican Senate campaigns in Georgia. Barr related his conversations with McConnell to me. McConnell confirms the account.  “Look, we need the president in Georgia,” McConnell told Barr, “and so we cannot be frontally attacking him right now. But you’re in a better position to inject some reality into this situation. You are really the only one who can do it.”  “I understand that,” Barr said. “And I’m going to do it at the appropriate time.”  On another call, McConnell again pleaded with Barr to come out and shoot down the talk of widespread fraud.  “Bill, I look around, and you are the only person who can do it,” McConnell told him.  Levi, the Justice Department chief of staff, had also been urging Barr to contradict Trump’s assertions. But Barr had said nothing publicly to indicate that he disagreed with the president about the election. In fact, the week after the election, he gave prosecutors the green light to investigate “substantial allegations” of vote irregularities that “could potentially impact the outcome” of the election. The move overturned long-standing policy that the Justice Department does not investigate voter fraud until after an election is certified. The theory behind the policy is that the department’s responsibility is to prosecute crimes, not to get involved in election disputes. Barr’s reversal of the policy was interpreted by some as a sign that he might use the department to help Trump overturn the election.  Donald Ayer: Bill Barr’s unconstitutional campaign to reelect the president  But Barr told me he had already concluded that it was highly unlikely that evidence existed that would tip the scales in the election. He had expected Trump to lose and therefore was not surprised by the outcome. He also knew that at some point, Trump was going to confront him about the allegations, and he wanted to be able to say that he had looked into them and that they were unfounded. So, in addition to giving prosecutors approval to open investigations into clear and credible allegations of substantial fraud, Barr began his own, unofficial inquiry into the major claims that the president and his allies were making.  “My attitude was: It was put-up or shut-up time,” Barr told me. “If there was evidence of fraud, I had no motive to suppress it. But my suspicion all the way along was that there was nothing there. It was all bullshit.”  The Department of Justice ended up conducting no formal investigations of voter fraud, but as part of Barr’s informal review, he asked the U.S. Attorney in Michigan about Trump’s claim that mysterious “ballot dumps” in Detroit had secured Biden’s victory in the state.  As proof of fraud, Trump’s allies had pointed to videos showing boxes filled with ballots arriving at the TCF Center, in Detroit, to be counted after the 8 p.m. deadline for votes to be cast. But Barr quickly found that there was a logical explanation. It had to do with how the 662 precincts in Wayne County, home to Detroit, tabulate their votes. “In every other county, they count the ballots at the precinct, but in Wayne County, they bring them into one central counting place. So the boxes are coming in all night. The fact that boxes are coming in—well, that’s what they do.”  Furthermore, Trump performed better against Biden in Detroit than he had against Hillary Clinton in 2016. Biden received 1,000 fewer votes in Detroit than Clinton had, and Trump received 5,000 more votes than he had four years earlier. Trump didn’t lose Michigan because of “illegal” ballots cast in Detroit. He lost Michigan because Biden beat him badly in the suburbs.  Barr also looked into allegations that voting machines across the country were rigged to switch Trump votes to Biden votes. He received two briefings from cybersecurity experts at the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI. “We realized from the beginning it was just bullshit,” Barr told me, noting that even if the machines somehow changed the count, it would show up when they were recounted by hand. “It’s a counting machine, and they save everything that was counted. So you just reconcile the two. There had been no discrepancy reported anywhere, and I’m still not aware of any discrepancy.”  After the lunch with Balsamo, Barr and Levi went to the White House for a previously scheduled meeting with Chief of Staff Mark Meadows. After talking briefly with Meadows, they went upstairs to White House Counsel Pat Cipollone’s office. As they were conferring, one of the counsel’s aides knocked on the door and told Cipollone that the president wanted to see him and then, pointing to Barr, the aide said, “And he is looking for you.”  Barr, Levi, and Cipollone walked to the president’s personal dining room near the Oval Office. Trump was sitting at the table. Meadows was sitting next to him with his arms crossed; the White House adviser Eric Herschmann stood off to the side. The details of this meeting were described to me by several people present. One told me that Trump had “the eyes and mannerism of a madman.”  He went off on Barr.  “I think you’ve noticed I haven’t been talking to you much,” Trump said to him. “I’ve been leaving you alone.”  Barr later told others that the comment was reminiscent of a line in the movie Dr. Strangelove, in which the main character, Brigadier General Jack D. Ripper, says, “I do not avoid women, Mandrake, but I do deny them my essence.” Trump, Barr thought, was saying that he had been denying him his essence.  Trump brought up Barr’s AP interview.  “Did you say that?”  “Yes,” Barr responded.  “How the fuck could you do this to me? Why did you say it?”  “Because it’s true.”  The president, livid, responded by referring to himself in the third person: “You must hate Trump. You must hate Trump.”  Read: How Trump could attempt a coup  Barr thought that the president was trying to control himself, but he seemed angrier than he had ever seen him. His face was red. Barr’s AP interview was dominating every cable news channel except the one Trump was watching. The television in the room was tuned to the right-wing, pro-Trump network One America News, which was broadcasting a committee hearing of the Michigan legislature. The hearing featured disproven allegations of massive election fraud, including the testimony of a woman named Melissa Carone, who had worked at the counting location in Detroit and told the committee, “Everything that happened at the TCF Center was fraud. Every single thing.” The next day, Carone would testify again, next to Rudy Giuliani, during which time she slurred her words and appeared to be drunk. (Carone later denied that she had been drunk.)  “They saw the boxes going in!” Trump yelled, referring to the stories about boxes of illegal ballots being counted.  “You know, Mr. President, there are 662 precincts in Wayne County,” Barr said. Trump seemed taken aback that he knew the exact number. “It’s the only county with all the boxes going to a central place, and you actually did better there this time around than you did last time. You keep on saying that the Department of Justice is not looking at this stuff, and we are looking at it in a responsible way. But your people keep on shoveling this shit out.”  As Trump ranted about other examples of fraud, Meadows continued to sit silently with his arms crossed, his posture suggesting that he, too, was upset by what Barr had done.  “You know, you only have five weeks, Mr. President, after an election to make legal challenges,” Barr said. “This would have taken a crackerjack team with a really coherent and disciplined strategy. Instead, you have a clown show. No self-respecting lawyer is going anywhere near it. It’s just a joke. That’s why you are where you are.”  Interestingly, Trump didn’t argue when Barr told him that his “clown show” legal team had wasted time. In fact, he said, “You may be right about that.”  After going through his litany of claims—stolen ballots, fake ballots, dead people voting, rigged voting machines—Trump switched to other grievances, shouting at Barr for failing to prosecute Biden’s son Hunter. “If that had been one of my kids, they would have been all over him!” he said. By the end of the meeting, Trump was doing almost all of the talking. Why hadn’t Barr released John Durham’s report on the origins of the Russia investigation before the election? Why hadn’t he prosecuted former FBI Director James Comey? Trump was banging on the table. He said that Barr had been worthless.  As Barr left, he was unsure whether he still had a job. Had Trump just fired him? And if not, shouldn’t he quit? Why remain attorney general after what the president had just said to him? His status had been left up in the air.  The next morning, Barr received a call from Meadows. “I think there’s a way through this,” Meadows told him. He could prevent Trump from firing him, but he wanted an assurance from Barr that he wouldn’t resign. “Are you willing to stay?” Meadows asked.  “I’m not going to sandbag you,” Barr said. “I will give you a warning if I’m going to leave, and No. 2, I’ll stay as long as I’m needed.”  Barr almost immediately began to regret his decision to stay. His statement on election fraud did nothing to deter Trump, who was now listening, almost exclusively, to Giuliani and others outside his administration. They were telling him that he was still going to win the election.  Two weeks later, Barr went down to the White House to tell the president that he planned to resign before the end of the year. It was their first meeting since their confrontation. To defuse the tension, Barr had written an effusive resignation letter, which he handed to the president when he got to the Oval Office. The letter praised Trump’s record and played directly into his complaints about how he had been treated by Democrats, saying his efforts “had been met by a partisan onslaught against you in which no tactic, no matter how abusive and deceitful, was out of bounds.”  Trump read the letter while Barr was sitting across from him. “This is pretty good,” he said.",Inside William Barr’s Breakup With Trump,true

298,60223167635645978316907227702906027630,"A ’super-fat' woman has learned to love her curves, with the help of her husband.  Amalie Jennings, originally from Denmark, moved to Hertfordshire to be with her British husband Sean.  The 25-year-old has spent most of her life hating her body, which resulted in her self-harming, but she now embraces her size 30 frame.  Most people in the couple's lives have been accepting of their 'mixed weight relationship', however they have had to cut contact with Sean's father, although they've not revealed the exact circumstances.  Amalie Jennings, 25, (pictured) used to hate her body, but thanks to her husband Sean (right), she learned to finally love herself. Pictured: The couple at their home in Hertfordshire  Amalie and Sean met online in 2008 and dated long distance for nine years. Amalie could not believe Sean kept talking to her after seeing what she looked like  'I have always been fat since I was two years old. My mum took me to the doctors because I was gaining a lot of weight,' Amalie said.  'Since as long as I can remember I have been fat. And of course that comes with a lot of bullying, a lot of picking on. My oldest memory of bullying is in Kindergarten, I was around four. And all the kids picked on me for being fat.  'I gained even more weight, which meant I was picked on even more. I started self-harming and I got picked on again. I just had a really horrible self-image, I hated looking at the mirror.  'I hated wearing or picking out clothes because nothing would fit me as a child - I had to shop in the woman’s department to get things that would fit.  'I could never wear what my friends wore or what’s in fashion at the time because nothing would fit me.'  Pictured: Sean and Amalie on their wedding day, two years ago. Amalie is now confident about her body  The happy couple posing for pictures in their living-room. Sean (pictured) said he does not have a fetish for fat women, but was attracted to Amalie because he loved her  Amalie first started to recognise that her body shape wasn’t accepted by society when she started reading books.  She said: 'When I was growing up I always loved reading books but there was never people like me. Not even just women, there was never people in them like my size.'  But all of that changed when Amalie met her husband Sean via an online video game in 2008.  She told BTV: 'My husband Sean and I met 11 years ago on a game on the PlayStation. And it was kind of a weird friendship that started, I thought he was an old man just looking for a young woman to talk to but then I learned he is my age.  Amalie pictured as a child. She's struggled with her weight since childhood and used to be badly bullied because of it  'And the thing about online relationships you get to know a person in a different way. Of course we had seen pictures of each other but it took a while for us to cam.  'You could see how fat I was in the pictures but he kept talking to me. I was so insecure about myself, I would hide my double chin.  'But he still didn’t care, he just wanted to talk to me. So we became best friends really fast, and it actually took a while before we realised we were in love with each other. I started giving him hints that I liked him but he didn’t pick up on them.'  Amalie would even post poems on her Facebook profile hinting at her love for Sean – but while he would read them and compliment Amalie on her poems he didn’t realise she was writing about him.  Finally she plucked up the courage to tell Sean the extent of her feelings, only to learn her felt the same way too.  She said: 'It was the weirdest feeling because I haven’t had luck with boyfriends before. And finally there’s this guy, 500 miles away who fancies me as much as I fancy him.  The couple live together in Hertfordshire and want to challenge the stigmas surrounding fatphobia and mixed-weight relationships  Amalie and Sean started dating long distance, visiting each other for nine years, and finally marrying on a beach two years ago.  Sean told BTV: 'I wouldn’t say I am generally attracted to larger women, I am attracted to people that I love really so it just happened.  'I mean, maybe in my head before we met, it wouldn't have been someone as large. But it just happened to be and it is not that I find her any less attractive necessarily.  Amalie added: 'It's never been like a fat fetish thing but you haven't like obsessively said ""Oh, I love your fat stomach"" and stuff like that.  'The thing with weight differences in relationships is there always will be people who comment, ""Why would you be with them? Why would you be with that kind of person?""  Amalie as a child. She said that as she's grown older, she's realised that while she can't stop people judging her and looking at her, she is able to stop caring about their opinions  'Because there is this image that a fat person has to be with a fat person and a thin person has to be with a thin person. I would like more people to come out and be proud of their partner, be proud of themselves.'  Amalie wants to highlight issues that surround fatphobia in the medical field too.  She said: 'There’s a lot of that phobia in the medical field. And that’s what gets me, I don’t feel safe going to the doctors anymore, because you can go in with a broken arm and you will be told you should lose weight.'  'I am happy in my body and I am happy with who I am and what I look like, and I don’t want to fall into the pressure of having to lose weight to be accepted by everyone else.  'If I was ever to go back and speak to a younger Amalie I would say stop wasting time hating yourself. Yes your body is different but it doesn’t mean that it’s a bad body.  'You will never be able to stop people saying things about you. You will never be able to stop them looking at you, but you can stop letting it affect you. You also need to know that you will find people who love you, who love your body for what it is.'",A woman who used to self-harm because of her size 30 frame said her husband loves her body,true
299,225761225397919572119243248130549004890,"Artist and model Ivy Love Getty, the great granddaughter of J. Paul Getty and one of the heiresses to the oil fortune he amassed, married photographer Tobias Alexander Engel in a ceremony officiated by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi at City Hall in San Francisco. The bride first met her groom through a family member, and they eventually ran into each other again at Paris Fashion Week. “I saw this cute guy who was taking photos of the event and of me,” she remembers. “I naturally went over, and we started talking. Quickly we realized that we had met before, the year before.”  While they were dating, the New York-based couple traveled often. On one of their trips abroad, Toby asked Ivy to marry him. “After attending the Unicef Ball, we went to Capri for three days,” Getty says. “Normally, I pick where we go out to eat, but this time Toby insisted he pick. This didn’t raise any red flags, but when I got to the restaurant, I thought to myself ‘Oh he really planned this. We had a table overlooking the entire island away from the rest of the restaurant. The waitress came, and we ordered our food. As the sun was getting ready to set, we went outside to take photos of it. Toby set his iPhone timer and got down on one knee. The timer went off at the perfect moment as we have the most incredible photo.”  Toby proposed with a sapphire engagement ring on a yellow gold band that’s reminiscent of Princess Diana’s ring. Diamonds from a necklace Ivy’s grandmother gave her when she was a teenager were added around the center stone. “It is the most unique piece of jewelry and so sentimental to me,” she says. “I can’t help but smile every time I look down and see it!”  Because of the pandemic, the couple didn’t immediately start planning, instead biding their time a bit. They wanted their friends and family to be able to celebrate with them, especially as Ivy had lost both her grandmother Ann—the notable interior designer and philanthropist who raised her—and her father John Gilbert Getty in 2020. “When my beloved grandmother passed away, I knew I wanted to have the wedding in my house to honor her,” Getty says. “My grandmother interior designed each room of the house which allows me to feel as if she is there with me. I would be able to look around the room and see something that reminds me of her. Her presence is everywhere in that home. The theme of my entire wedding is the house and my grandmother.”  “I was lucky enough to have stayed in the house where Ivy and Tobias celebrated their wedding,” Vogue contributing editor Hamish Bowles (who has also recently been appointed the Editor in Chief of World of Interiors) says. “It’s one of the great treasure houses of America, suffused with Ann’s alchemical touch.”  Art and panels from the house were incorporated into the save-the-dates and invitations. “Growing up in that house and being around great parties my whole life, I never had to turn to Pinterest for inspiration,” Getty says. “I am fortunate that one of my best friends, who I’ve known my entire life, is event planner Stanlee Gatti. I also hired wedding planner Jocelyn Arelt of Arelt Events. I had the list of creatives surrounding me that I always knew would help plan my wedding. The process showed me how much planning and effort goes into a wedding, and I had so much fun doing it!”  The wedding kicked off with a British Invasion Mod Party at The Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco on Thursday night. Stanlee’s inspiration for the first night of festivities was Barberella, the 1968 sci-fi film directed by Jean-Claude Forest. It took Stanlee’s team seven days to reimagine what normally feels like an airline hanger inside into a full-fledged nightclub, complete with shiny silver walls. “I knew the walls were silver the day before, I didn’t know anything else,” Getty admits. “I didn’t tell them anything specific. Everything has been a complete surprise.”  “I don’t do storyboards, proposals, or anything that formal,” Gatti says. “I put clay on the wheel and spin.”  Guests arrived on the scene in short, sexy sequins, gogo boots, and big half up, half down hair—ready to party just as soon as their vaccination cards were checked and their phones were locked and stowed away in pouches. Dancers put on a show in clear plastic bubbles while Mark Ronson DJed. Eventually, Earth Wind & Fire took the stage. Ivy wore three looks during the course of the evening, all styled by Carrie Goldberg of CLG Creative. A vintage Emanuel Ungaro dress with coral and diamond earrings from Stephen Russell, a vintage Emilio Pucci dress and D’Accori shoes, and finally a customized vintage Norman Norell from Happy Isles in L.A.  “It wasn’t hard to get inspired by each event, starting with the mod themed welcome party,” Goldberg explains. “We agreed that nothing should play it safe, and that we should focus on turning up the volume on the ‘60s vibe Ivy’s so inspired by. We referenced iconic photos of Twiggy, Mary Quant, Jean Shrimpton, and more to set the tone.”  The following day, guests joined the couple for a picnic lunch at the Log Cabin on Presidio, overlooking the city—IV drips were at the ready for anyone in need of help recovering from the night before. “Butterflies are sentimental to Ivy, and so we incorporated them wherever possible,” Goldberg says of the bride’s look for this daytime event. “This archive Alexander McQueen gown from Pre-Fall 2016 had her name all over it: A black lace gown with an open back and a mock neck featuring dozens of hand-embroidered butterflies whose wings fluttered as she walked. It was all about dark romance, something soft but with a dose of edge—we paired it with Christian Louboutin platform sandals, Stephen Russell antique earrings, Chloe sunglasses, and a cheeky Romeo and Juliet clutch by Olympia Le Tan.”  That evening, an intimate group gathered for a ceremony rehearsal at city hall, followed by an intimate dinner at Quince restaurant. Ivy collaborated with her dear friend Paul Burgo of Factory New York on a custom look—a sequin midi dress in shades of fuchsia, black, and white, paired with a custom headpiece. “Accessories were kept sleek but undeniably Ivy,” Goldberg says. “Shoulder duster earrings by Material Good, Amina Muaddi pumps, and a crystal-edged, black satin mini bag.”  The wedding day started with a pajama party. “We have the whole mezzanine level,” Getty explains. “There’s a styling room with all of the extra clothes, and there’s two hotel rooms that they removed all of the hotel furniture from and then there are these individual Margiela boxes with all of the bridesmaids’ names engraved on them.”  “Normally, I don’t do bridesmaids dresses because bridal gowns alone take up so much of my time,” Galliano says. “But as I was so bewitched by Ivy and her stories of these women she had grown up with—her bridesmaids—made an exception. Before I knew it, the bridesmaids numbers reached fourteen! And these girls are the Gen Z babies. I dressed their mothers and their aunties! Creating the bridesmaids’ dresses wasn’t easy with the current travel situation, but bravo to Ivy, Alexis [Roche], and Auntie Vanessa for coordinating everything. You can’t imagine getting these girls all together at Claridge’s at 4:00 a.m. in the morning, walking around in peignoirs for 48 hours to do their fittings. They were so lovely and such fun. Some of the dresses have taken on a more bias-cut influence, and some have taken on a double-layering technique played out in pale, thunderous grays and lilacs, with lamés woven to echo those colors.”  Ivy got ready with cousin Vanessa Waibel and actress Anya Taylor-Joy in the penthouse suite at the Fairmont Hotel. She wore her John Galliano for Maison Margiela Haute Couture down the aisle, paired with a couture veil and headdress. Christian Louboutin shoes, designed in collaboration with John Galliano, completed Ivy’s look along with pieces borrowed from her grandmother’s jewelry collection.  “John has been talking about the dress for months,” Bowles says. “And he’s understandably obsessed with Ivy who is not only beautiful but the acme of cool and charm.""  Stanlee and his team carpeted the entire rotunda of City Hall with bright teal and pink Persian rugs, completely transforming the space. “We draped all the archways on the second floor and first floor with turquoise and rose pink velvet drapes with 12” long gold thread fringe,” he explains. “We hung in waterfall fashion off the grand staircase railings, from top to bottom, thousands of pale pink dendrobiam orchids. Large stone urns on pedestals filled with pastel roses were through the rotunda and a top the staircase. I wanted to channel Ann,” Gatti says. “The colors, patterns and fabrics were a nod to Ann.”  The bridesmaids filed in first, wearing their Maison Martin Margiela Haute Couture by John Galliano dresses. Groomsmen were followed by the flower girls in their butterfly wings. “The whole wedding party looked amazing with the bridesmaids dressed like Vestals in cloudy grey gauze and bias satin, and the flower girls with butterfly wings,” Bowles says. “Ivy looked incredible in all those mirror shards that tinkled as she walked up the steps and the wedding veil embroidered with all those symbols that had so much resonance for her and represented the beloved people in her life. John was involved in every aspect of how the party would look, establishing the hair styles and so on, and the result was incredibly beautiful and poetic.”  Guests were asked to mask up before Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi entered the room and took her position at the microphone. The groom proceeded to recite vows he’d written himself: “Faith in us has changed my world, captured my heart and tamed my soul. Your belief in me and in us has been the biggest gift of my life,” he said. “I treasure it every day. My love for you is an intrinsic part of me. This day symbolizes a new beginning of our journey together. I think of you, happy to know I am yours and you are mine.”  Music composed by Gordon Getty was performed, then best man Frederic Trohler and Ivy’s rescue Chihuahua mix, Blue, supplied the rings at the request of Speaker Pelosi. The couple was pronounced husband and wife. They embraced to kiss, and somewhere amid all of the excitement Ivy’s crown toppled off. Within seconds, Raffaele Ilardo on Galliano's team was up on stage to recreate her look. Queue Myra, the singer known for her hit in The Princess Diaries—she started playing “Miracles Happen” from the balcony, and the bridal party, led by actress Anya Taylor-Joy, broke into dance. It was a surreal moment that could well have taken place in Genovia.  “San Francisco’s City Hall is designed to inspire awe—a symbol of the city’s power and resilience after the devastating 1906 earthquake and fire, with its white marble detailing and soaring dome that looms more than 300 feet overhead,” Hamish notes. “But despite the architectural magnificence—and the panoply of state, with Nancy Pelosi officiating and Governor Newsom and Mayor Breed in attendance—the ceremony managed to feel extraordinarily intimate and personal, with Tobias’s charming vows and his passionate kiss that dislodged Ivy’s crown!”  Guests then piled into black cars and shuttles headed for the Getty Mansion. A Latin band and the Pena Pachamama dancers took over one room, there were bars and buffets tucked away throughout, and a rose garden was erected for DJ Dojah's dance party. The bride wore a second couture look by Maison Margiela with a draped aquamarine choker that worked perfectly with the raw edge neckline of the gown for the reception. “Ivy’s reception dress was exquisite,” Bowles notes. “Like a tattered Madame Vionnet gown in wisps of delicately embroidered pale pink chiffon and tulle, it was like a breath and moved so beautifully for the first dance.” As guests mingled from room to room sampling various buffets, there were moments—like when the couple cut the cake, toasted their guests, expressing how grateful they are and remembering those loved ones who are no longer with us—that felt like a typical family wedding at home, complete with eccentric cousins and all. But then one remembered the setting and its significance: Ann and Gordon Getty amassed a museum-quality collection of European antiques, Venetian paintings, French textiles, and Russian chandeliers over the years. Rooms are covered in gold-framed Impressionist paintings by artists like Matisse, Degas, and Cassatte, to name a few, and decorative pillows made from Lyon silks and embroidered Chinese brocades are strewn across deep sofas. So while Bon Jovi’s wedding ballad “Living on a Prayer” was played, at this wedding, the bride was jumping up and down with John Galliano on the dance floor while guests chanted “Woah, we’re halfway there!” It felt opulent and fun, elegant but also wild. “It was exciting to see the collision of rather grand San Francisco society and all the couple’s contemporaries—beautiful, free spirited rebels being their authentic selves in that amazingly operatic setting,” Bowles says. “They were all astoundingly charming and engaged and engaging. It gave one hope for the future! The party ended at around 1:00 in the morning, but as the ceremony had been so much earlier it seemed far later. The intrepid headed off to the penthouse at the Fairmont.”  “It’s just like everything I could have dreamed of and more,” Getty says. “So it’s wild when something so magical comes true because you’ve thought about it but didn’t actually think it would.” Miracles happen.",Inside Ivy Getty’s Fantasy Wedding Weekend in San Francisco,true
300,49117880361224822974898234009662197320,"Volcano Watch is a weekly article and activity update written by U.S. Geological Survey Hawaiian Volcano Observatory scientists and affiliates.  Sources/Usage: Public Domain. La Palma is a basaltic shield volcano in the Canary Islands. Like Hawaiian volcanoes, La Palma typically erupts lava flows. This aerial photo, courtesy of Radio Televisión Canaria, shows lava flows that are being generated by a fissure eruption upslope on La Palma. One of the lava flows is entering the ocean, creating new land called a lava delta. Lava deltas are built by the accumulation of lava near the base of the sea cliff at an ocean entry.  “Volcano Watchers” are probably aware that an eruption began on La Palma in the Canary Islands on September 19. The eruption style is similar to Hawaiian eruptions, and both locations share the potential for flank collapse and tsunami.  Basaltic ocean islands, such as the Island of Hawai‘i and the Canary Islands, tend to experience catastrophic landslides every few hundred thousand years—a discovery first made by USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory Scientist-in-Charge Jim Moore in the early 1960s! A significant portion of an island is removed during collapse and has the potential to displace tremendous amounts of seawater, generating local tsunami waves that are thought to be over 100 meters (300 feet) high. From this understanding grew a notion that collapsing volcanoes—particularly in the Canary Islands—could generate ocean-wide “mega-tsunami.”  In 2001, an academic paper suggested that collapse of La Palma could result in tsunami waves up to 25 m (about 80 feet) high along the east coasts of North and South America. This scenario made headlines in the media, which inaccurately depicted a huge wave devastating New York City.  But can collapses actually generate these “mega-tsunami” far from their sources? Subsequent research casts doubt on this idea.  The Canary Islands “mega-tsunami” scenario assumed a single, coherent, massive collapse block that reached a high velocity very quickly. Ocean floor mapping surrounding the Canary Islands, however, indicates that collapses instead occur in incremental or piecemeal fashion. In addition, geomorphologists found, via slope stability analysis, that the potential collapse volume is much smaller than was simulated by the 2001 paper.  Tsunami modeling has also advanced considerably since 2001. Studies of landslide-induced waves show that they travel at different speeds and interact more across long distances, leading to smaller wave height far from their sources. Better knowledge of ocean bathymetry, island and coastal topography, and the transfer of energy between slide blocks and water also contributed to more accurate modeling.  These new simulations suggest that the maximum wave height along the east coast of the Americas from a “worst-case scenario” collapse of La Palma would be on the order of 1-2 m (3-7 feet)—still hazardous, but similar to common storm surge.  A lack of geologic evidence also calls the “mega-tsunami” hypothesis into question. Tsunami leave characteristic sediment deposits on the coastlines they impact. But no such deposit has ever been identified on the east coasts of North and South America.  Collapses of Canary Island volcanoes are rare, occurring on timescales of hundreds of thousands of years, and should be preceded by signs of flank instability: increases in earthquakes and ground surface deformation. Canary Island volcanoes also erupt regularly—La Palma last erupted in 1971 and 1949—and slope stability analyses conducted at La Palma indicate that the structure is stable. The volcano would have to grow significantly before a collapse was likely.  This abundant evidence refutes the “mega-tsunami” hypothesis, demonstrating that it does not hold up to rigorous examination. However, tsunami that are generated by volcanoes are a real process and a significant threat. For example, the 1883 explosive eruption of Krakatau, in Indonesia, caused a local tsunami that killed tens of thousands on nearby coastlines. In 2018, a smaller eruption and collapse of Anak Krakatau, an island which grew in the 1883 caldera, also resulted in a local tsunami that killed hundreds.  Local tsunami can also be generated by other volcanic processes. On the Island of Hawai‘i, lava delta collapse at lava-ocean entries can cause small tsunami that impact areas adjacent to the delta. Slip on the fault underlying Kīlauea’s south flank, associated with M7–8 earthquakes, caused local tsunami in 1868 and 1975 that took lives. These are processes that have happened repeatedly in human history; they will happen again, and their associated hazards deserve our attention.  While the scientific view of the “mega-tsunami” hypothesis has evolved in the years since 2001, that original work led others to start investigations that contributed new knowledge that advanced our understanding of landslides and tsunami generated by volcanoes. In this way, the story is a marvelous example of exactly how science happens!  Volcano Activity Updates  Kīlauea volcano is erupting. Its USGS Volcano Alert level is at WATCH (https://www.usgs.gov/natural-hazards/volcano-hazards/about-alert-levels). Kīlauea updates are issued daily.  Lava continues to erupt from a single vent in the western wall of Halemaʻumaʻu crater. All lava activity is confined within Halemaʻumaʻu crater in Hawai‘i Volcanoes National Park. Sulfur dioxide emission rates remain high and were estimated at around 2,700 tonnes per day on Oct. 17, 2021. Seismicity is elevated but stable, with few earthquakes and ongoing volcanic tremor. Summit tiltmeters have remained relatively flat over the past week. For more information on the current eruption of Kīlauea, see Recent Eruption (usgs.gov).  Mauna Loa is not erupting and remains at Volcano Alert Level ADVISORY. This alert level does not mean that an eruption is imminent or that progression to an eruption from the current level of unrest is certain. Mauna Loa updates are issued weekly.  This past week, about 114 small-magnitude earthquakes were recorded below the summit and upper elevation flanks of Mauna Loa—the majority of these occurred at shallow depths less than 10 kilometers (6 miles). Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements show no major deformation over the past week. Gas concentrations and fumarole temperatures at both the summit and at Sulphur Cone on the Southwest Rift Zone remain stable. Webcams show no changes to the landscape. For more information on current monitoring of Mauna Loa, see: https://www.usgs.gov/volcanoes/mauna-loa/monitoring.  There were 9 events with 3 or more felt reports in the Hawaiian Islands during the past week.

He was 84. (AP Photo/Marcy Nighswander, File)  WASHINGTON (AP) — Colin Powell, the trailblazing soldier and diplomat whose sterling reputation of service to Republican and Democratic presidents was stained by his faulty claims to justify the 2003 U.S. war in Iraq, died Monday of COVID-19 complications. He was 84.  A veteran of the Vietnam War, Powell spent 35 years in the Army and rose to the rank of four-star general before becoming the first Black chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. His oversight of the U.S. invasion of Kuwait to oust the Iraqi army in 1991 made him a household name, prompting speculation for nearly a decade that he might run for president, a course he ultimately decided against.  He instead joined President George W. Bush’s administration in 2001 as secretary of state, the first Black person to represent the U.S. government on the world stage. Powell’s tenure, however, was marred by his 2003 address to the United Nations Security Council in which he cited faulty information to claim that Saddam Hussein had secretly stashed weapons of mass destruction. Such weapons never materialized, and though the Iraqi leader was removed, the war devolved into years of military and humanitarian losses.  Powell was fully vaccinated against the coronavirus, his family said. But he faced several ailments, telling Washington Post journalist Bob Woodward over the summer that he had Parkinson’s disease. Powell’s longtime aide, Peggy Cifrino, said Monday that he was also treated over the past few years for multiple myeloma, a blood cancer that impairs the body’s ability to fight infection. Studies have shown that those cancer patients don’t get as much protection from the COVID-19 vaccines as healthier people.  In a Washington where partisan divisions run deep, Democrats and Republicans recalled Powell fondly. Flags were ordered lowered at government buildings, including the White House, Pentagon and State Department.  President Joe Biden said Powell “embodied the highest ideals of both warrior and diplomat.”  Noting Powell’s rise from a childhood in a fraying New York City neighborhood, Biden said: “He believed in the promise of America because he lived it. And he devoted much of his life to making that promise a reality for so many others.”  Powell’s time as secretary of state was largely defined by the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. He was the first American official to publicly blame Osama bin Laden’s al-Qaida network. He made a lightning trip to Pakistan to demand that then-Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf cooperate with the United States in going after the Afghanistan-based group, which also had a presence in Pakistan, where bin Laden was later killed.  But as the push for war in Iraq deepened, Powell sometimes found himself at odds with other key figures in the Bush administration, including Vice President Dick Cheney and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. Rumsfeld also died this year.  Powell’s State Department was dubious of the military and intelligence communities’ conviction that Saddam possessed or was developing weapons of mass destruction. But he presented the administration’s case that Saddam posed a major regional and global threat in a strong speech to the U.N. Security Council in February 2003. The following month, Bush gave the go-ahead for the invasion.  The U.N. speech, complete with Powell’s display of a vial of what he said could have been a biological weapon, was seen as a low point in his career, although he had removed some elements from the remarks that he deemed to have been based on poor intelligence assessments.  The U.S. overthrow of Saddam ended the rule of a brutal dictator. But the power vacuum and lawlessness that followed unleashed years of sectarian fighting and chaos that killed countless Iraqi civilians, sparked a lengthy insurgency, and unintentionally tilted the balance of power in the Middle East toward a U.S. rival, Iran. No Iraqi weapons of mass destruction were ever found.  Still, Powell maintained in a 2012 interview with The Associated Press that on balance, the U.S. succeeded in Iraq.  “I think we had a lot of successes,” he said. “Iraq’s terrible dictator is gone.”  Saddam was captured by U.S. forces while hiding out in northern Iraq in December 2003 and was later executed by the Iraqi government. But the war dragged on. President Barack Obama pulled U.S. troops out of Iraq in 2011, but he sent advisers back in 2014 after the Islamic State group swept into the country from Syria and captured large swaths of territory.  Bush said Monday that he and former first lady Laura Bush were “deeply saddened” by Powell’s death.  “He was a great public servant” and “widely respected at home and abroad,” Bush said. “And most important, Colin was a family man and a friend. Laura and I send Alma and their children our sincere condolences as they remember the life of a great man.”  Condoleezza Rice, Powell’s successor at State and the department’s first Black female secretary, praised him as “a trusted colleague and a dear friend through some very challenging times.”  Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, a retired Army general and the first Black Pentagon chief, said the news of Powell’s death left “a hole in my heart.”  “The world lost one of the greatest leaders that we have ever witnessed,” Austin said while traveling in Europe.  Vice President Kamala Harris, the highest ranking Black woman in U.S. history, also noted Powell’s racial firsts.  “Every step of the way, when he filled those roles, he was by everything that he did and the way he did it, inspiring so many people,” she said. “Young servicemembers and others not only within the military, but in our nation and around the globe, took notice of what his accomplishments meant as a reflection of who we are as a nation.”  No child of privilege, Powell often framed his biography as an American success story.  “Mine is the story of a black kid of no early promise from an immigrant family of limited means who was raised in the South Bronx,” he wrote in his 1995 autobiography “My American Journey.”  It’s an experience he was fond of recalling later in his life. When he appeared at the United Nations, even during his Iraq speech, he often reminisced about his childhood in New York City, where he grew up the child of Jamaican immigrants and got one of his first jobs at the Pepsi-Cola bottling plant directly across the East River from the U.N. headquarters.  Powell’s path toward the military began at City College, where discovered the ROTC. When he put on his first uniform, he wrote, “I liked what I saw.”  He joined the Army and in 1962 he was one of more than 16,000 military advisers sent to South Vietnam by President John F. Kennedy. A series of promotions led to the Pentagon and assignment as a military assistant to Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, who became his unofficial sponsor. He later became commander of the Army’s 5th Corps in Germany and later was national security assistant to President Ronald Reagan.  During his term as Joint Chiefs chairman, his approach to war became known as the Powell Doctrine, which held that the United States should only commit forces in a conflict if it has clear and achievable objectives with public support, sufficient firepower and a strategy for ending the war.  Though he gained national prominence under Republican presidents, Powell ultimately moved away from the party.  He endorsed Democrats in the past four presidential elections, starting with Obama. He emerged as a vocal Donald Trump critic in recent years, describing Trump as “a national disgrace” who should have been removed from office through impeachment.  ___  Associated Press writer Steve Peoples and AP Medical Writer Lauran Neergaard contributed to this report.","Colin Powell dies, trailblazing general stained by Iraq",true
302,81456522420741344114984320164338358739,"(Reuters) - The mayors of New York City and Chicago said on Tuesday they would take President Donald Trump to court if he sent unidentified U.S. government agents to police their cities, pushing back on a threat that has sparked widespread controversy over the use of federal force.  But Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot also said she would accept an influx of FBI agents and other identified law enforcement officials from the Trump administration, an acknowledgement of the scale of gun violence and other crimes plaguing her city.  Lightfoot and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio spoke a day after Trump said he would send law enforcement to several cities including Baltimore, Chicago, New York and Philadelphia to crack down on protests against racism and police brutality ignited by George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis police custody on May 25.  A Republican, Trump made a point of saying the mayors of the cities on his list were liberal Democrats, underpinning concerns the threat was politically motivated. Federal agents last week were dispatched to counter protests in Portland, Oregon, where protesters have complained of agents making arrests without identifying themselves and using unmarked rental cars.  Opinion polls show Trump trails Democratic challenger Joe Biden in the run-up to a Nov. 3 presidential election. Trump has sought to make a crackdown a campaign issue, taking the spotlight off his response to the coronavirus pandemic, a weak point for him in the polls.  De Blasio said Trump’s threat was likely bluster, but added that he would challenge any deployment in the courts. He said the actions of unidentified officers grabbing citizens in Portland “appeared to violate basic constitutional rights.”  “This president blusters and bluffs and says he’s going to do things and they never materialize on a regular basis, so we should not overrate his statements, they are so often not true.”  Lightfoot said on Tuesday that she had been told that no unidentified officers would be deployed. The Chicago Tribune had reported on Monday that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which oversees the forces in Portland, would deploy 150 agents to help tamp down violence in the city.  “Unfortunately there’s been a lot of saber rattling about that coming from the president and members of his team,” Lightfoot told reporters. “What I understand at this point, and I caveat that, is that the Trump administration is not going to actually deploy unnamed agents in the streets of Chicago.”  FILE PHOTO: New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio speaks to people as he gives away face masks for using on public spaces to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the Queens borough of New York City, U.S., May 16, 2020 REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz/File Photo  Instead, Lightfoot said reinforcements would come from the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and “plug into” federal agencies already coordinating with the city on crime.  50 NIGHTS OF PROTEST  The Portland protests have gone on for more than 50 nights. On Monday, video showed federal agents firing tear gas, protesters pulling down fencing around the federal courthouse, and hundreds of people dressed in yellow who said they were mothers and fathers demanding the agents withdraw.  DHS has placed about 2,000 officials from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and other agencies on standby for possible deployment to cities, the New York Times reported.  A CBP official told Reuters that officers from three border units in paramilitary-type operations had been deployed to Portland. It was unclear whether officers had been deployed to other cities.  White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany told a briefing on Tuesday that dispatching agents was justified by a federal statute empowering the secretary of Homeland Security to deputize agents to protect federal property and people on that property.  At a separate briefing, acting Homeland Security secretary Chad Wolf said his agents were properly identifying themselves in Portland. “We are only targeting and arresting those who have been identified as committing crime,” Wolf said.  However, legal experts said there were limits to Trump’s power and that he could be challenged in court. “The president is not the king,” said Kent Greenfield, a Boston College law professor.  Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum sued the Department of Homeland Security last week and asked a federal judge to grant a temporary order blocking its officers from what she called unlawful detentions that lacked probable cause.  Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner said he would criminally charge any federal agents who arrested citizens without probable cause or restrained them unlawfully. He said he saw potential crimes by agents in video footage from Portland.  But Krasner said he was skeptical that Trump would actually send agents to Philadelphia. He said the city’s protests had been peaceful. “Let us not take these fluffy words and act like they are more than they really are,” he said. “It’s really just bluster.”","New York, Chicago promise court fight if Trump sends in unidentified federal agents",true

Other states have passed similar laws, but those measures face legal challenges. The Texas law is the first to be implemented. On a vote of 5 to 4, the court refused just before midnight on Wednesday to block the law.  Because of the way the law was written, it may be difficult to challenge in court, representing a sea change in the battle over abortion rights and inviting imitation by other jurisdictions seeking to tamp down access to abortion.  “These laws are unconstitutional, as we have understood Supreme Court rulings until now, and courts have quickly issued preliminary injunctions blocking enforcement,” said Elizabeth Nash, state policy analyst for the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights.",Answers to Questions About the Texas Abortion Law,true

306,108862640924070894267862666722544232601,"Pilot Nicholas Synnott spoke to ABC 30 after being leaving a Texas hospital in December 2020. (ABC 30)  A British Airways pilot who spent a record 243 days in a hospital in Texas while suffering from Covid-19 before returning home, has died in a hospital in the UK.  Nicholas Synnott, 60, was a father of two who was infected with the virus more than a year ago while flying between London and Houston. He died last week, MailOnline reported.  Mr Synnott was admitted to a hospital in Houston in March 2020. The cause of his death remains unclear, but it’s probable that his death was related to the aftermath of surviving Covid-19 as doctors have said that his organs suffered severe damage as a result of the virus.  Houston Doctor Bindu Akkanti said it was remarkable that Mr Synnott managed to get out of the American hospital as he was comatose and went through several organ failures.  Mr Synnott is survived by his wife Nicola, 54, a school administrator, and his two children, charity worker Rebecca, 24, and George, 21, who is in training to also be a pilot, MailOnline reported.  Captain Al Bridger, director of flight operations at British Airways, said: “We are devastated by this incredibly sad news. Nick was a valued member of our pilot family and a friend to many at the airline. Our thoughts are with his family and friends at this extremely difficult time.”  The family of Mr Synnott have asked those who want to support the family to donate to the charity where his daughter works, The Children’s Trust. The charity supports children with brain injuries.  “Nick was a much-loved husband, father, brother, uncle and friend. He will be dearly missed by all that knew him,” a fundraising page said.  “In lieu of flowers, please make a donation on Nick’s behalf to The Children's Trust, where Rebecca (Nick's daughter) works,” the message continued.  During his illness, Mr Synnott was on a ventilator after suffering respiratory failure. He was later treated using a heart and lung machine, according to doctors.  After leaving the hospital in Houston, Mr Synnott told ABC 30: “My temperature was spiking over 100 degrees... then I went through sort of a dark phase where psychologically there were issues I had to come to terms with.”  Story continues  “Every organ of his body was affected by Covid-19,” Dr Biswajit Kar told ABC 30. “But yet, because his health was so good as a pilot prior to the illness, he could sustain all this and survive something as serious as this. We were firstly overwhelmed by the joy that someone this sick could make it.”  When asked how Mr Synnott managed to survive, Dr Akkanti credited his wife, who was at his bedside every day for almost eight months.  “There was always a question, ‘Is he even in there?’ Given the enormous number of... medications [and] the other multi-organ issues that were happening. I think all of us on our team agreed that it was his wife,” Dr Akkanti said.  Mr Synnott told ABC 30 in December 2020 that he managed to get through the eight-month hospital stay “with the support of my wife, and the thought of going back to my kids. It was a tough journey but, we’ve got where we are”.

307,115477152052079584436021116195304879516,"(CNN) The White House's nominee for a top Pentagon post repeatedly spread conspiracy theories that a former CIA director tried to overthrow President Donald Trump and even have him assassinated in newly discovered comments from radio and television appearances as well as on social media.  Retired Army Brig. Gen. Anthony Tata, who was nominated to become the under secretary of defense for policy at the Department of Defense, promoted conspiracy theories that John Brennan, the former CIA director, wanted to oust Trump from office, and pushed a bogus conspiracy theory that Brennan sent a coded tweet to order the assassination of Trump in 2018.  A spokesperson for Brennan declined to comment.  CNN's KFile reviewed dozens of Tata's radio and television appearances and found that he also spread conspiracy theories that a ""deep state cabal"" of officials would rather see Trump fail than succeed in office, a sentiment echoed by the President and his allies, using extreme rhetoric. Tata also said then-President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama engaged in ""borderline treasonous"" behavior by expressing their dismay over a Trump presidency during the transition period.  The retired general's nomination to the third-highest position at the Pentagon faces jeopardy after Democratic senators spoke out against his nomination following CNN's KFile reporting last week on Tata's history of Islamophobia and derogatory comments and tweets, including falsely calling Obama a Muslim and ""terrorist leader."" At least two high-profile retired generals have pulled their support for Tata since his tweets were reported. Tata has since deleted dozens of his tweets, screenshots of which were captured by CNN.  CNN obtained a letter Tata sent to the top members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Republican Chairman Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma and Democrat Jack Reed of Rhode Island, both of whom oversee his nomination, apologizing for his past Islamophobic tweets. He wrote, ""I deeply regret comments I made on social media several years ago"" and that ""my tweets were completely out of character.""  ""My regret, however, has nothing to do with my nomination for Undersecretary of Defense of Policy. Rather, I have a lifetime of public service leadership and a cadre of soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and civilian mentors and protégés whom I disappointed with those comments,"" Tata added in his letter, first reported on Saturday by The Hill  If confirmed by the Senate, Tata would oversee the Pentagon's policy on everything from Afghanistan, China, Iran and Russia to nuclear deterrence and missile defense policy. He would also closely advise the secretary of defense on national security and support the Pentagon's program and budget decisions.  Tata's nomination comes as the White House seeks to install loyalists to key positions throughout the administration. His newly surfaced comments appear to mimic what the President and his allies have long maintained -- that the ""deep state"" has sought to undermine Trump's presidency and that his opponents would rather see the country fail than see him succeed -- without citing specific evidence.  The retired general also said that Obama's foreign policy ""was born of the Jeremiah Wright school of hate America"" and that the former president held a ""Weather Underground"" philosophy, referring respectively to the Obamas' former pastor and to the FBI-designated domestic terrorist group born out of anti-war sentiments that bombed dozens of buildings and government institutions in the 1960s and 1970s.  The Pentagon referred CNN to the White House for comment. The White House stood by Tata and referred CNN to a previous statement defending the nominee from last week  ""Anthony Tata, the President's exceptionally qualified nominee for Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, is a distinguished public servant whose career has provided him with planning, policy, and operational experience both at home and abroad,"" White House spokesman Judd Deere told CNN in an email. ""His education, background, and record has earned him bi-partisan praise, and this attempt by the media to slander his reputation is disgusting. The White House stands by the President's qualified nominee.""  Tata did not respond for comment but, a source familiar with the discussions regarding Tata's nomination told CNN that Tata is ""pleased with the support he's receiving from the White House and DOD teams and hopes to speak members of both parties as soon as possible.""  ""He intends to convey in person or by phone his sincere regret for his past comments and hopes to discuss the serious policy concerns the US faces today,"" the source said.  A US defense official confirmed that Tata still works as a senior adviser in the Pentagon.  Tata spread conspiracy theories that officials were trying to overthrow and assassinate Trump  Tata asserted a number of conspiracy theories in his radio and television appearances and on social media. In several media appearances, Tata attacked Brennan, the former director of the CIA in the Obama administration, as a ""former communist"" who ""manipulated ISIS intelligence"" for Obama on a 2016 podcast  After Trump revoked Brennan's security clearance in August 2018, Tata told Fox News , ""I think that John Brennan is a clear and present danger and a threat to this nation. He supports the overthrow of this particular president and he needed to have his access to information revoked.""  ""It would not surprise me if eventually it came out that he was somehow allied with some foreign power because what he's doing is fomenting the division. You look at his tweets, you look at what he says, and he is doing Putin's bidding every day on Twitter. He is dividing this nation and he's trying to ossify the left against the right,"" said Tata.  Tata went further in a May 2018 tweet when he pushed a conspiracy theory of his own by claiming that Brennan used a coded tweet to order the assassination of Trump. After Brennan tweeted a Cicero quote, Tata replied, ""As incompetent as @JohnBrennan was as a #CIA analyst (failure at Khobar Towers), we must assume he knows spy tradecraft. This is a signal to someone, somewhere. Cicero was assassinated for political reasons. This is a clear threat against @POTUS.""  When a Twitter user challenged if Tata was serious about his accusation, Tata replied , ""Totally. He's nervous. He ran the CIA. He's committed multiple crimes. He has the network to do what he threatens here.""  The Twitter user then asked the retired general if Brennan's tweet was a signal to someone to assassinate the President. Tata wrote back , ""I believe so. Why else would he randomly quote Cicero on a day that @realDonaldTrump asks for an investigation of crimes that directly implicates him? Serious crimes: treason, sedition. He's a cowardly bureaucrat that lucked into a powerful psn. He doesn't have the spine for this.""  In a now deleted tweet, Tata also used the hashtag ""Clinton Body Count"" to refer to the conspiracy that former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have ordered the assassinations of their associates, and wrote that he hoped former FBI lawyer Lisa Page did not meet an ""untimely demise.""  Tata also accused the Obamas of engaging in ""borderline treasonous"" behavior during the presidential transition period from Obama to Trump after they expressed dismay at a Trump presidency.  ""So when you see President Obama on Comedy Central, digging on the President-elect, making fun of him and talking about Russia. And you hear Michelle Obama on the Oprah show saying for the first time in her life, she's felt no hope--that is unconscionable. That is, that is a borderline treasonous to be undermining the term, a peaceful transition of power,"" said Tata on a December 2016 podcast  He also claimed Obama was an insurgent who tried to undermine and overthrow American life in another broadcast from December 2016.  ""He had the Jeremiah Wright philosophy. He had the Weather Underground philosophy. And so he had all the insurgent philosophy of how to undermine American values and American way of life and American foreign policy, which he is effectively done,"" Tata said, referring to the Weather Underground Organization, a radical militant group responsible for bombings and other acts of political violence in the 1960s and 1970s. The FBI designated the organization as a domestic terrorist organization.  Tata also maintained that opponents of Trump would rather see the President fail than succeed, often using extreme rhetoric. In 2018 Tata said , ""I believe in my soul that Hillary Clinton and others would prefer to see a nuclear cloud over America than to see Donald Trump succeed. I mean that 100%.""  ""That we are so divided right now that the left wants to, would rather see the country burned down, than to have this President succeed,"" he added.",Top Pentagon nominee pushed conspiracy theories that former CIA director tried to overthrow Trump and even have him assassinated,true
308,90396961368290957609462884369729058138,"(CNN) Yet another ballot audit is set to move ahead in Georgia's most populous county after a judge ruled Friday that absentee ballots could be unsealed for parties looking to examine them for evidence of fraud.  The review of Fulton County's absentee ballots, which is not set to begin until the judge reviews the terms of the audit, comes as conservatives have clamored for election audits in a number of states in the wake of former President Donald Trump's November loss. The baseless belief that there was widespread fraud has persisted among some Republicans, despite the lack of evidence.  While the Fulton County case paves the way for yet another ballot audit, it will not lead to Georgia's election results -- which have already been certified for President Joe Biden -- being overturned.  The decision in Georgia comes after a handful of plaintiffs filed a lawsuit to access the ballots. But the audit in Fulton County is likely to come with more stipulations than the opaquely operated, GOP-run audit playing out in Arizona's Maricopa County.  While Henry County Judge Brian Amero ordered that the ballots be unsealed, ""Petitioners shall only be permitted to inspect and scan said ballots in accordance with protocols and practices that will be set forth by further order of the Court,"" according to court documents . The judge directed counsel for the parties to convene where the ballots are being stored next week.  Garland Favorito, one of the plaintiffs who brought the lawsuit and the co-founder of Voters Organized for Trusted Election Results in Georgia, said he and his counterparts are formulating a plan to scan and forensically analyze the Fulton County mail-in ballots. He said they will submit that plan to the judge before May 28.  Favorito told CNN that he hopes roughly half a dozen experts will have a chance to evaluate the newly scanned ballot images and search for characteristics that could determine whether any ballots are counterfeit.  ""The reason that we want to do it is to determine whether or not there are counterfeit ballots,"" Favorito said.  Fulton County Chairman Robb Pitts, a Democrat, slammed the push for yet another review of the 2020 election.  ""It is outrageous that Fulton County continues to be a target of those who cannot accept the results from last year's election,"" Pitts said. ""The votes have been counted three times, including a hand recount, and no evidence of fraud has been found. The fact remains that Fulton County safely and securely carried out an election in the midst of a public health pandemic. It's a shame to see that the 'Big Lie' lives on and could cost the hardworking taxpayers of this county.""  He dismissed concerns about counterfeit ballots as little more than a conservative pipe dream.  ""This conspiracy theory about counterfeit ballots has been trotted out by proponents of the 'Big Lie' across the country and shot down every time,"" Pitts said. ""Whether it's looking for bamboo in Arizona's ballots or searching for counterfeits in Fulton's, it is nonsense.""  Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican who has come under fire from many members of his own party after standing up to Trump's attempts to overturn the election, offered a more sanguine response to the judge's ruling.  ""From day one I have encouraged Georgians with legitimate concerns about the election in their counties to pursue those claims through legal avenues,"" Raffensperger said in a statement. ""Fulton County has a longstanding history of election mismanagement that has understandably weakened voters' faith in its system. Allowing this audit provides another layer of transparency and citizen engagement.""  The Georgia Secretary of State's office also noted that Georgia counties have already undergone hand audits and re-scanned each ballot after the Trump campaign requested a recount. Those reviews upheld the original election result showing Biden won the state -- the first Democrat to do so since 1992.  Other conservatives, including former Sen. Kelly Loeffler, cheered the judge's decision.  ""Voter confidence in our election system is the bedrock of our republic,"" she said in a statement. ""Unfortunately, inconsistencies in Fulton County's November 2020 absentee ballots cast serious doubt on voters' faith in our elections.""  But the audit will not change the results of the election.  ""It's not an election challenge and therefore this case alone could not do that,"" Favorito said. ""What this case is about is the equal protection and due process, constitutional rights, of the plaintiffs and all Georgia voters. Because if counterfeit ballots were introduced into the certified results, it diluted our votes and the votes of all Georgians both within and outside of Fulton County.""  CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated the number of experts Garland Favorito wants to examine images of mail-in ballots from Fulton County, Georgia. He said he wanted about half a dozen experts to evaluate the images.","Another ballot audit set to move ahead in Fulton County, Georgia, as judge rules absentee ballots can be unsealed",true
309,289194274798441297411826638961270551018,"A replicating RNA vaccine, formulated with a lipid-based nanoparticle emulsion that goes by the acronym LION, produces antibodies against the COVID-19 coronavirus in mice and primates with a single immunization. These antibodies potently neutralize the virus.  The effects occurred within two weeks after administration through injection into a muscle. The level of antibodies generated was comparable to those in people who are recovering from COVID-19.  The vaccine induced coronavirus-neutralizing antibodies robustly in both younger and older mice. This hopeful finding was well-received by the researchers, because of the concern that the elderly are less likely to respond to vaccination due to their aging immune systems.  Vulnerability to severe COVID-19 in older people increases with age; a vaccination suitable for this high-risk population is a key goal of the scientists.    The vaccine candidate's lead investigator is Jesse Erasmus, a postdoctoral fellow of microbiology at the University of Washington School of Medicine. Randy Carnell / UW Medicine    This vaccine design, as shown in lab studies, is designed to avoid immune responses that could enhance a respiratory disease induced by the coronavirus. Instead, it directs the immune response toward more protective antiviral measures. In addition to antibody production that can block the infection, the vaccine induces T cells, a type of white blood cell that provides a second line of defense if antibodies don’t completely block the infection.  The methods and results of animal tests of the replicating RNA coronavirus vaccine candidate vaccine are published in the July 20 issue of Science Translational Medicine. The lead author of the paper is Jesse H. Erasmus, a Washington Research Foundation Postdoctoral Fellow in the laboratory of Deborah Heydenberg Fuller. She is a professor of microbiology at the University of Washington School of Medicine and division chief of Infectious Diseases and Translational Medicine at the Washington National Primate Research Center.  As COVID-19 continues to spread, the discovery and widespread distribution of safe and effective vaccines are essential for slamming down the pandemic. Scores of vaccine candidates are in various stages of testing around the world, from preclinical studies to human trials.  “A vaccine that can stop COVID-19,” Fuller wrote, “will ideally induce protective immunity after only a single immunization, avoid immune responses that could exacerbate virus-induced pathology, be amenable to rapid and cost-effective scale-up and manufacturing, and be capable of inducing immunity in all populations including the elderly who typically respond poorly to vaccines.”    This vaccine candidate has several advantages, says Deborah Fuller, the microbiologist whose UW Medicine lab has been the site of its development.    “That’s a tall order,” she added. She sees conventional nucleic acid vaccines as promising, but at least two immunizations are needed to instill immunity in people. Most DNA vaccines require high doses to achieve protective levels of immunity in humans. Traditional messenger RNA vaccines formulated with lipid nanoparticles to increase their effectiveness may face obstacles of mass-production and shelf life.  To try to overcome these limitations, the labs of Fuller and her collaborators at the National Institutes of Health Rocky Mountain Laboratories and HDT Bio Corp. have developed a replicating RNA version of a coronavirus vaccine.  Replicating RNA vaccines for other infectious diseases and cancers are in the pipeline at several institutions. Replicating RNA expresses a greater amount of protein, and also triggers a virus-sensing stress response that encourages other immune activation.  In the case of the COVID-19 vaccine candidate, the RNA enters cells and instructs them to produce proteins that teach the body to recognize coronaviruses and attack them with antibodies and T cells.  This blockade might keep the viruses from fusing to cells and injecting their genetic code for commandeering. These antibodies provide protection by interfering with the protein machinery on the spikes of the coronavirus.  This replicating RNA vaccine contains the novel Lipid InOrganic Nanoparticle (LION) developed by Seattle-based biotechnology company HDT Bio Corp. “We are pleased with the collaboration with UW to move our RNA vaccine platform forward,” said the company’s CEO, Steve Reed.  Amit P. Khandhar, the lead formulation developer, added, “RNA molecules are highly susceptible to degradation by enzymes. LION is a next-generation nanoparticle formulation that protects the RNA molecule and enables in vivo delivery of the vaccine after a simple mixing step at the pharmacy.”    Erasmus holds a tissue culture plate with SARS-CoV-2 plaques, which are used to determine the quantity of infectious virus particles. Photo by Jesse Erasmus    The nanoparticle enhances the vaccine’s ability to provoke the desired immune reaction, and its stability; this vaccine is stable at room temperature for at least one week, and its components enable it to be rapidly manufactured in large quantities, should it prove safe and effective in human trials. The scientists anticipate that lower and fewer doses would need to be made to immunize a population.  A key differentiating factor between LION and the lipid nanoparticle delivery vehicle used in other mRNA COVID-19 vaccines is its ability to be formulated with mRNA by simple mixing at the bedside. The two-vial approach enabled by LION allows for manufacturing of the formulation independently from the mRNA component.  The research team is working to advance the vaccine to Phase 1 testing in people, in which it would be introduced into a small group of healthy volunteers to gather preliminary data on whether it is safe and generates the desired immune response. HDT is advancing the replicon RNA with LION vaccine toward clinical development under the name HDT-301.

Once a COVID-19 vaccine is approved for public use, officials around the world will face the monumental challenge of vaccinating billions of people, a logistical operation rife with thorny ethical questions. What if instead of orchestrating complicated and resource-intensive campaigns to vaccinate humans against emerging infectious diseases like COVID-19, we could instead stop the zoonotic diseases that sometimes leap from animals to people at their source? A small, but growing number of scientists think it’s possible to exploit the self-propagating properties of viruses and use them to spread immunity instead of disease. Can we beat viruses like SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus, at their own game?  A virus that confers immunity throughout an animal population as it spreads in the wild could theoretically stop a zoonotic spillover event from happening, snuffing out the spark that could ignite the next pandemic. If the wild rats that host the deadly Lassa virus, for example, are vaccinated, the risks of a future outbreak among humans could be reduced. For at least 20 years, scientists have been experimenting with such self-spreading vaccines, work that continues to this day, and which has gained the attention of the US military.  For obvious reasons, public and scientific interest in vaccines is incredibly high, including in self-spreading vaccines, as they could be effective against zoonotic threats. The biologists Scott Nuismer and James Bull generated fresh media attention to self-spreading vaccines over the summer after publishing an article in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution. But the subsequent reporting on the topic gives short shrift to the potentially significant downsides to releasing self-spreading vaccines into the environment.  Self-spreading vaccines could indeed entail serious risks, and the prospect of using them raises challenging questions.  Who decides, for instance, where and when a vaccine should be released? Once released, scientists will no longer be in control of the virus. It could mutate, as viruses naturally do. It may jump species. It will cross borders. There will be unexpected outcomes and unintended consequences. There always are.  While it may turn out to be technically feasible to fight emerging infectious diseases like COVID-19, AIDS, Ebola, and Zika with self-spreading viruses, and while the benefits may be significant, how does one weigh those benefits against what may be even greater risks?  How they work. Self-spreading vaccines are essentially genetically engineered viruses designed to move through populations in the same way as infectious diseases, but rather than causing disease, they confer protection. Built on the chassis of a benign virus, the vaccines have genetic material from a pathogen added to them that stimulates the creation of antibodies or white blood cells in “infected” hosts.  These vaccines could be particularly useful, some scientists say, for wildlife populations where direct vaccination is difficult due to issues like inaccessible habitats, poor infrastructure, high costs, or lack of resources. The idea, essentially, is to vaccinate a small proportion of a population through direct inoculation. These so-called founders will then passively spread the vaccine to other animals they encounter either by touch, sex, nursing, or breathing the same air. Gradually, these interactions could build up population-level immunity.  Self-spreading vaccines have some of their roots in efforts to reduce pest populations. Australian researchers described a virally spread immunocontraception, which hijacked the immune systems of infected animals—in this case a non-native mouse species in Australia—and prevented them from fertilizing offspring. The earliest self-spreading vaccine efforts targeted two highly lethal infectious diseases in the European rabbit population (myxoma virus and rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus). In 2001, Spanish researchers field-tested a vaccine in a wild rabbit population living on Isla del Aire, a small Spanish island just off Menorca. The vaccine spread to more than half the 300 rabbits on the island, and the trial was deemed a success.  In 2015, another team of researchers speculated on the development of a self-spreading vaccine for the Ebola virus that could be used on wild great apes like chimpanzees. Since then, scientists have come to see a wide array of animals—from wildlife such as bats, birds, and foxes to domesticated animals like dogs, pigs, and sheep—as amenable to self-spreading vaccines.  So far, researchers have not developed experimental self-spreading vaccines for humans; there is no clear evidence that anybody is actively working on the technology. Nuismer and Bull argue, rather, that self-spreading vaccines present a revolutionary approach to control emerging infectious diseases before they even spill over from animals into the human population.  Zoonotic spillover is certainly a pressing problem; alongside SARS-CoV-2, HIV, Ebola virus, and the Zika virus, there are over a thousand other new viruses with zoonotic potential that have been detected in wild animals over the last decade. Prevention is better than a cure, Nuismer and Bull say in a New Scientist article. In their Nature Ecology & Evolution article, they claim they are “poised to begin developing self-disseminating vaccines to target a wide range of human pathogens” in animals.  Outside of an experiment, scientists would face massive technical and practical hurdles in identifying the most appropriate targets for intervention and ensuring immunity is maintained in the wildlife populations. Despite these substantial challenges, the potential security implications of self-spreading vaccines are even more serious.  The principal security concern is that of dual-use. In essence, this means that the same research that is used to develop self-spreading vaccines to prevent disease, could also be used to deliberately cause harm. You could, for instance, engineer triggers into a virus that cause immune system failures in infected people or animals, a bit like HIV does naturally. Or you could create triggers in a virus that cause a harmful autoimmune response, where the body starts attacking its own healthy cells and tissues.  The bioweapon question. While researchers may intend to make self-spreading vaccines, others could repurpose their science and develop biological weapons. Such a self-spreading weapon may prove uncontrollable and irreversible.  We don’t have to dig very deep for a historical example of weaponized biology. As the apartheid-era South African biowarfare program shows, social, political, and scientific pressures can lead to the misuse of biological innovation.  Codenamed Project Coast, South Africa’s program was primarily focused on covert assassination weapons for use against individuals deemed a threat to the racist apartheid government. In addition to producing contraptions to inject poisons, Project Coast researchers developed techniques to lace sugar cubes with salmonella and cigarettes with Bacillus anthracis.  While there have been many biowarfare programs, including several that were far more elaborate and sophisticated, the South African program is particularly relevant in thinking through malicious uses of self-spreading vaccines. One of Project Coast’s research projects aimed at developing a human anti-fertility vaccine.  The idea took hold during a time of widespread concern over worldwide population explosion. Schalk Van Rensburg, who oversaw fertility-related work at a Project Coast laboratory, told South Africa’s post-apartheid Truth and Reconciliation Commission, a forum for examining the sordid history of the era and laying the foundation for future peace and tolerance, that he thought the project was in line with the World Health Organization’s attempts to curb rising global birth rates. He believed it could bring his lab international acclaim and funding. According to Van Rensburg, Wouter Basson, the director of the biowarfare program, said the military needed an anti-fertility vaccine so that female soldiers would not fall pregnant.  While some of the scientists involved in the project denied awareness of ulterior intentions or even that their fertility work was part of a military endeavor, Van Rensburg and Daniel Goosen, a lab director, told the Truth and Reconciliation Commission that the real intention behind the project was to selectively administer the contraceptive in secret to unwitting Black South African women.  In the end, the anti-fertility vaccine was not produced before Project Coast was officially closed down in 1995, 12 years after it was initiated. An early version was tested in baboons, but never in humans. South Africa isn’t the only country to try and forcibly sterilize parts of its population. European countries, including Sweden and Switzerland, sterilized members of the Roma minority in the early half of the 20th century and some, like Slovakia, continued even beyond that. More recently, analysts have alleged that the Chinese government is sterilizing women in Xinjiang, a province with a large population of Uighur Muslims.  It doesn’t take a massive leap of the imagination to see how the aims of South Africa’s anti-fertility vaccine project would have benefited from research into self-spreading vaccines, particularly if you combine it with current developments in pharmacogenomics, drug development, and personalized medicine. Taken together, these strands of research could help enable ultra-targeted biological warfare.  An expanding potential for abuse. The Biological Weapons Convention, the treaty that bans biological weapons, is nearly 50 years old. Negotiated and agreed to in the depths of the Cold War, the convention suffers from outdated modes of operation. There are also significant compliance assessment challenges. The convention certainly didn’t stop South Africa from pursuing Project Coast in the early 1980s.  Self-spreading vaccine research is a small but growing field. At the moment, about 10 institutions are doing significant work in the area. These laboratories are primarily located in the United States, but some are in Europe and Australia, as well. As the field expands, so does the potential for abuse.  So far research has primarily been bankrolled by US government science and health funders like the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, and the Department of Health and Human Services. Private organizations like the Gates Foundation and academic institutions have also financed projects. Recently, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), sometimes thought of as the US military’s research and development wing, has gotten involved in the research. The University of California, Davis, for example, is working on a DARPA administered project called Prediction of Spillover Potential and Interventional En Masse Animal Vaccination to Prevent Emerging Pathogen Threats in Current and Future Zones of US Military Operation. According to a pamphlet, the project is “creating the world’s first prototype of a self-disseminating vaccine designed to induce a high level of herd immunity (wildlife population level protection) against Lassa virus … and Ebola.”  Military investment in biological innovation for defensive or protective purposes is permissible under the Biological Weapons Convention, but it can still send the wrong signals. It could cause countries to doubt one another’s intentions and lead to tit-for-tat investment in potentially risky research, including in self-spreading vaccines. The result of research gone awry or biowarfare could be catastrophic for health and the environment.  At a time when the norm against chemical weapons is degrading, underscored most recently by the poisoning of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny with the nerve agent Novichok—a crime for which many European officials blame Russia—the international community simply can’t afford to have the same thing happen to the norm against the use of biological weapons. It would completely defy the spirit of the treaty if it seemed like states would even want to pursue high-risk dual use activities in biology.  Early, open, good-faith conversations about scientific aims and advances that cause particular dual-use concerns, as self-spreading vaccines do, are essential to exploring the broader stakes of certain technical trajectories. The University of California, Davis program is pursuing ways to incorporate an “off switch” to safely control the technology. And DARPA says any field experimentation related to the project would follow biosafety protocols. But these pledges won’t suffice. Our ambition must be to make a collective decision about the technical pathways we are willing, or not willing, to take as a society.",Scientists are working on vaccines that spread like a disease.

For some of his 130 million followers, it was a signal.  In the video, someone had posted a comment asking Mr. Bieber to touch his hat if he had been a victim of a child-trafficking ring known as PizzaGate. Thousands of comments were flooding in, and there was no evidence that Mr. Bieber had seen that message. But the pop star’s innocuous gesture set off a flurry of online activity, which highlighted the resurgence of one of social media’s early conspiracy theories.  Viewers quickly uploaded hundreds of videos online analyzing Mr. Bieber’s action. The videos were translated into Spanish, Portuguese and other languages, amassing millions of views. Fans then left thousands of comments on Mr. Bieber’s social media posts asking him if he was safe. Within days, searches for “Justin and PizzaGate” soared on Google, and the hashtag #savebieber started trending.

After receiving a private briefing by Mr. Austin and other military leaders, the president and vice president walked down the corridor at the Pentagon that is dedicated to African-Americans who have fought in the military.  For African-Americans, whose bloodshed on behalf of the military dates to Crispus Attucks in 1770, the lack of representation at the top has been acutely felt, and many Black service members say they see the confirmation of Mr. Austin as long overdue.  The presidential attention on race and the military comes as Mr. Austin himself is trying to grapple with the issue of white supremacy in the military, which has long existed, service members say. It has come to the forefront of public discussion as the authorities continue to disclose the large percentage of veterans and others with military connections who were part of the pro-Trump protesters storming the Capitol last month.  Seeking to address that, Mr. Austin ordered military commanders last week to review the issue of domestic extremism — white supremacy — in the ranks. Commanders have two months to conduct the review, known in Pentagon jargon as a “stand down.” As part of the review, Mr. Austin has asked commanders to talk to troops about the importance of their oath to defend the Constitution, and to remind them not to take part in hate groups.

With the 2021 legislative session scheduled to end April 30, Senate Appropriations Chairwoman Kelli Stargel, who is sponsoring the Senate’s version of the transgender athlete bill, said she needs to devote her time to negotiations with House leaders on the state budget.  Stargel’s proposal would not go as far as a bill passed by the Republican-dominated Florida House last week.  The House bill would require high-school and college sports teams to be designated based on students’ “biological sex,” a disputed term that refers to the sex assigned at birth. It would ban transgender females from taking part in girls’ or women’s high-school and college teams.  Under Stargel’s measure, “athletic teams or sports designated for females, women or girls may not be open to students of the male sex.” But the Senate proposal includes an exception for “persons who transition from male to female” if they meet certain conditions, such as specified testosterone levels.  The Senate Rules Committee was slated to take up Stargel’s bill on Tuesday, but she asked that it be set aside, at least for now.  “I believe Florida should protect the ability of girls and women to safely participate in athletics, and I think there is consensus among my colleagues surrounding that underlying policy objective,” Stargel said in a prepared statement. “We want to get there in a manner that respects the inherent dignity of each person, while at the same time acknowledging the fact that the biological differences between men and women can be significant, and can vary based on how far along a person is within their transition.”  Stargel said she decided to postpone consideration of the bill “as we continue to work on this issue.” But she also acknowledged that time could be running out, adding that “in a time-limited environment, I don’t know that we will have sufficient time to revisit SB 2012 this session.”  The Florida proposals are similar to other controversial measures being considered or passed by Republican-led legislatures throughout the country. LGBTQ allies have condemned the proposals, which Florida Democrats argued could cause the state to miss out on lucrative college-sports championship events.  (©2021 CBS Local Media.

One email exchange, however, shows how even Fauci couldn’t see all that was coming.  Just a day after the first reported COVID-19 death in the United States, the managing editor of ABC News’ medical unit emailed Fauci and asked him if he agreed with what a source at the Department of Homeland Security told him: that epidemiology models showed that 98 million people could be infected with COVID-19 and deaths from the virus could reach 500,000.  “That seems exceptionally high,” Fauci responded.  His guidance was not always welcomed by his own bosses at the White House. He faced a wide range of harassment, including angry tweets from Trump that questioned his expertise.  Those conflicts also get referenced in the emails. In April, a top Chinese health official emailed Fauci about vaccines. As part of that thread, the official expressed concern about him “being attacked by some people.”  “Thank you for your kind note. All is well despite some crazy people in this world,” Fauci replied.  Even as he gained enemies and roused critics, many of the emails also reflect his growing stature around the world.  “Dear — highly respected — Dr. Fauci,” a doctor from Austria writes in bolded text. “Why do I try to childishly support a respected expert and personally highly honored Gentleman like you — Dr. Fauxi? Because for me — it is heartbreaking and unbelievably disturbing, what was and is going on of the last 4 months in the USA.”  He goes on to lay out a strategy for nations to cope with the devastating effects of the pandemic.  “Not a crazy note. Please respond on my behalf,” Fauci writes to a staff member.  On May 5, 2020, Mary Harris, an NIAID employee, wrote: “I am grateful to say my Director is Dr. Anthony Fauci and share with my family, friends, and church that if you said it, it’s gospel.”  Along the way, the scientist was becoming a celebrity. Just a couple of months into the pandemic, T-shirts, bobbleheads, socks, and even prayer candles with his face plastered on them were being sold. Fauci’s emails show he was clearly uncomfortable with the attention.  “Click on the ‘Cuomo Crush’ and ‘Fauci Fever’ link below. It will blow your mind. Our society is really totally nuts,” Fauci wrote in an April 8, 2020, email he forwarded to undisclosed recipients after he received a Google alert about news stories mentioning his name.  The previous month, a colleague had emailed Fauci a Washington Post article headlined “Fauci Socks, Fauci Doughnuts, Fauci Fan Art: The Coronavirus Experts Attract a Cult Following.” The top of the article tells the story of a Rochester, New York, shop that had sold out of donuts with Fauci's face on them.  “Truly surrealistic,” Fauci wrote. “Hopefully this all stops soon.” Later, he added: “It is not at all pleasant, that is for sure.”  But it didn’t stop, and, at times, Fauci actually couldn’t help but get a kick out of it, including when Brad Pitt played him on Saturday Night Live.  “One reviewer of the SNL show said that Pitt looked 'exactly like me.' That statement made my year, ” Fauci wrote to a colleague.  The emails also reveal behind-the-scenes negotiations over a documentary about Fauci’s work. He first sent a note to his team about the project on April 12, a month after the World Health Organization had declared the coronavirus a pandemic.  “Let us discuss this tomorrow before we do anything. No one has any ‘exclusives’ on anything about me,” he wrote to his team.  Still, there is little in his correspondence that strays from the central issues: the pandemic and how best to save lives. His exchanges with Ezekiel Emanuel, the former Obama health adviser, reflect the high stakes.  Emanuel, an oncologist, bioethicist, and vice provost of the University of Pennsylvania, sent Fauci an email on Feb. 25, 2020, asking for an updated assessment of the virus and noting that he was having a “hard time seeing this as serious as everyone else.”  “Am I blind? Yes very transmissible but low mortality like flu in many ways - the elderly, those with comorbidities, and total impact is likely to be less than flu,"" Emanuel wrote.  Later, in April, Emanuel sent Fauci an email saying he was “perplexed” by his “seeming strong endorsement” of the antiviral drug remdesivir to treat COVID-19.  “Was it just a bit forced?” Emanuel asked. “My reading was the data was weak and in normal times for normal disease it is not enough to approve. And very unlikely to really impact COVID-19 disease pattern--regardless of supply issues.”  Fauci countered: “I did not ‘strongly’ endorse it. I specifically said it was not a knockout drug and was only a baby step in the direction of developing more and better drugs. I said that it was important because it proved in a well-powered, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial that one can suppress the virus enough to see a clinical effect, as modest as the effect was. I do not think I forced anything.”  The next day, Emanuel sent another email, apologizing for misinterpreting Fauci’s comments about the drug and inviting him over for dinner “on the porch.”  “You are a national — international — treasure. And we are depending on your sanity and smarts.” ●",Anthony Fauci’s Emails Reveal The Pressure That Fell On One Man,true

A search of the suspect's suburban Denver home turned up other weapons, a senior law enforcement source said Tuesday. The weapon used in the attack was an AR-15-style pistol modified with an arm brace, according to the source.  Authorities have said they believe Alissa was the only person involved and that there was no additional threat to the community.  The suspect has been charged with 10 counts of first-degree murder and one charge of attempted murder, according to his arrest warrant. His first court appearance is scheduled for 8:15 a.m. (10:15 a.m. ET) Thursday, according to Colorado Judicial Branch online records.  The warrant described Alissa as being armed with either an assault rifle or ""black AR-15"" and wearing a ""tactical"" or ""armored"" vest. A senior law enforcement source told CNN on condition of anonymity the shooter used a Ruger AR-556 pistol, modified with an arm brace, and was also carrying a 9 mm handgun, according to the source.  The Boulder Police Department released the booking photograph of suspected gunman Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa.  The suspect had ""removed all of his clothing and was dressed only in shorts"" when he was taken into custody, the affidavit said. Outside the store, the document said, Alissa wouldn't tell police whether there were other suspects, but he did ask to speak to his mother.  Using law enforcement databases, the affidavit said, investigators determined Alissa had purchased a Ruger AR556 pistol on March 16.A law enforcement official told CNN Alissa was not previously the subject of any FBI investigation and said it appears nothing in the federal system would have prohibited Alissa from buying a firearm.

Alissa, whose family emigrated from Syria, may have been suffering from mental illness, according to his 34-year-old brother, Ali Aliwi Alissa.  The brother told CNN on Tuesday that in high school bullies made fun of Alissa's name and for being Muslim and that may have contributed to him becoming ""anti-social.""  ""People chose not to mess with him because of his temper, people chose not to really talk to him because of all -- how he acted and things like that. So yeah, he was very alone,"" said Damien Cruz, who said he has known Alissa since the fifth grade.  Alissa had become increasingly ""paranoid"" around 2014, believing he was being followed and chased, according to his brother. At one point, the young man covered the camera on his computer with duct tape so he could not be seen, said the brother, who lives with Alissa.  ""He always suspected someone was behind him, someone was chasing him,"" Ali Alissa said.  ""We kept a close eye on him when he was in high school. He would say, 'Someone is chasing me, someone is investigating me.' And we're like, 'Come on man. There's nothing.' ... He was just closing into himself,"" the brother added.  Alissa's Facebook page, the authenticity of which was confirmed by his brother and a high school classmate, shows posts saying he believed his former high school had been hacking into his phone.  ""Just curious what are the laws about phone privacy because I believe my old school (a west) was hacking my phone,"" Alissa wrote in a March 18, 2019, Facebook post.  He made a second post on July 5, 2019, also claiming that people were hacking his phone, saying, ""let me have a normal life I probably could.""  When his Facebook friends questioned how he knew the school was hacking his phone, Alissa said: ""I believe part racism for sure. But I also believe someone spread rumors about me which are false and maybe that set it off.""  The profile claims Alissa attended Arvada West High School. Cameron Bell, Jefferson County Public Schools spokesperson, confirmed Alissa was a student there from March 2015 until he graduated in May 2018.  Alissa was not very political or particularly religious, according to his brother, who said he never heard the young man threaten to use violence.  ""The entire thing surprised me,"" Ali Alissa said of the Monday's shootings. ""I never ever would have thought he would do such a thing. I never thought he would kill. I still can't believe it. I am really sad for the lives that he wasted, and I feel sorry for all those families. ... We lost a brother even if he is the killer.""  Aside from a knife he used for cooking, Ali Alissa said he did not know his brother to carry any weapon, including a firearm.  Sister-in-law says she saw suspect playing with a gun  According to the arrest warrant, a woman identified as the suspect's sister-in-law ""stated that (Ahmad Al Aliwi) Alissa was seen playing with a gun she thought looked like a 'machine gun' about 2 days ago. She did not believe the gun looked like the rifles she has seen in old Western movies. . . . Alissa had been talking about having a bullet stuck in the gun and was playing with the gun.""  The woman's name was redacted from the document.  Ali Alissa said he doesn't know why his brother went to King Soopers on Monday. Police interrogated him and another brother, according to Ali Alissa, who said authorities searched their home in the predawn hours Tuesday.  ""They searched every corner,"" he said, ""every piece of clothing.""  The family emigrated from Syria in 2002, the brother said. They have lived in the Arvada area since 2014.  Facebook has shut down Facebook and Instagram accounts belonging to the suspect, a company spokesperson said Tuesday.  Alissa was found guilty of assault in 2018  Alissa was sentenced to one year probation and 48 hours of community service after being found guilty of third-degree assault in 2018 for an incident that occurred the previous November, according to the Colorado Bureau of Investigation's database.  The case stemmed from a incident in which a then-18-year-old Alissa was accused of attacking a classmate at Arvada West High School.  A report from a police officer included in the case file says Alissa ""got up in (a) classroom, walked over to (the) victim & 'cold-cocked' him in the head.""  Alissa ""got on top of (the victim) & punched him in (the) head several more times,"" the report says, adding that the victim ""had bruising, swelling & cuts to (the) head, as well as pain.""  ""No witnesses could see or hear any reason"" for the attack, and Alissa said the victim ""had made fun of him & called him racial names weeks earlier,"" the officer wrote.  Shooting comes 1 week after Atlanta massacre  The mass shooting suspect has made statements to investigators, Dougherty said.  ""We're collecting those statements now and we'll be providing those in the weeks ahead,"" Dougherty said.  Herold said the suspect was wounded in the leg during ""an exchange of gunfire.""  The suspect was taken into custody about 3:30 p.m. Monday and transported to a hospital, where he was in stable condition.  He was booked into Boulder County Jail early Tuesday afternoon, according to the jail's records.  The massacre at the King Soopers store occurred less than a week after shootings at three spas in the Atlanta area left eight people dead. In the past week in the US, there have been at least seven shootings in which at least four people were injured or killed.  The slain Boulder officer, 51-year-old Eric Talley, was the first to respond to the scene, according to Herold. Talley had joined the force in 2010, she said.  The victims were ordinary Coloradans going about their daily lives -- picking up groceries, waiting in line for a coronavirus vaccine. They ranged from 20 to 65 years old.","Here's what we know about the Boulder, Colorado, mass shooting suspect",true

Instead people were left baffled by what appeared to be a secret door on the wall behind them.  One Twitter user, named only as Joe, wrote: ""Call me paranoid but I *think* there's a secret door to the left of Trump...""  Tonty Daal thought the door, which had wallpaper and white wooden panelling to match the rest of the room, did not blend in too effectively.  He said simply: ""I can see the secret door. It's rubbish"".  The door reminded Tim Hoy of the famous Pink Panther character Cato, played by the late Buth Kwouck, who would keep bumbling Inspector Clueso on his toes by jumping out of hidden nooks to attack him.  26 The door reminded this Twitter user of the Pink Panther character Cato Credit: Curu63/Twitter  ""That secret door to Trump's left screams 'Not now Cato!!"" to me"", he wrote.

It was intentionally built to provide easy secondary access to other areas of the White House without putting in proper doors that may ruin the look of the famously round room.  David J Gill, an architect, said: ""The Oval Office has two major doors, three windows and two more window/doors and the two concealed doors.

The meeting with Mrs May, who was the first foreign leader to visit the President since he was sworn in last week, was hailed by the leaders as marking a new dawn for the 'special relationship'.  ""I am honoured to have Prime Minister Theresa May here fur our first official visit from a foreign leader"" he told journalists.  The relationship between America and the UK had ""never been stronger"", he continued, adding: ""Great days lie ahead,"" he added.

President Trump and Theresa May - what did they say? On Russian sanctions: Trump: ""We’ll see what happens. We look to have a great relationship with all countries ideally."" May: “We believe sanctions should continue until the Minsk agreement is implemented.” On their disagreements: May: “The point of the special relationship is so that we can have frank discussions. There are many issues on which we agree”. On Torture: Trump: “General Mattis has stated publicly that he does not agree with torture. I am allowing him to overrule me.” On Mexico: Trump: “We had a very good call. Great respect for Mexico and the Mexican people. As you know Mexico has out-negotiated us. On top of that the border is soft and weak. I’m not going to let that happen. We are going to be working on a fair relationship. But the US cannot afford to lose out anymore. In the end I think it’s going to work out better for both countries”. On Brexit: Trump: “We will be talking to your folks about Brexit. I think Brexit’s going to be a wonderful thing. You are going to have your own identity, make your own free trade deals. Getting approvals from Europe was difficult. I think Brexit will be a fantastic thing for the United Kingdom.""

The pair carried out a traditional exchange of gifts with Mr Trump giving his guest an antique picture of Abraham Lincoln taken from a 1865 edition of Harper’s Weekly magazine.  Her husband Philip got a pair of silver cufflinks.  The pair had around an hour of private meetings ahead of the press conference.

He said: “As I was watching her and listening to her, I thought ‘is this Donald Trump’s long lost sister?""  “There was real similarities while at the same time, clearly a different take on certain global issues but at the same time, a great respect for nationalism and patriotism and certainly national security.”  26 Last night Mrs May said Britain would no longer look to intervene overseas - unless it was seriously under threat Credit: Getty Images  Do you have a story for The Sun Online news team?

318,59172604166439513972360376371555856909,"As we try to come to terms with the extent of Chinese influence over the Biden family, a leaked database of registered members of the Chinese Communist Party has exposed a mass infiltration of American companies — with serious national security implications.  Boeing, Qualcomm and Pfizer are just three US companies that have employed dozens of CCP members in their Chinese facilities, the database reveals.  As well, three female employees of the US consulate in Shanghai have been identified in the list of 1.95 million party members that was leaked to an international group of legislators, the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, which includes Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Bob Menendez (D-NJ).  All CCP members swear an oath to “fight for communism throughout my life, be ready at all times to sacrifice my all for the party and the people, and never betray the party [and] guard party secrets, be loyal to the party.”  Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), a member of the Homeland Security Committee, said yesterday: “CCP agents have no place in US government facilities, and this report should serve as a much-needed wake-up call to Washington, DC, and corporate executives, who continue to welcome the Chinese government with open arms.  “[It] is just more evidence of the extent to which the CCP has successfully infiltrated American companies and government.”  While none of the people listed in the database have been identified as spies, mounting concerns in the State Department about the CCP have resulted in tightened visa rules for its members earlier this month. CCP members and their immediate families now are limited to one-month, single-entry US permits.  The database was verified by international cybersecurity firm Internet 2.0, which found it was originally leaked on encrypted messaging app Telegram in 2016. It was passed on to IPAC six weeks ago by a third party.  “We have high confidence this list is authentic,” Internet 2.0 co-founder David Robinson, a former Australian army intelligence officer, told me Sunday.  “Someone — an insider, a dissident — managed to get physical access to the server [in Shanghai] from outside the building. They didn’t have to hack it over the internet.”  Each data entry contains the CCP member’s name, ethnicity, place of birth, education level, identification number and, in some cases, a phone number and address.  Robinson has verified the identity of three women who work at the US consulate in Shanghai.  The three, all listed as ethnic Han college graduates, are registered in a 31-strong Communist Party branch listed as Shanghai Foreign Institutional Service Co., which is a state-owned employment agency, which provides local staff for foreign consulates, schools and news media.  A department spokesperson yesterday had no comment about “an allegedly leaked database of Communist Party members” and said “the department does not discuss security protocols or personnel matters.”  However, she said: “Influence and interference operations are fundamental to how the Chinese Communist Party engages with the world.  “China’s role in the world today cannot be understood without reference to the wide array of malign activities that the [CCP] undertakes to influence our societies in ways that are covert, coercive and corrupting.”  The CCP database is split into 79,000 branches.  For example, Boeing has 17 branches, totaling 252 CCP members. Sixteen members are part of Boeing’s Hongqiao Maintenance Base Boeing Line Maintenance Division . . . First Workshop Party Branch; 22 are in the Second Workshop Party Branch; 13 are in the Third Workshop Party Branch, 14 in the Fourth Workshop Party Branch.  There are four subdivisions of the Pudong Maintenance Base Boeing Line Maintenance Branch, totaling 49 members.  Two branches of the Pudong Maintenance Base Boeing Line Maintenance Branch Cargo Aircraft Line Maintenance total 33 members.  Also listed are 27 members of the Party Branch of Boeing Fourth Branch of the Flight Department of Eastern Airlines Yunnan Co. and 23 members of the China Eastern Airlines Beijing Maintenance Department Party Committee Boeing Maintenance Workshop Party Branch.  Boeing spokesman Bradley Akubuiro said last night the company was satisfied with its security.  “As a global company, we enforce strict security protocols and maintain secure firewalls to protect both our customer and company proprietary data in all countries we operate in.”  According to the database, 96 members in the Qualcomm Wireless Communication Technology (China) Co. Ltd. Party Branch, and 133 additional members spread over six party branches of Qualcomm Enterprise Management (Shanghai) work for semiconductor manufacturer and 5G wireless technology company Qualcomm, a US-based multinational.  Qualcomm was awarded a contract by the Defense Department in 2018 to develop multifactor authentication security systems for US military computers.  Another US company crucial to national security is pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, which began rolling out COVID-19 vaccines Sunday.  The database lists 69 CCP members in four Pfizer branches in Shanghai.  Neither Qualcomm nor Pfizer responded to inquiries yesterday.  New York University also appears with 71 members attached to a branch named East China Normal University Shanghai New York University Faculty and Labor Party Branch.  The database leak comes just days after a number of disturbing revelations involving CCP infiltration of American institutions:  Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe warned that China has targeted members of Congress and poses “the greatest threat to democracy and freedom” since World War II.  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned of China’s infiltration of US universities, which are “hooked on Communist cash” and stifle criticism of Beijing.  Media reports identified Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), a member of House Intelligence Committee, as one of several San Francisco politicians courted by Chinese spy Christine Fang.  It was confirmed last week that Joe Biden’s son Hunter is under federal investigation over tax fraud and potential money-laundering over his foreign business dealings, including in China.  “Communist China has been allowed to infiltrate our universities and corporations with people loyal to only the Communist Party,” former Acting Director of National Intelligence Ric Grenell said Sunday.  “Our beloved Chinese American community has been warning us about these tactics for many years, and the political class has ignored those warnings.”",US companies riddled with members of Chinese Communist Party: Devine,true

After every military troop surge eventually comes the drawdown, and that’s what is starting to take place in Washington.  National Guard officials say that after about 26,000 troops poured into the city to help protect Wednesday’s inauguration events, they are working to pull troops out and bring them home.  There were no security incidents reported involving the National Guard, officials said in a media release.  “The National Guard is now focusing on coordinating with federal law enforcement to meet any continuing requirements while simultaneously working the logistics to return Guard members to their home states, families, and employers,” the release stated. “As the mission wraps up in the capital region, the National Guard Bureau is working to assist states with preparations and logistics to return troops safely home. ""  Though the inauguration ended safely, “we will continue to support federal law enforcement as requested,” said Army Gen. Daniel Hokanson, chief of the National Guard. “Our Guard members will return home as soon as conditions permit.”  On Jan. 6, then-acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller approved up to 6,200 National Guard troops to support civil authorities in the District of Columbia for up to 31 days under Title 32, 502(f) authority  About 10,600 troops remain on duty right now, Air Force Maj. Matthew Murphy, an NGB spokesman, told Military Times. The other 15,000 troops are in the process of heading back home now, he said.  “The planning and process may take several days, but arrangements are being made to return close to 15,000 troops as soon as possible and should conclude within a five to 10-day period,” Murphy said. “Demobilization is involved with equipment turn-in and accountability, travel arrangements, COVID screening and mitigation. Troops will leave by ground transportation, airlift provided by the Air National Guard and contracted commercial air as necessary.”  But about 7,000 troops will remain through the end of the month, he said.  “Some agencies are requesting continuity of operations, additional support and recuperation time for their forces to regroup. Approximately 7,000 National Guard personnel are anticipated to provide that assistance through the end of the month,” said Murphy.  RELATED  D.C. National Guard troops will remain on-post until at least Jan. 30, Mayor Muriel Bowser said during a Thursday afternoon press conference. Future deployment of the DCNG depends on future threats, she said.  “We are evaluating … what we think would be intelligence from federal partners that suggest the need” for continued or future DCNG presence in the city,” she said.  Bowser said she asked Christopher Rodriguez, director of the city’s Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency, to “begin working with our partners to deal with the threat of white extremism and any other threat to our city.”  Rodriguez said that “the threat of right-wing extremism is here. You saw it on Jan. 6. It continues to be a persistent and real threat to the District of Columbia and the region.”  RELATED  Before the deadly Jan. 6 Capitol siege by supporters of then-President Donald Trump, Bowser said there was no reason to consider calling in the Guard to help protect the Capitol during joint sessions of Congress, like the election certification process that was taking place when the building was stormed.  But in the wake of that event, which took the lives of five people, including Air Force veteran and Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, Bowser said security changes need to be made.  “It is very clear any joint session of Congress should be a special security event or some package like that,” she said.  The next such event is likely to be President Joe Biden’s address to Congress, which will probably take place some time in February.  Hokanson, the NGB chief, said the public has been grateful for the help.  “The outpouring of support to our National Guard across the entire country, and here in the District of Columbia, is a story in itself. I want to particularly thank the citizens of the District of Columbia,” said Hokanson.

Four other people died during the stunning attack at the heart of American democracy as mob members vandalized the building and assaulted police officers. One woman was fatally shot by police and three people died of apparent medical emergencies.  Several DC Metropolitan Police officers were also injured during the insurrection, police Chief Robert Contee said. One officer had significant facial injuries from being struck by a projectile, and another officer was hospitalized after being pepper-sprayed.  Here's what we know about the people who died:  Officer dies after being injured  Capitol Police released a statement saying Officer Brian D. Sicknick passed away Thursday night ""due to injuries sustained while on-duty.""  Officer Sicknick was injured while physically engaging with the rioters and collapsed after returning to his division office. ""He was taken to a local hospital where he succumbed to his injuries,"" the Capitol Police statement said.  Officer Sicknick joined the USCP in July 2008, and most recently served in the Department's First Responder's Unit.  ""The entire USCP Department expresses its deepest sympathies to Officer Sicknick's family and friends on their loss, and mourns the loss of a friend and colleague,"" Capitol Police added.  His death is now being investigated.  United States Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick  Sicknick was originally from South River, New Jersey, and the youngest of three sons, according to a statement issued by his brother on behalf of his family.

Phil Murphy's office, Sicknick was a staff sergeant for the New Jersey National Guard. He served as a fire team member and a leader of the 108th Security Force Squadron, 108th Wing, at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, Murphy's statement said.  Sicknick's service included two deployments -- one as part of Operation Southern Watch and another as part of Operation Enduring Freedom, Murphy said.

The woman was given medical assistance immediately and taken to a hospital, where she was pronounced dead.  Authorities identified her as Ashli Babbitt, a 35-year-old from Huntington, Maryland.  Babbit's mother, Michelle Witthoeft told CNN on Thursday she was devastated to learn of her daughter's death.  ""I loved and admired her greatly,"" Witthoeft said of Babbitt. ""She served this country boldly and proudly.""  Babbitt was an ardent Trump supporter who held strong political views, her mother said, and was ""passionate enough to die for what she believed in.""  Babbitt, who was previously married but separated from her husband in 2019, frequently attended pro-Trump rallies. She flew to Washington, DC, from San Diego, California, with the intent to participate in the protest this week, her mother said.  ""Her political views were strong and adamant, and she voiced them whenever she could,"" Witthoeft said.

She also shared content promoting political conspiracy theories often pushed by far-right figures.  Babbitt served as a senior airman in the US Air Force from 2004 to 2008 under the name Ashli Elizabeth McEntee, according to military records. She was a member of the Air Force Reserve from 2008 to 2010 and was in the Air National Guard from 2010 until November 2016, records show.  ""She served in the United States Air Force and was deployed four times and came back safely, only to have her own country shoot her down,"" Witthoeft said tearfully by phone.  The US Capitol Police employee who shot Babbitt has been placed on administrative leave and their police powers have been suspended pending a joint Metro Police and USCP investigation, USCP said.  ""This is a tragic incident, and I send my condolences to the victim's family and friends,"" Metro Police Chief Contee said.  Two people who saw the shooting, left-wing activist John Sullivan and documentary filmmaker Jade Sacker, provided CNN with video of the incident and described the moments beforehand.  Sullivan said rioters were using flag poles and other items to smash glass windows inside the Capitol. The woman then tried to make her way through the window when several people with guns came out through the doorways.  ""The second that she climbed through the window she got shot right in the neck area, fell backwards,"" Sullivan said in an interview that broadcast on CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360.""  ""I just remember the sense of shock and sorrow that somebody just died and did not need to die.""  The woman was trying to enter an area that did not yet appear to have been breached by rioters, Sullivan said.  ""It was an area that was completely blocked off,"" he said. ""They had chairs up against the doorway, tables, so people couldn't get in.""  Three others dead  Three other people who had come from out of state died of ""medical emergencies"" during the riot, police said.  ""One adult female and two adult males appear to have suffered from separate medical emergencies, which resulted in their deaths,"" Contee said. ""Any loss of life in the District is tragic and our thoughts are with anyone impacted by their loss.""  They were identified as Benjamin Philips, 50, of Ringtown, Pennsylvania; Kevin Greeson, 55, of Athens, Alabama; and Rosanne Boyland, 34, of Kennesaw, Georgia. The three were on the grounds of the Capitol when they experienced their medical emergencies, Contee said.  Kevin Greeson  Greeson had a history of high blood pressure and suffered a heart attack amid the excitement, his family said in a statement to CNN. He was an advocate of Trump and attended the event to show his support.  ""He was excited to be there to experience this event,"" the statement said. ""He was not there to participate in violence or rioting, nor did he condone such actions.""  The family says they are devastated by the loss.  ""Kevin was a wonderful father and husband who loved life,"" the family statement said. ""He loved to ride motorcycles, he loved his job and his coworkers, and he loved his dogs.""  Boyland's family is also mourning her death, her brother-in-law, Justin Cave, told CNN affiliate WGCL . The family is still working to learn more details about the specifics of her death, he said.  As the family watched Wednesday's events, they hoped that Boyland wasn't among the crowd, Cave said. ""Tragically she was there and it cost her life,"" he said.

Data from an AFP database collated compulsory or recommended confinements, curfews and quarantines in more than 90 countries or territories.  Due to the introduction of a curfew in Thailand (effective from Friday), the threshold of 50% of humanity will be reached.  Meanwhile, the number of dead in Spain from coronavirus has now risen above 10,000, according to the latest health authority figures published on Thursday.  It's a new record for the country, with 950 deaths in the last 24 hours.  The total number of deaths stands at 10,003, with a total of 110,238 confirmed cases in Europe's worst affected nation after Italy.  However, the infection rate appeared to ease. Health authorities say contagion in Spain has dropped from a daily average of 20% until March 25 to less than 12% after that date, more than 10 days after Spaniards were ordered to stay home.  But the government has acknowledged that the real number of infections could be much higher due to limited testing.  The figures also show that more people are recovering. The total now stands at 26,743 in Spain -- up from 22,647 the previous day. That number represents more than 20% of the overall number of cases.  There were reasons for optimism from Italy, too, late on Thursday afternoon. The number of new infections continues to fall, down to 4668, a slight fall on Wednesday's figures, and a drop of 1,500 compared with a week ago.  Italy's daily death toll was 760, a slight increase against yesterday, but down from the more than 9,000 fatalities announced last Friday.  Unemployment soars  Spain also reported catastrophic unemployment figures on Thursday, evidence of the devastating effect the pandemic is having on the economy. Jobless numbers rose by over 300,000 in March, the highest increase on record, Euronews' Spanish service reports.  The number of people out of work has risen far more sharply than happened during the financial crisis of 2008, Spanish media say.  The European Union has designed a new programme to raise up to €100 billion to tackle surging unemployment brought on by the pandemic.  The aim of the scheme, called SURE, is to provide financial assistance to the 27 member states via loans from the EU. ""Only the strongest of responses will do,"" European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said in Brussels on Thursday.

In the worst-affected countries health resources are being massively stretched.

In a video message produced in conjunction with the Ad Council, Pope Francis praised the work of researchers and scientists in producing safe and effective Covid-19 vaccines.  “Thanks to God’s grace and to the work of many, we now have vaccines to protect us from Covid-19,” he said in the video released on Wednesday.  He added that vaccines “bring hope to end the pandemic, but only if they are available to all and if we collaborate with one another.”  Vaccination is an act of love  Pope Francis went on to say that getting a Covid jab that is “authorized by the respective authorities” is an “act of love.”  Helping other do the same, he said, is also an act of love. “Love for oneself, love for our families and friends, and love for all peoples. Love is also social and political.”  The Pope noted that social and political love is built up through “small, individual gestures capable of transforming and improving societies.”  “Getting vaccinated is a simple yet profound way to care for one another, especially the most vulnerable,” he said.  Pope Francis then prayed to God that “each one of us can make his or her own small gesture of love.”  “No matter how small, love is always grand,” he said. “Small gestures for a better future.”  Listen to our report  ‘Strength of faith’  The Pope was joined in the video by several Cardinals and Archbishops from across the Americas.  Archbishop Jose Gomez, president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and the Archbishop of Los Angeles, lamented the suffering and death the pandemic has wrought across the globe.  He prayed that God might “grant us the grace to face it with the strength of faith, ensuring that vaccines are available for all, so that we can all get immunized.”  Mexican Cardinal Carlos Aguiar Retes linked Covid-19 jabs to a better future for all.  “From North to South America, we support vaccinations for all,” said the Cardinal.  Safe, effective vaccines  Honduran Cardinal Rodriguez Maradiaga said the world has much to learn from the coronavirus.  “But one thing is certain: the authorized vaccines are effective, and are here to save lives,” he said. “They are the key to a path of personal and universal healing.”  Brazilian Cardinal Claudio Hummes praised the “heroic efforts” of health professionals in developing “safe and effective” jabs.  He also repeated the Pope’s affirmation that “getting vaccinated is an act of love”.  Salvadorian Cardinal Gregorio Rosa Chavez said vaccination helps protect the most vulnerable.  “Our choice to get vaccinated affects others,” he said, adding that it is a moral responsibility.  Unity across the Americas  Peruvian Archbishop Miguel Cabrejos rounded out the testimonies contained in the video with an appeal to unity.  “We are united—North, Central, and South America and the Caribbean—to promote and support vaccination for all,” he said, encouraging everyone to “act responsibly, as members of the great human family, seeking and protecting our integral health and universal vaccination.”",Pope Francis urges people to get vaccinated against Covid-19,true

FAUCI'S ‘GET OVER THIS POLITICAL STATEMENT’ COMMENT ON VACCINES GETS PANNED  Becerra said people didn't have to answer the door but he hoped they would so officials could dispel rumors about the vaccine, which has proven to be highly effective in driving down cases, hospitalizations and deaths. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly 56% of the adult population has been ""fully vaccinated"" and 67% has gotten at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine.  States that tend to vote Republican have reported lower vaccination rates, and polls show Republican voters are far more likely than Democrats to say they will not or likely will not get the vaccine. The issue has become part of a larger debate over public health measures colliding with Americans' personal freedoms.

President Biden on Wednesday warned Americans they may have to cancel “small” outdoor gatherings on the Fourth of July if there’s a slowdown of COVID-19 vaccinations.  More than 51 percent of American adults have received at least one vaccine dose, according to CDC data, indicating that herd immunity and the pandemic’s end are near.  But Biden said at the White House that he’s not yet comfortable saying people can hold small outdoor gatherings on Independence Day.  “Back on March 11, I outlined a vision of what America could look like by the Fourth of July — an America that was much closer to normal life that we left behind more than a year ago,” Biden said.  He warned: “To celebrate our independence from this virus on July 4th with family and friends in small groups, we still have more to do in the months of May and June. We all need to mask up until the number of cases goes down, until everyone has a chance to get their shot.”  Biden proposed in a March primetime address that people could host “small” outdoor gatherings for the summer holiday. The idea drew Republican criticism due to the efficacy of vaccines and low outdoor transmission rates.  Retired Admiral Brett Giroir, assistant secretary of health last year, countered Biden, saying that “by July, we should be almost back to normal with herd immunity, with everybody getting vaccines.”  “I don’t know what reality he’s talking about,” Giroir said. “It seemed very disconnected from the reality and where we are and what the science says. Science says small gatherings outdoors is fine.”  Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said “the president’s proclamation was far out of step with what’s already happening across the country.”  In March, Biden said Americans likely could hold small gatherings to celebrate in July. Andrew Harnik, File/AP  “It was advice for an alternate universe. The president and his advisers may need to get out more,” McConnell said. “”Americans are already getting together in small groups outdoors in blue states and red states, in small towns and big cities.

""My desire is to get to them, not to just make an arrest, but to get to them and to try and figure out if they would be willing to work with us on something that is an alternative,"" Breed said at a Violence Prevention Summit hosted by the Human Rights Commission in August. ""We can’t just put them in a program without making sure that they have money, without making sure that they have something to take care of themselves.""  Shootings have spiked in the city this year, with 119 recorded gun crime victims in the first half of the year, which is double the number during the same timeframe in 2020.  The program follows a similar one in Richmond, California, which was dubbed ""cash for criminals"" by the media after gun crimes increased. A 2019 study credited the program with helping reduce gun homicides in the city by 55%.  Critics of the program have pointed out that similar initiatives haven't been very successful, with the Washington Examiner's David Freddoso saying in a Wednesday op-ed, ""It was also tried in Sacramento, where its promoters boast that ‘only’ 44% of participants were subsequently arrested on new charges — well, as long as you don't count about one-third of the participants who dropped out or were arrested in its first six months. (D'oh!)""  ""Violent criminals need jail. They do not need cash. People who shoot other people need to be walled off in prisons and kept away from the rest of us,"" he added.  ONE CALIFORNIA CITY IS PAYING PEOPLE NOT TO COMMIT CRIMES  The move comes as California also works to become the first state to pay drug addicts a few hundred dollars to stay sober.  Gov. Gavin Newsom asked the federal government last week for permission to use tax dollars to pay for the program through Medicaid. Meanwhile, a similar proposal is also working through California's Legislature, with the state Senate already passing the bill.

Annabelle Gaston, 28, was arrested last year after calling 911 when her husband, Irwin Gaston, 31, had a cardiac arrest while apparently being suffocated to death.  Gaston told the 911 operator at the time that she was sitting on her husband’s face while he was giving her cunnilingus when she realized his skin had changed color.  “We were having sex and he started eating my pussy […] I was just sitting on his face for like 25 minutes when his legs turned a greenish-blue color,” she told the 911 operator at the time, in horror.  According to Gaston’s lawyer, Irwin Gaston “liked to insert his head inside my client’s vagina” and “my client warned him on multiple occasions that it was a dangerous practice” he told the judge.  Franklin County District Court Judge Henry Miller sentenced Annabelle Gaston to 10 years and six months after he judged her sexual practices “extremely dangerous behavior” and a “completely reckless conduct” for a woman of her size.  To prove this, the prosecutor showed documents attesting that paramedics took at least 12 minutes to release the head of Irwin Gaston from the inside of Annabelle Gaston’s genitals.  “The time of death is estimated to be 17 minutes before the 911 call and 59 minutes after Irwin Gaston’s head was removed from the inside of the defendant’s genitals,” he said in court before delivering his sentence.  Irwin Gaston was also hospitalized last year only weeks after the couple’s honeymoon after “large amounts of fecal matter” had entered his lungs “during oral-anal intercourse” according to a medical report presented in court.",480-pound woman charged with involuntary manslaughter after husband died while performing oral sex,false
333,216951100434653711934824375027677351237,"A new report from Italy’s Higher Institute of Health provides an objective analysis of the nation’s misleading covid-19 death tally. Italy’s official covid death tally rose to 132,161 in October of 2021. This tally is unrealistic because covid-19 was diagnosed in haste and under conditions of financial bribery using non-specific diagnostic criteria.  Covid-19 was often listed as the cause of death when it was merely “suspected” and when “it could not be ruled out.”  After careful review of the medical reports, it turns out that respiratory infections may have been a contributing factor but did not cause most of these covid-19 deaths outright.  Various forms of medical malpractice, withheld treatment, inhumane isolation, undernourishment, and unethical standards of care are at the root of this worldwide medical crisis. The deaths are real, but the causes are skewed.  New medical analysis reduces Italy’s covid-19 death tally by 97.1%  A new analysis reduced Italy’s covid-19 death tally by 97.1 percent and provided a more accurate picture as to why these people died in the hospital. Only 3,783 cases could be directly correlated with a covid-19 diagnosis. Because the PCR test (that was designed to detect covid-19) was fraudulently-calibrated from the start, even these 3,783 cases of covid-19 are suspect.  Symptoms of respiratory infection could have been the result of any number of infections that kill people every year, whether that be influenza, tuberculosis, pneumonia or countless other lower and upper respiratory tract infections. Viral infections do not have the same effect on one person to the next due to several underlying factors including the cellular and microbiome terrain, so it is extremely difficult to accurately diagnose a specific respiratory infection and quantify viral load.  According to this new analysis, only 2.9% of the deaths registered since the end of February 2020 have been caused by the novel SARS coronavirus that has never been isolated from humans and replicated in human tissue samples. The annual respiratory infections, antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections, medical errors and other acute medical emergencies that usually cause overcrowding in hospitals were used as propaganda to terrorize and defraud the world into perpetual lock down.  The covid-19 death tally included Italians who suffered from one to five underlying chronic diseases; many were on immune suppressant drugs, and a certain percentage died from medical emergencies that are totally unrelated to covid-19. A total of 67.7% suffered from more than three chronic diseases that had not been resolved through modern medicine. Italians who were already suffering from chronic conditions went on to suffer further from ventilator-associated pneumonia and ventilator-associated lung damage.  One in ten of the deceased patients had a stroke; 65.8% of the Italians had arterial hypertension and were on immune-suppressant drugs; 15.7% suffered from heart failure; 28% had ischemic heart disease; and 24.8% suffered from atrial fibrillation. At least 17.4% already had sick lungs. Many (29.3% had diabetes and other metabolic ailments) that drastically impacted their immune response.  There were several patients (16.3%) who were on their deathbed, struggling on immunosuppressant chemotherapy and radiation drugs known to make people susceptible to any respiratory infection.  These cancer patients had been dealing with cancer for the past five years, with an average three-to-five-year chemotherapy survival rate coming to a close. Another 23.5% were struggling with dementia, their life coming to a close.  Unethical, inhumane practices have been implemented in medical systems worldwide  Ever since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a worldwide pandemic of SARS-CoV-2, medical systems around the world have handled hospitalized patients differently. Patients with any sort of respiratory symptom were isolated and separated from family members.  “Out of an abundance of caution,” hospital systems made vague diagnoses, classifying anyone “suspected of covid” as an official case of SARS-CoV-2. These patients were viewed as highly contagious vectors of disease that should be isolated and put on mechanical ventilation.  Efficacious treatments were bypassed. People dying on ventilators were classified as covid deaths “when covid-19 could not be ruled out as the primary cause of their death.”  As terror and fear were propagated across the media, hospital systems put non-urgent, elective procedures on hold, suspending routine outpatient services that left many chronic patients without adequate medical care.  Industrialized nations like Italy did not implement at-home treatment plans and did not distribute nutraceuticals and prophylactics to help control respiratory disease in the population. This caused populations to be dependent on an already overcrowded system that is not set up to deal with panic, ignorance and helplessness.  As nations continue to put all their stock in retrovirus-contaminated influenza vaccines and experimental gene interference coronavirus vaccines, people continue to suffer and die, even as countless anti-viral, bronco-dilating, anti-inflammatory immune therapies exist.

334,84637067928660119077532762666239802563,"Failed California Governor Gavin Newsom got a rude awakening, literally, when he first opened his eyes Monday morning following a 11-day-long vaccine-induced coma that he fell into shortly after receiving a Covid-19 booster shot. The first thing Newsom saw through eyes opened to narrow slits were a Navy physician removing an intubation tube from his mouth and Rear Adm. Crandall looming over the hospital bed on which he lay.  Newsom tried to cough, but he hadn’t the strength. Frail and gaunt, the ever-thin Newsom had lost so much weight, he looked more inhuman than human. He winced as if in pain as the physician waved a penlight before his eyes.  “We’re delighted your still with us,” Rear Adm. Crandall told him, according to a GITMO source familiar with the incident.  “What the?” Newsom gurgled. “I’m in hell. My wife, my kids.  “They’re fine, which is more than can be said about you. Looks like that vaccine you push so hard didn’t work too well for you,” Rear Adm. Crandall reportedly said.  Newsom’s breath came slow and shallow. He choked on his words, struggling to speak. “Placebo. I was supposed to get a placebo.”  “You Deep Staters are always double-crossing one another,” Rear Adm. Crandall said. “When medically fit, you will be put on trial, held accountable for thousands of fatalities. Enjoy this reprieve while you can.”  JAG and the Office of Military Commissions will seek the death penalty, our source said. Although he was unable to provide to RRN a complete list of charges, he said that JAG will hold Newsom to account for the deaths of “thousands” of senior citizens and 600 California children who had developed lethal staph infections from prolonged mask usage, as well as 4,000 vaccine-related fatalities that he had obfuscated by ordering the California Department of Public Health to blame the deaths on other causes, like heart attacks, diabetic shock, aneurisms, etc.  JAG, our source added, has already subpoenaed witnesses to testify against Newsom, including members of his staff, employees of CDPH, and friends and family privy to his wanton corruption. Several potential witnesses expressed joy at the idea of seeing Newsom hang, while others had to be finagled—comply or be charged as an accomplice.  Lesser charges, which JAG might not pursue at trial, include Newsom’s “pay-for-pandemic” scheme, in which he accepted $30m in “campaign contributions” from the CEOs of Netflix, Hulu, and other streaming services in exchange for keeping movie theaters and entertainment centers shut down during the plandemic. The endgame was to boost sales for struggling streaming services and, in turn, bankrupt the theater industry.  “There’s enough evidence on Newsom as there was on Cuomo, if not more. His fate is pretty much sealed. I imagine right now he’s wishing that vaccine actually killed him,” our source said.

336,38056040435265022786313852701488768470,"Pfizer Confirms COVID-Vaccinated People Can ‘Shed’ Spike Proteins And Harm The Unvaccinated  A new study has confirmed that people who have been vaccinated against COVID produce excessive spike proteins that are capable of passing the Blood Brain Barrier causing irreparable damage to the brain — and Pfizer’s own documents warn that vaccinated people actually shed these excessive spike proteins putting the unvaccinated at risk for harm:  In their latest issue brief, America’s Frontline Doctors (AFLDS) warned how spike proteins resulting from experimental COVID-19 gene therapy vaccines have the capacity to 1.) pass through the “blood-brain barrier” causing neurological damage, 2.) be “shed” by the vaccinated, bringing about sickness in unvaccinated children and adults, and 3.) cause irregular vaginal bleeding in women.  Released last week and titled “Identifying Post-vaccination Complications & Their Causes: an Analysis of Covid-19 Patient Data,” the stated purpose of the document is “to provide additional information for concerned citizens, health experts, and policymakers about adverse events and other post-vaccination issues resulting from the three experimental COVID-19 vaccines currently administered under EUA (emergency use authorization)” by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  The non-profit organization highlighted the thousands of adverse events which are related to these “vaccines” and captured by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). “Yet these complications have received a fraction of the attention paid to J&J’s blood-clotting controversy,” they lamented with dismay, asking, “Why?”  In taking a closer look at this data, AFLDS presents “some major categories of concern as-yet publicly unaddressed by either the FDA or CDC,” asserting that failure of these regulators “to consider these and other ‘known unknowns’ is a dereliction of basic medical research.”  They breakout their general categories of concern as shown below:  First, there are significant fears regarding the wide distribution of these new vaccines, which employ a new technology and remain only experimental without full approval from the FDA. Instead of employing an attenuated antigen response – as happens with conventional vaccines – these experimental agents introduce something called a “spike protein” into one’s system.  “It takes years to be sure something new is safe,” the AFLDS document confirms. “No one knows definitively the long-term health implications for the body and brain, especially among the young, related to this spike protein. In addition, if documented problems with the protein do arise, there will never be any way to reverse the adverse effects in those already vaccinated.”  Second, unlike conventional vaccines, these spike proteins, along with “lipid nanoparticles” have the capacity to pass through the “blood-brain barrier” which provides special protection for these sensitive areas of the body.  “There simply has not been enough time to know what brain problems and how often a brain problem will develop from that,” the document warns.  Risks from such penetration include “chronic inflammation and thrombosis (clotting) in the neurological system, contributing to tremors, chronic lethargy, stroke, Bell’s Palsy and ALS-type symptoms. The lipid nanoparticles can potentially fuse with brain cells, resulting in delayed neuro-degenerative disease. And the mRNA-induced spike protein can bind to brain tissue 10 to 20 times stronger than the spike proteins that are (naturally) part of the original virus.”  Third, as these experimental vaccines produce many trillions of spike proteins in their recipients, these vaccinated individuals “can shed some of these (spike protein) particles to close contacts,” causing disease in them.  In an email correspondence with LifeSiteNews, Dr. Simone Gold, the founder of AFLDS, directed this writer to an April 29 tweet where she posted a document from Pfizer’s experimental trials in which the pharmaceutical giant “acknowledges this mechanism” of potential shedding, she wrote.  As the document states, one can be “exposed to [the] study intervention due to environmental exposure,” including “by inhalation or skin contact” with someone involved in the study, or with another who has been exposed in the same way.  And this, according to AFLDS, can be dangerous. As the issues brief continues, “the spike proteins are pathogenic (‘disease causing’) just like the full virus.” Furthermore, these “spike proteins bind more tightly than the fully intact virus” and thus cases around the world of “pericarditis, shingles, pneumonia, blood clots in the extremities and brain, Bell’s Palsy, vaginal bleeding and miscarriages have been reported in persons who are near persons who have been vaccinated.” Such shedding also “appears to be causing wide variety of autoimmune disease (where the body attacks its own tissue) in some persons.”  In addition, other more serious dangers to even the unvaccinated are possible due to the fact that these “spike proteins can cross the blood brain barrier, unlike traditional vaccines.”  Fourth, such shedding leaves children vulnerable if they are in proximity to parents and teachers who have received these experimental vaccines. While the threat of COVID-19 to the young is rightly described as “irrelevant,” including a 99.997% survival rate for those under 20 years of age, AFLDS is concerned some children may become symptomatic due to such proximity to the vaccinated. At such point there is a danger that “public health bureaucrats” might use such cases to “speculate that a child’s illness is related to a SARS-CoV-2 ‘variant,’” when it is a result of contact with vaccinated adults.  “Our other concern is that children could develop long-term chronic autoimmune disease including neurological problems due to the fact that children have decades ahead of them and trillions of the spike proteins mentioned above.”  Fifth, “AFLDS is aware of thousands of reports involving vaginal bleeding, post-menopausal vaginal bleeding, and miscarriages following COVID-19 vaccination as well as anecdotal reports of similar adverse events among those in close contact with the vaccinated.” While at this point the independent physicians organization “cannot comment definitively on the close contacts” other than to mention they “have heard reports of this worldwide,” the many reported incidents of post-vaccination vaginal bleeding establishes a clear “connection between the vaccine and irregular bleeding.”  “Despite this clear-cut evidence, menstrual-cycle changes were not listed among the FDA’s common side effects in its phase-three clinical participants. Women’s reproductive health needs to be taken seriously rather than waved away by agenda-driven public health officials,” the brief reads.  Finally, acknowledging the “irrepressible economic incentive among pharmaceutical companies” to market unnecessary and dangerous childhood COVID vaccines, boosters, and the like, AFLDS insists “Public health experts should stop and assess data on possible vaccine side effects and related post-vaccination questions before it is too late.”",Pfizer Confirms COVID-Vaccinated People Can ‘Shed’ Spike Proteins And Harm The Unvaccinated,false
337,2273587750945679639086029673391855747,"(Natural News) Dr. Judy Mikovits was recently interviewed on Brighteon Conversations, and she did not hold back unveiling the real causes of transfection behind SARS-CoV-2 and the scientific fraud that was used to promote a pandemic and suppress people’s immune systems. Dr. Mikovits was formerly a government virologist who purified and studied viruses. She created cell lines that support viral replication, to understand how they create infection in humans. She is the author of Ending Plague, A Scholar’s Obligation in an Age of Corruption.  Dr. Mikovits confirmed that isolated, certified reference material for SARS-CoV-2 does not exist. The virus has never been isolated from human cells and was never a human virus in the first place. The SARS-CoV-2 virus can only be manufactured and replicated in the vero monkey kidney cell line, which is a group of epithelial cells extracted from African green monkeys in the 1960s. These monkey cell lines, readily contaminated with latent retroviruses, have been injected into the population since the mid-90s through the flu, MMR and polio vaccine supply, and are the only originating vector by which SARS-CoV-2 can manifest disease in humans.  Evidence points to SARS-CoV-2 being deployed through vaccine supply  Every bio-safety level 4 lab that claimed to isolate SARS-CoV-2 from humans ultimately placed the sample in a monkey kidney cell line to “prove” its replication. This virus is not a truly isolated human virus because it could only be replicated in the monkey kidney cell line. To determine whether SARS-CoV-2 is an infectious human virus, it must be taken from the blood, sputum, or lung lavage of an infected human, but the infectious RNA of SARS-CoV-2 was never cultured in a continuously growing human cell line that supports the replication of SARS-CoV-2. Since this novel coronavirus only replicates demonstrably in vero monkey cell lines, it has never been proven to originate or spread from human-to-human, let alone spread from healthy people.  Since the current flu, MMR and polio vaccines contain these same vero monkey cell lines, the only way to deploy SARS-CoV-2 is through transfection via these needles. SARS-CoV-2 is a lab-made sequence that originates and spreads through the existing influenza vaccine supply. This could be why the Department of Defense discovered that flu vaccine recipients from 2017-2018 were increasingly susceptible to coronavirus interference.  “When you take a synthetic part of a virus and you grow it in the monkey cells, you can get recombination events of all the monkey viruses, so it’s a monkey virus,” Mikovits confirmed, referring to the respiratory infections seen in covid-19. The HIV component comes from the Simian immune deficiency virus, which is also a natural monkey virus.  The vector that promises to save humanity is the tool being used to transfect us  Mikovits confirmed that Fauci knew about, funded and acquired cell lines and genetic material from biosecurity labs in the US that could be further weaponized in Wuhan. Mikovits said these virus experiments using the monkey cell line can create endless variants. “Two amino acid changes in the envelop of the spike can change a leukemia virus to a Parkinson-causing virus,” she said, citing her previous lab research. These sequences can be readily changed in the lab, creating endless variants of the same causative agent.  Yet, the errors of vaccine science are easily blamed on nature, which is why Dr. Anthony Fauci and everyone involved in these unethical human-virus experiments are rushing to force and mandate new vaccines onto the population, to control the narrative and cover up their crimes. Dr. Fauci and Dr. Daszak coordinated with Big Tech to censor scientific debate on the origins of SARS-CoV-2, because their virus research is an error of vaccine science that has poisoned the population and primed people to new infections for years.  Dr. Fauci and Dr. Daszak coordinated with media outlets and intimidated their colleagues into silence over the origins of SARS-CoV-2 because they were using no-see-um techniques to create these sequences in monkey cells. The no-see-um approach used in gain-of-function research, pressures the recombination process in the monkey cell line, and the resulting viral creation is unknown. Now the envelope of the virus, the S-1 sub-unit of the coronavirus spike protein, is assaulting the human population through the very vectors by which scientists like Fauci promised to save us. These new infectious sequences are in the cell lines which are then injected into the population via vaccination.

The decision to hang Clinton, a JAG source told Real Raw News, was not reached swiftly because Rear Adm. Crandall was initially uncertain whether legal precedence supported the execution of a criminal not convicted of murder or treason. Although the 3-officer panel recommended capitol punishment, Rear Adm. Crandall sought council instead of making a unilateral judgment.  On October 28, two days after Clinton’s conviction, Rear Adm. Crandall tasked 6 senior JAG officers with deciding whether Clinton should be hanged or spend life at Guantanamo Bay. Until that point, all executions took place after a military tribunal found the accused guilty of murder and/or treason, clearly defined capitol offenses worthy of a hanging or firing squad. Trafficking in foreign children, as opposed to American ones, “muddied the waters,” Rear Adm. Crandall said, but also admitted that the severity of Clinton’s crimes paralleled her mother’s.  For nine days JAG’s brightest legal minds pondered Clinton’s fate, ultimately concluding that Chelsea Clinton would indeed be hanged. “Chelsea Clinton’s crimes, on which she has been convicted, and wanton disregard for child safety and welfare leave us no choice but to support a death penalty. Her lack of remorse at her tribunal leads us to believe that lifelong imprisonment will not benefit her,” they wrote in a memorandum.  Upon learning her fate, Clinton collapsed in a tearful fit.  “You can’t hang me, I’m a mother, what about my children. They’ll be left motherless,” Clinton said to Rear Adm. Crandall.  “I guess you should have thought of that before you ruined the lives of thousands of mothers and children,” Rear Adm. Crandall snapped.  “Why don’t you hang Marc instead? Why aren’t you hanging him?” Clinton asked.  “He cooperated with us,” Rear Adm. Crandall replied.  “I’m so, so sorry. It was my mother and Bill. They forced me—” Clinton started, but Rear Adm. Crandall interrupted her.  “–You’re not very adroit at faking emotion. You hang tomorrow.”  And on the morning of November 6, Chelsea Clinton’s neck snapped, ending over 30 years of Clinton carnage.  RRN did not feel it necessary to spell out the details of the actual hanging as they were remarkably like those of other Deep State agents whose lives ended at the gallows.

341,200591812085250448660444496687022553504,"Pilots of Southwest Airlines and other major U.S. carriers have good reason for resisting vaccination mandates. Their fellow pilots who had taken the controversial Covid-19 vaccine have been dropping dead on both domestic and international flights.  Two weeks ago, Dr. Jane Ruby claimed on the Stew Peters Show that a Delta Airlines pilot died inflight, shortly after the pilot had received a second dose of the Covid-19 vaccination. The mainstream media, Delta, and the so-called fact-checking agencies quickly dismissed the claim, calling it false and unsubstantiated—mainly because the claimant did not supply the name of the pilot, the flight number, or the points of origin and destination for the flight.  Nonetheless, Real Raw News felt the issue deserved further investigation. Although we cannot authenticate Dr. Ruby’s specific incident, we learned that at least two freshly vaccinated pilots had dropped dead midflight within weeks of having received a Covid-19 vaccination.  An FAA whistleblower speaking under condition of anonymity told RRN that the Biden administration, the FAA, and the airlines are covering up the incidents because the airlines need ticket sales and because the administration wants to maintain the illusion that Covid-19 vaccines are safe and effective.  According to him, two American Airline pilots in 14 days have perished in the cockpit.  On October 15, American Airlines Flight 2740, an Airbus A320, was enroute from Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport to Fort Meyers (RSW) when the unthinkable happened. As the plane began a gradual decent toward southwest Florida, the pilot in command (PIC) began convulsing and had a cardiac arrest. Fortunately, the aircraft was still on autopilot, giving the co-pilot time to evaluate the situation, unharness himself, pull the PIC from his seat and try to administer CPR. But his efforts were in vain.  The co-pilot returned to his seat and squawked 7700, the international transponder code for “I have an emergency.” The plane landed safely, but the co-pilot was put on administrative leave for having left his seat and endangering the aircraft, our source said.  “It was later determined that the PIC had a fatal heart attack caused by myocarditis, a known side effect of the Covid-19 vaccinations. He had received his second dose of the vaccine two weeks before that flight. His last full physical was three months prior, and his doctor had given him a clean bill of health,” our source said.  The second fatality took place a week later, and it, too was a DFW departure. American Airlines Flight 971, an Airbus A321, departed DFW for LAX at 8:00 a.m. Midway through the flight, the co-pilot complained he had chest pains but chalked it up to having eaten a spicy meal before departure. He told the PIC it was indigestion. As the plane flew at 32,000 ft. over the New Mexico/Arizona state line, the co-pilot started convulsing and vomiting on the flight controls. At that point, the PIC contacted Air Traffic Control, requesting permission to swing around and make an emergency landing in Albuquerque, NM, but ATC, after apparently consulting American Airlines, denied the request and compelled the PIC to complete the flight to LAX.  The co-pilot died in his chair, also from acute myocarditis. He had gotten his second vaccination—Pfizer—21 days ahead of that fateful flight.  “The PIC was put under a gag order and told not to discuss the incident with anyone under threat of losing his job,” our source said. “There is a systematic effort going on right now to prevent the public from knowing about pilots getting very ill or very dead in the air. The airlines don’t want to lose money, and the administration doesn’t want the public to know the true dangers of the vaccine. I know for fact that Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg ordered the airlines to classify incidents involving pilot deaths.”  In closing, he added that he is aware of at least 12 non-fatal incidents involving pilots that had recently taken the jab.

The ‘Covid-19 Vaccine Surveillance Report – Week 43’ was published by the UK Health Security Agency (formerly Public Health England) on Thursday, 28th October 2021 and it shows that the vast majority of Covid-19 hospitalisations between September 27th and October 24th were among the fully vaccinated population.  Table 3 of the report shows that the number of people presenting to emergency care with Covid-19 resulting in overnight inpatient admission who were not-vaccinated was 2,832, whilst a further 305 were partly vaccinated, and 5.124 were fully vaccinated.  Meaning between September 27th and October 24th, 66% of those hospitalised with Covid-19 were vaccinated whilst 34% were not-vaccinated.  However, the above figures unfortunately are not reflected in the number of Covid-19 deaths, because whilst the majority were yet again among the fully vaccinated, the difference between the vaccinated and not-vaccinated was much greater.  Table 4 of the report shows the number of people to have died within 28 days of a positive test result for Covid-19 who were not vaccinated was just 487, whilst a further 88 were partly vaccinated, but a shocking 2,185 were fully vaccinated.  Meaning between September 27th and October 24th, 82.4% of those who died with Covid-19 were vaccinated whilst just 17.6% were not vaccinated.

343,172725204388956939274363167554749497404,"Marc Mezvinsky’s testimony resumed Thursday morning, and his remarks helped slam shut Chelsea Clinton’s proverbial coffin.  Rear Adm. Crandall opened the day by asking Mezvinsky about the 3 Haitian children who were passengers in Chelsea’s rented Mercedes at the time of her arrest.  “They were imported into the country some time ago; I don’t remember exactly when. They were meant to be gifts to a friend of the Clinton foundation,” Mezvinsky said.  “Interesting vernacular you have there. You use the word ‘imported’ as if they were a crate of microchips or lettuce. I think the words ‘abducted’ and ‘smuggled’ are more appropriate, don’t you? Who was this friend?” Rear Adm. Crandall asked.  Mezvinsky said he did not know. He claimed that he was to wait in the vehicle while Chelsea escorted the children to a hotel room in Rockport, Massachusetts. He also denied knowledge of the youngsters’ names, for Chelsea, like her mother, indecipherably scrambled proper names into anagrams to thwart attempts to track down smuggled children.  “Was it common for you and the defendant to personally deliver smuggled kids into the hands of pedophiles? You’re both high-profile people. Isn’t that a bit…risky and stupid?”  “It was rare, and she told me it was a special delivery. Besides, we had a get out of jail free card, like in the monopoly game,” Mezvinsky said.  “Get out of jail free card? Could you expand on that?” asked Rear Adm. Crandall.  “Say, for example, we got puled over by a state trooper, or even the feds, for whatever reason. They’d make one phone call and be told they’d have to release us, no questions asked,” Mezvinsky said.  “Are you suggesting, Mr. Mezvinsky, that local law enforcement and the intelligence agencies are subservient to the Clintons?” Rear Adm. Crandall asked.  “Absolutely,” Mezvinsky replied.  “It seems the Delta Force operators who arrested you didn’t honor that get out of jail free card you had,” Rear Adm. Crandall said.  “That was—unexpected,” Mezvinsky admitted.  Rear Adm. Crandall wanted to know if Hillary Chelsea Clinton knew the names of the thousands of children she and her family had sold to pedophiles, and the identities of the recipients.  “She does,” Mezvinsky said.  His admission caused Chelsea to launch into an inexorable rant against Mezvinsky, calling him a “spineless, sorry excuse of man, no backbone, no balls, piss-poor excuse of a husband. You keep your fucking mouth shut, that’s what you do, Marc.” Her outburst, Rear Adm. Crandall said, denoted a blatant contempt of courtroom civility, and he cautioned her to respect the court under threat of being gagged for the rest of the trial.  “During your testimony on Tuesday, Mr. Mezvinsky, you stated you were responsible for destroying evidence of Clinton crimes. But that’s not entirely true, is it? In your deposition, you told JAG you had screenshotted spreadsheets containing thousands of, how shall I put this, anagrammed names of both smuggled children and their intended recipients, including dollar amounts they were to be sold for. Is that correct?” Rear Adm. Crandall asked.  Mezvinsky nodded, saying he need “an insurance policy” against Clinton retaliation, in case they turned on him.  Rear Adm. Crandall approached the 3 officers tasked with judging the military’s evidence on Clinton. He laid on the table a ream of paper, saying the documents, regardless of muddled names, conclusively proved that Chelsea Clinton had authorized the selling of children who had been smuggled into the United States from countries such as Haiti, Columbia, and the Ukraine.  One recipient’s anagram–Tindus Komsovitz—appeared 11 times. Rear Adm. Crandall told the tribunal that U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command at Ft. Meade had rigorously scrutinized the database and deduced that “Tindus Komsovitz” was really Facebook Co-Founder Dustin Moskovitz, a longtime friend of the Clintons who had donated millions of dollars to Hillary Clinton’s election campaigns.  “I ask you, directly, Mr. Mezvinsky—did you and Chelsea Clinton sell children to Dustin Moskovitz?”  Rivulets of tears streamed down Mezvinsky’s face. “I’m sorry, yes, him and so, so many others.”  “And you’ll provide us the names you—” Rear Adm. Crandall started, but Chelsea rose to her feet and again lambasted her husband.  “You’ll keep your fucking mouth shut,” Clinton blurted, her voice a witch’s cackle.  Per Rear Adm. Crandall’s instructions, a pair of Marines gagged Clinton and dragged her from the chamber.  Rear Adm. Crandall asked the panel whether it had heard enough, and the officers unanimously found Chelsea Clinton guilty of all charges and recommended she be executed for crimes against humanity and for destroying the lives of countless families. Rear Adm. Crandall, however, admitted to quandary—could the U.S. military execute Clinton given the absence of evidence that she was guilty of murdering an American citizen or committing treason as stipulated under the Insurrection Act of 1812, the U.S. Constitution, or the Patriot Act.  Sentencing, Rear Adm. Crandall said, would commence “in days.”  “She will either be hanged or spend life at GITMO,” Rear Adm. Crandall said.

344,235514304645081986015645670958949722683,"U.S. Special Forces arrested former President George W. Bush Saturday morning at his Crawford, Texas, ranch following a blistering firefight with Secret Service agents and private security contractors assigned to protect him.  On Friday evening, a Special Forces “Alpha Detachment” stationed at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, received from U.S. Army Special Operations Command orders to infiltrate the ranch and arrest the 43rd president. SF were told to expect resistance because recent intelligence on the ranch showed that Bush had surrounded himself with armed private security contractors in addition to the trio of Secret Service agents that routinely patrolled the grounds.  Transportation to the ranch was provided by the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, nicknamed Night Stalkers, a group of highly skilled chopper pilots that conduct transport, attack, assault, and reconnaissance missions, at night, at low altitude, and on short notice. The choppers had to make 3 refueling stops to reach their destination.  Under cover of darkness early Saturday morning, the choppers descended into a clearing near the southeast corner of Bush’s 1,600-acre ranch, far from the staff trailers and the main house where they hoped to find Bush sleeping. After offloading SF, the choppers ascended into the night to await a call for exfiltration.  A military source familiar with the mission told Real Raw News that Special Operations Command had obtained detailed satellite imagery of the property as well as locations of trail cams that live-streamed to a communications bunker 100 yards from the main building.  “Intelligence estimated that Bush had 20 security contractors and 3 Secret Service on the property. The plan was to exploit blind spots in the surveillance cameras, ingress to the main building, subdue Bush’s personal guards, and drag him to the exfil point without alerting the larger security force. But something went horribly wrong,” our source said.  Special Forces had approached to within 200 yards of the main house when all hell broke loose.  Two open-top ATVs, each with a driver and 3 security personnel, sped out of the darkness and toward the encroaching SF unit, the headlights momentarily illuminating the soldiers as they separated into groups and dove for cover. Bush’s security unleashed a hailstorm of suppressive fire, wounding one soldier and killing another. While one SF group engaged the enemy, the other dashed toward the main house, hoping to capture Bush before he could be evacuated on his own private helicopter, which sat parked near the main structure.  “The battle turned in our favor quickly. SF took cover behind a rock wall and with the aid of NVGs shot out the tires on both vehicles and then killed or grievously wounded Bush’s security. But they knew there was still at least a dozen patrolling the property and they would’ve been alerted and on their way. Time was of the essence,” our source said.  The second SF unit reached the main house just as 2 Secret Service agents emerged and began steering Bush, still in his pajamas, to an armored limousine parked alongside dense shrubbery. SF instructed them to halt and throw up their hands, but the agents wheeled around and drew weapons, only to be killed a second later.  Somewhere on the property a deafening klaxon blared like an air raid siren.  “They gagged and bagged Bush, then regrouped. They couldn’t make the exfil point, not with one KIA and a teammate with a sucking chest wound. They radioed for pickup where they stood. A pilot told them that enemy forces were mobilizing near the staff trailers, and they had only minutes to get out of there. The birds weren’t armed for combat; otherwise, they could’ve hosed down those trailers,” our source said.  The choppers touched down only long enough to retrieve SF and their package, avoiding further conflict.  Our source said that JAG and the Office of Military Commissions had long sought Bush’s arrest. He did not say why it waited so long or why it felt such an impetus to grab Bush Saturday morning. Bush, he said, has been charged with treason and is being held to account for the deaths of thousands of soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan and for his role in masterminding 9/11, in addition to other crimes.  “He will face a military tribunal,” our source said.

TRENDING: Alec Baldwin's Negligent Discharge - Actor May Face Involuntary Manslaughter Charges  These events in Wisconsin on November 4th were neither random nor independent.  They were intentional fraud used to steal the election.  President Trump knows this as well as most of America. In May President Trump shared this message:  At 6:31 in the morning on November 4th, a dump of 149,772 votes came in to the State of Michigan. Biden received 96% of those votes and the State miraculously went to him. Has the Michigan State Senate started their review of the Fraudulent Presidential Election of 2020 yet, or are they about to start? If not, they should be run out of office. Likewise, at 3:42 in the morning, a dump of 143,379 votes came in to the state of Wisconsin, also miraculously, given to Biden. Where did these “votes” come from? Both were State Election changing events, and that is on top of the other corruption without even including the fact that neither state got Legislative approval, which is required under the United States Constitution.  Also, note something that we called HORSESH*T the day after the election. The state of Wisconsin have an 89% turnout in the election.  Umm. That didn’t happen.  This ratio was impossible as well and indicated likely fraud.  Why doesn’t Speaker Vos want to look into this?  Note: This post was updated to share more data on the still unprecedented vote spikes for Joe Biden on Election night and to correct numbers in Wisconsin.",Wisconsin Had 89% Reported Turnout in 2020 Election — Impossible Number that Still Can’t Be Explained,false

At 3:00 a.m., Delta Force cut the lock on a barbwire fence that protected an 8,500-square-foot warehouse just south of Pier 33 near San Francisco Bay. Equipped with innovative weaponry and night vision goggles, the operators pushed toward the warehouse and, after failing to cut through a reinforced lock on the warehouse door, blew open the door using a shaped C-4 charge. They hurled flashbang grenades into the warehouse, stunning two chemists who had been hovering over an assortment of beakers and vials.  They subdued the chemists with zip ties, and then made a shocking discovery—15 industrial freezers brimming with bags of chilled Adrenochrome, 600 liters in all.  Delta Force also found 100 bags of whole blood in a locked refrigerator.  Each bag was dated with an indelible marker, ostensibly reflecting the date it was filled. The most recent inscribed date was October 16, two before the raid.  One Delta Force operator described the scene as a “macabre mad science lab with beakers and test tubes and other chemistry gear covering several stainless-steel tables.”  Our source said Delta confiscated everything in the laboratory and transported the items to an unknown location for destruction.  “We took what we need for evidence; the rest has been destroyed. There’s going to be a lot of unhappy elitists out there looking for their Adrenochrome injections or infusions. It’s likely this was just one of many clandestine storage units and labs,” our source said.  Asked whether the military had been tipped off by a Deep State official, like the ones who had been tried and executed at Guantanamo Bay, he said the following: “No. I’m sure if criminals such as Hillary or Podesta knew the locations of these places, the stuff would have been moved immediately following their capture. None of them shared info on Adrenochrome storage. This location was not a mobile lab, it was fixed, and they’d been there quite a while.”  (Visited 36,983 times, 4,857 visits today)",Delta Force Raids Adrenochrome Warehouse,false
349,121268374887383727433159139174825700652,"Latest UK PHE Vaccine Surveillance Report figures on Covid cases show that doubly vaccinated 40-70 year olds have lost 40% of their immune system capability compared to unvaccinated people. Their immune systems are deteriorating at around 5% per week (between 2.7% and 8.7%). If this continues then 30-50 year olds will have 100% immune system degradation, zero viral defence by Christmas and all doubly vaccinated people over 30 will have lost their immune systems by March next year.  By a concerned reader  The 5 PHE tables below from their excellent Vaccine Surveillance Report, separated by 4 weeks, clearly show the progressive damage that the vaccines are doing to the immune system’s response.    People aged 40-69 have already lost 40% of their immune system capability and are losing it progressively at 3.3% to 6.4% per week.  Weekly Decline in doubly vaccinated immune system performance compared to unvaccinated people…  Everybody over 30 will have lost 100% of their entire immune capability (for viruses and certain cancers) within 6 months.  30-50 year olds will have lost it by Christmas. These people will then effectively have full blown acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and destroy the NHS.    The vaccine booster shots have to be the same as the vaccines themselves, because it takes forever to do clinical trials and get approval for something different. So if you take a booster shot, these figures show that you are giving yourself an even faster progressive form of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (after a couple of months of effectiveness).

The figures above indicate that their figures may well have been correct immediately after vaccination (the younger age groups have had the vaccine for the shortest time).

However, all health ministers FAILED to come up with the evidence because the virus DOES NOT EXIST.  The Spanish health minister didn't even attend the hearing. Instead, the minister sent a letter explaining that NO EVIDENCE for the virus's existence can be found.  It's easy to understand why no politician can ever show the proof: COVID-19 was PATENTED years ago after being manufactured in a lab.  In other words, COVID-19 is a BIOWEAPON. That breaks global biological weapon treaties and the Nuremberg Code.  Any government official who shows evidence that the virus was patented years ago will ADMIT that GENOCIDE is occurring worldwide.

351,23449566086561061454458153938563580429,"The disreputable, faux Biden administration and its media cohorts have perpetrated yet another fallacy on the American public by claiming that Colin Powell died of “Covid-19 complications” despite being fully vaccinated. Although breakthrough infections that result in death are becoming more common and broadly reported by alternative media, Colin Powell had never received a positive Covid-19 diagnosis or displayed symptoms commonly associated with the China virus, said an administration whistleblower speaking under promise of anonymity.  The administration and the media have released scant details on his death, obfuscating both where he died and the approximate time of death, but were quick to blame his demise on Covid-19.  Powell, who had suffered from multiple myeloma, a blood cancer, committed suicide early Monday morning, our source said.  “Powell died at home after consuming a bottle of prescription sleeping pills,” he said.  According to him, Powell’s wife Alma awoke at 3:00 a.m. and noticed that her husband was not breathing. She discovered an empty bottle of Ambien, which had been nearly full the night previous, tucked amid the bedsheets.  “Alma called 911. She said the bottle was almost full because Colin had filled it only a few days ago. 911 routed the Call directly to the White House, which has never been heard of. No paramedics, no ambulances showed up at his McClean, Virginia, home—only the FBI,” our source said.  Two FBI Special Agents and an agency forensic pathologist arrived at the Powell’s residence shortly after 4:00 a.m. They found Mrs. Powell in a state of hysteria, screaming and crying at the top her lungs as she hovered over late husband’s corpse. After a thorough examination of the bedroom, one agent found what appeared to be a suicide note on the floor beside the Powell’s bed.  “I’ll love you always, Alma, you and the children. But I am old and sick, and I know they’ll find me soon, like they have the others. I don’t want my legacy to end that way. I pray you can all forgive me, for what I’ve done, and now what I no longer have to do. The man in the glass tower must not rise. I place myself in the Lord’s hands; I’d rather He judge me than them,” part of the note purportedly read.  Powell, who had identified as a Republican, was a RINO—Republican in name only. He was an outspoken opponent of Donald J. Trump, and he had endorsed both Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden’s bids for the presidency.  “The FBI made a call directly to Kamala Harris, and she told them they’d have to spin the death to make it appear as if he died from Covid,” our source said. “The FBI is a tool of the Deep State.”  The administration and the CDC have been instructing health institutions and city and county coroners to falsify death certificates to make it seem as if every human fatality over the last two years was a result of Covid-19.

Just got this:  Has not been in the news anywhere. Looks like we are getting closer to the Final Scene in the movie.  Please ALERT everyone in the family, friends and relatives! BREAKING NEWS ! Supreme Court has canceled universal vaccination In the United States, the Supreme Court has canceled universal vaccination. Bill Gates, US Chief Infectious Disease Specialist Fauci, and Big Pharma have lost a lawsuit in the US Supreme Court, failing to prove that all of their vaccines over the past 32 years have been safe for the health of citizens!  The lawsuit was filed by a group of scientists led by Senator Kennedy. Robert F. Kennedy Jr .: “The new COVID vaccine should be avoided at all costs. I urgently draw your attention to important issues related to the next vaccination against Covid-19. For the first time in the history of vaccination, the so-called mRNA vaccines of the latest generation directly interfere with the patient’s genetic material and therefore alter the individual genetic material, which is genetic manipulation, which was already prohibited and was previously considered a crime.  The coronavirus VACCINE IS NOT A VACCINE! ATTENTION!  What has always been a vaccine? It was always the pathogen itself – a microbe or virus that was killed or attenuated, that is, weakened – and it was introduced into the body in order to produce antibodies. Not even a coronavirus vaccine! It is not that at all! It is part of the newest group of mRNA (mRNA) allegedly “vaccines”. Once inside a human cell, mRNA reprograms normal RNA / DNA, which begins to make another protein.  That is, nothing to do with traditional vaccines! That is, it is an instrument of genetic influence. Genetic bioweapon! That is, they were going to destroy from earthlings, and the survivors will become GMOs! Following the unprecedented mRNA vaccine, the vaccinated will no longer be able to treat the symptoms of the vaccine in an additional way.  Vaccinated people will have to come to terms with the consequences, because they can no longer be cured by simply removing toxins from the human body, as in a person with a genetic defect such as Down syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, Turner syndrome, genetic heart failure, hemophilia, cystic fibrosis, Rett syndrome, etc. ), because the genetic defect is forever!  This clearly means: if a symptom of vaccination develops after mRNA vaccination, neither I nor any other therapist can help you, because DAMAGE CAUSED BY VACCINATION WILL BE GENETICALLY Irreversible.  Vaccination – Bio-weapons of genocide of the 21st century. Former Pfizer Chief Scientist Mike Yeedon has once again expressed his position that it is too late now to save those who have been injected with a substance publicly called “the Covid-19 vaccine.” He encourages those who have not yet received the lethal injection to fight for their lives, those around them and the lives of their children.  The internationally renowned immunologist goes on to describe a process that he says will kill the vast majority of people: “Immediately after the first vaccination, about 0.8% of people die within two weeks. The average life expectancy of survivors will be a maximum of two years, but it also decreases with each new “injection”.  ” Additional vaccines are still being developed to cause deterioration in certain organs, including the heart, lungs and brain. After two decades at Pfizer, Professor Yedon was familiar with the functions and research and development goals of pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, and states that the ultimate goal of the current “vaccination” regime can only be a massive demographic event that will make all world wars put together, like Mickey’s staging Mouse.  “Billions of people have already been sentenced to certain, inevitable and painful death. Anyone who receives the injection will die prematurely, and three years is a generous estimate of how long they can survive.”  We are on.

354,179957134392077596255234245184138900731,"On Monday afternoon, former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo learned his fate, having been held responsible for the needless deaths of thousands of senior citizens who perished during the first wave of a largely manufactured global plandemic. He was sentenced to death after a 3-officer panel at Guantanamo Bay heard testimony from former members of Cuomo’s staff, nursing home and hospice employees, and the worker of a freight company who claimed Cuomo had threatened to bankrupt the company unless it converted 18-wheelers into a fleet of roving freezers and crematoriums.  From the moment he entered the courtroom, Cuomo was combative, belligerent, and argumentative, hurling obscenities at both Rear Adm. Darse E. Crandall and the panel chosen to weigh the merits of the military’s case against him. He admonished the Office of Military Commissions, calling it an affront to the criminal justice system and the “American way of life.”  “Never in my gubernatorial career or my years as a lawyer have I seen such a fucking miscarriage of justice. You people are really pieces of shit,” Cuomo said during a brief opening statement.  The brevity of his argument was not by choice. Had he the chance, Cuomo would have castigated the court until his voice went hoarse. But Rear Adm. Crandall quickly put an end to Cuomo’s theatrics and shenanigans by instructing GITMO security to gag his mouth and shackle his ankles to a chair.  “We have zero tolerance for staginess and theatricality in this chamber,” Rear Adm. Crandall said. “The witnesses will be heard.”  The first witness to appear on ZOOM was a woman named Michelle Steiger, a former administrator at the Cobble Hill Health Center in Brooklyn. She testified that on March 26, 2020, the facility received a sudden influx of alleged Covid-19 patients, 65 in all, from area hospitals, even though the senior living facility had enough beds to accommodate less than half that amount.  Ms. Steiger: We were told the patients had Covid-19 and ordered to take them into our facility  Rear Adm. Crandall: Ordered how?  Ms. Steiger: We received documents signed by Andrew Cuomo and the health commissioner, Howard Zucker, saying that they’d pull state funding unless we accepted all Covid-19 patients sent to us. Few of our existing patients had tested positive, and of the first 65 they sent us, only 7 were positive for Covid-19. But we were told to say they all had Covid-19, because we’d be better financially compensated, even in the absence of a positive PCR test. We were told to falsify medical records, to say people who didn’t have Covid-19 had it. And to expect a new group of patients every week.  Rear Adm. Crandall: But Cobble Hill Health had no room for that many more patients?  Ms. Steiger: That’s correct. In another correspondence, we were told not to worry about that because a pickup was to be arranged each week to remove existing Covid patients and replace them with new ones.  Rear Adm. Crandall: Replace them? Had they died—of Covid-19?  Ms. Steiger: I’m unaware of any patient dying from or with Covid-19. In our environment, people die, yes, of heart attacks and non-Covid respiratory ailments. But we were told to code all deaths as Covid fatalities.  Rear Adm. Crandall: I see. Certainly not all patients in your ward suddenly dropped dead. What happened to the ones who were alive to make room for new patients the hospitals sent to you?  Ms. Steiger: For the live ones, trucks, like the ones that haul frozen goods across the country, arrived every other week or so, and the patients were taken and placed in the trucks. I don’t know where they went or what happened after that, but these were old and frail people, and there’s no way they survived long in refrigerated trucks.  Rear Adm. Crandall: And the patients who had expired, for whatever reason.  Ms. Steiger: Different kinds of trucks, fitted with furnaces. The bodies were hurled into them.  Rear Adm. Crandall: Didn’t you realize the criminality of your actions and participation, Ms. Steiger?”  Ms. Steiger: Of course. But I—we—were afraid, afraid of losing our jobs and of other things. One staff member who threatened to go to the press was told CPS would take her children if she didn’t keep quiet and follow instructions.  Rear Adm. Crandall: One last question. Why transport people from hospitals to nursing homes at all? Why wouldn’t he just have had these alleged Covid patients picked up at the hospitals?  Ms. Steiger: I could only speculate.  Rear Adm. Crandall: The tribunal will indulge your speculation given that you’ve spent 25 years working in the facilities, but the officers are instructed to not consider your statement as evidence.  Ms. Steiger: Hospitals are enormous institutions with thousands of people, most of them pretty healthy. If someone did have Covid, there’d be a risk of the infection spreading across all the staff and patients. Hospital acquired infection is a leading cause of death in hospitals. The infirmed at nursing homes are very old and very sick and don’t have much life left in them. I guess it was no big deal if they died.”  Rear Adm. Crandall: Finally, did you receive any compensation for going along with this agenda?  Ms. Steiger: I did not.  Rear Adm. Crandall excused the witness and slid documents onto the table behind which the 3-officer panel was seated. The papers bore the signatures of Andrew Cuomo and Howard Zucker. One, which Cuomo had sent to 8 nursing homes in lower New York State, instructed staff to “assume patients were Covid-19 positive regardless of test results if they exhibited even a single symptom of the illness,” such as coughing, sneezing, wheezing, or shortness of breath.  “We cannot jeopardize the health of the general population. All patients exhibiting symptoms of Covid-19 should presumptively be considered to have it unless directed otherwise by New York State Health and Human Services,” Cuomo or Zucker had written.  After a brief recess, Rear Adm. Crandall introduced the next witness, Marco Miranda, a former driver for Brooklyn-based freight carrier BZC. He said he had been employed with BZC for 15 years and had spent most of that time hauling produce between the United States in Canada. In March of 2020, however, the company had given him new instructions.  Rear Adm Crandall: Mr. Miranda, in your deposition you said you were one of several drivers who picked up patients at Cobble Hill Health Center, is that correct?  Mr. Miranda: Cobble Hill and other places.  Rear Adm. Crandall: And that operating on instructions given by BZC, you moved patients from those facilities into refrigerated tract—”  Mr. Miranda: I didn’t move nobody. The staff at those places moved them and put’em in the truck. Me and my partner just did the driving, that’s all.”  Rear Adm. Crandall: But you can confirm they were alive when placed in the vehicle?”  Mr. Miranda: Oh, yeah, they were breathing all right. Some of them even flailed their arms and the nursing home people sedated them for transport.  Rear Adm. Crandall: How were they stored?  Mr. Miranda: Bunks, cots, 3-high were installed on either side of the trailer. They were put there and strapped down.  Rear Adm. Crandall: What is the temperature inside a refrigerated trailer?  Mr. Miranda: Oh, it’s like your fridge at home, we can dial up or dial down the temp, anywhere from 65 to -20 Fahrenheit. We were told to bottom out the thermostat.  Rear Adm. Crandall: Did you know that the persons inside, who were alive, would not survive long in those temperatures?  Mr. Miranda: Wasn’t my business. I did what I was told. Look, man, you didn’t cross the Cuomo brothers—if you did, bad shit would happen to you and your family. I have a wife and 3 kids to think about.  Rear Adm. Crandall: So you’re saying with certitude that Cuomo was behind the orders?  Mr. Miranda: We knew who was calling the shots.  Rear Adm. Crandall: Where were the patients taken?  Mr. Miranda: There was a mass grave site dug on Hart Island. We drove to City Island, and people was waiting to unload the bodies and put’em on a ferry to Hart. I never touched a single one of them. All I did was drive.  Rear Adm. Crandall: In your deposition, you said you saw Cuomo at the unloading site, is that correct?  Mr. Miranda. I saw the bastard. Even snapped a pic on my phone.  Rear Adm. Crandall entered into evidence a photograph of Andrew Cuomo standing beside six men in HAZMAT suits who were unloading frozen corpses from the trailer and moving them onto the ferry.  Rear Adm. Crandall: Just a few more questions. Ballpark figure, how many persons did you transport between March and September of 2020.  Mr. Miranda: Thousands. And we wasn’t the only one. We had five trucks going all the time.  Rear Adm. Crandall: And were you promised anything in return for your testimony today?  Mr. Miranda: No. I know what we did was wrong. But we were scared. Like I said, you don’t fuck with the Cuomo brothers. I just pray God forgives me.  The last witness to appear was none other than Melissa DeRosa, who had been Cuomo’s principal ally, aide, and mouthpiece. She resigned her position after many women accused the former governor of sexual harassment. She provided to the Office of Military Commissions countless papers and electronic files that corroborated the testimony of earlier witnesses.  Rear Adm. Crandall: Mrs. DeRosa, we know you’re reluctant to speak here today, but can you say as fact that your former employer, Andrew Cuomo, seated before us here today, did indeed profit from the actions he’s alleged to have taken and that he did so to foster an agenda—that agenda being to artificially amplify the threat Covid-19?  Mrs. DeRosa: Yes, I can testify to that. The documents I’ve provided spell it all out.  Rear Adm. Crandall: And do you know as fact that Andrew Cuomo is responsible for the murders of thousands of senior citizens who might otherwise be alive today were it not for his actions?  Mrs. DeRosa: Tens of thousands.  Rear Adm. Crandall: Were you afraid of Cuomo?  Mrs. DeRosa: Terrified.  After excusing the witness, Rear Adm. Crandall instructed the tribunal to carefully read the documents and to thoroughly consider the testimony it had heard. The panel sequestered itself in an antechamber and deliberated for three hours before returning a verdict of guilty on all counts, recommending that Andrew Cuomo be hanged for his crimes.  An execution date is pending.  (Visited 10 times, 10 visits today)",Military Convicts Andrew Cuomo,false

It only took Spotify, the world’s largest streaming service for music and podcasts, a few days to cancel his contract.  “Like most highly paid performers for Spotify, Joe Rogan had a morality clause in the agreement,” Spotify CEO Andrew Canard said. “It’s clear he broke it when he engaged in such irresponsible and dangerous behavior.

358,41183519597099367587643767554879484366,"President Joe Biden has ordered the Department of Veterans Affairs to withhold healthcare benefits from unvaccinated veterans as part of an aggressive new initiative to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.  Beginning November 1, any veteran seeking medical care at a VA facility must have had at least one shot of the vaccine to receive services under their medical benefits package.  The executive order is one of several new rules to combat the Delta variant, including vaccine requirements for federal workers, large employers, and health care staff.  In a televised speech Thursday evening, the president called upon veterans to continue their service to the United States, saying their debt to the country must be paid in perpetuity.  “As with so many other things in our country, veterans are part of the problem when they should be part of the solution. We promised to take care of you in return for your service to this country. You promised us your life. Now it’s time to help us protect you before we let you die some other way because you failed to avoid dying a way we didn’t want you to. If this doesn’t make sense to you, have a little faith. There is great honor in doing what you’re told,” Biden said.  “You are willing to fight and die for your country. You are willing to take a bullet in the head for next to nothing. Get blown to bits over in Afghanistan. But you won’t let us pump some mRNA molecules into your arm?” the president continued. “It’s time to get real. Some of you are behaving like some real wise guys here, some real dummies. Wiseguy dumb-dumb boys, as my father used to say. Enough is enough. So sit down and get the dang shot. Do what we tell you to do and continue your service to this great country. Or go without your healthcare benefits. The choice is yours.”  There are around 19 million U.S. veterans that will be affected by the order. VA officials have said that roughly 10% of veterans have indicated they are “not interested” in getting the shots. Nearly 50% remained unvaccinated as of July when the department’s most recent data was released.  Asked how strict the VA would be in applying the rules with veterans facing more acute health crises, the president said it would be a zero-tolerance policy.  “There will be no exceptions to this policy,” Biden said. “If you walk into a VA hospital for cancer treatment and aren’t vaccinated, the shot will go up your behind before you start chemo. It’s that simple. Protect yourself and others from COVID-19, or we’ll stop protecting you from everything else. Comprende, negranos?”  Veterans blasted the president’s decision.  “It should go without saying that this order makes no sense whatsoever,” said VFW spokesperson Tommy Fitzhugh. “This administration is jeopardizing the health of American veterans by claiming to have an interest in their health and wellbeing. Joe Biden is out of his mind.”  “I just don’t trust the government, especially after my experience in the service and watching how they handle business and care for the people they’re supposed to represent,” said U.S. Army veteran and Ohio resident John Bigolballs. “We just witnessed a complete debacle in Afghanistan where 13 American service members died because of our incompetent and hasty withdrawal. Why did I even fight over there again? Nothing is what it seems. They’ll let me drink myself to death, drive myself crazy with PTSD, live on the street, but COVID-19 is the end of the world all of a sudden? Things never quite add up. It doesn’t seem fair not to have a choice under the circumstances.”  Some were ready for it to all be over.  “I am homeless and do not care whether I live or die,” said former Marine Tony Franks, aka Tony Who Gives a Fuck About Any Of This Shit. “The only shot I want is one to the head.”  Asked to respond to veterans’ concerns, a White House spokesperson echoed the president’s views.  “We are no longer fighting wars overseas. We are fighting a war right here at home against the stupidity of the American people,” the spokesperson said. “People die every day from myriad causes, but dying of COVID-19 when there is a vaccine available is unacceptable. Suicide, drug overdoses, homicides, fatal accidents — these are all tragedies, too, but we can deal with them — COVID-19 deaths aren’t something we will tolerate.

359,8763192251642145113254139436880519338,"Arthur Roberts, the 83-year-old C-List actor who portrays Joseph Biden on television and in person, blew his cover during a televised press conference with UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson earlier this week. In a stunning scene seen by many, Biden’s (RRN uses the term ‘Biden’ to stand for either Biden or his body doubles) handlers abruptly and seemingly without cause ushered the press pool from the White House Briefing Room while Johnson tried to field questions from British journalists in attendance.  The stunned press pool protested as security forcibly ejected them, clueless as to why they, the administration’s MSM allies, were being rudely told to leave.  On Wednesday, Jen Psaki, who is currently under military investigation, said the room was cleared because Johnson’s questions were not preapproved, but a whistleblower in the fake administration’s communications office revealed to RRN what actually transpired during the surreal briefing.  As reported previously, it is RRN’s contention that the real Joseph R. Biden has not been seen in public since shortly after the 2020 presidential election. The reason is that, in early February, he suffered a massive stroke that left him brain dead and hospitalized at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where he has lain comatose ever since. Biden’s Deep State handlers had had high hopes for Kamala Harris, and had intended that she would succeed him, but it soon became apparent that she lacked fortitude and the mental acuity needed to coalesce the liberal base. Much to her chagrin, she was put on the backburner while the Deep State sought body double replacements who could play a convincing Joe Biden.  One such find was Arthur Roberts, an obscure 80s actor whose capstone cinematic achievement was playing the evil ninja, Braden, in the 1984 martial arts flick Revenge of the Ninja. After that, he faded into obscurity, henceforth obtaining only minor roles in film and television productions, until the Deep State grabbed him as a potential Biden replacement in early March.  Roberts, no spring chicken himself and older than the genuine Biden, apparently has a touch of dementia, which caused him to veer off script and raise suspicion in the eyes of Boris Johnson.  In a moment not caught on microphone and spoken softly enough for the press pool to not overhear, Roberts began lamenting to Johnson his failed film career, and he asked the UK Prime Minister whether he had seen the films Little Miss Magic and Up in Smoke, in which he had minor roles.  A theatrically masked Boris Johnson, our source said, discretely muted his microphone and spoke softly in Roberts’ direction, asking, “You’re not Joe Biden. Who the bloody hell are you?”  “Even though he muted his mic, Jen Psaki and White House Communications Director Kate Bedingfield were in another office, and able to overhear the entire discourse through hidden parabolic mics in the briefing room. They, how should I put this, freaked the fuck out. They began screaming into Roberts’ hidden earpiece to get back on script or read only from the teleprompter. That’s when Roberts silenced his own mic and told Boris he was only joking around. But Psaki feared the situation would deteriorate, and she immediately ordered the room cleared,” our source said.  He added that a bewildered Johnson later asked Psaki “what the hell just happened,” and was told to forget the entire incident, unless the UK wanted to lose all U.S. support.

360,199891407840273220765295979593408465358,"On Saturday morning U.S. Marines from Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, apprehended a Deep State asset whose name laymen may find unfamiliar but who, from the shadows, has influenced the illegal Biden administration’s domestic policy decisions on a grand scale. That person is Anita Dunn, a political strategist who served as Biden’s chief advisor until her resignation on August 12. Although Dunn declined to comment on her reasons, she abruptly quit her position after FOX News unearthed a quote attributed to her; at a 2009 speech to graduating high schoolers, Dunn said Chinese dictator Mao Zedong was one of her “favorite political philosophers,” Moreover, she refused to file the public financial disclosure required of every other presidential appointee.  But Dunn’s departure was in name only. She felt she would wield greater authority and draw less scrutiny operating outside official channels, sentiment shared by her peers—a consortium of vile villains the military aptly refers to as the Biden administration’s “brain trust.” These fastidious fanatics, Dunn among them, have worked arduously to dismantle the U.S. military, defund domestic law enforcement, strengthen the ANTIFA and BLM movements, drive inflation, bankrupt businesses, push vaccination and mask mandates, and embolden foreign adversaries like China.  A JAG source speaking under promise of anonymity told RRN that Dunn had met privately with Deep State Dr. Fauci 7 times since January. At a May meeting Dunn, who has no medical credentials, whimsically suggested to Dr. Fauci that Americans ought to receive quarterly Covid-19 vaccinations, and Fauci, who is an M.D. but has not treated patients since 1977, replied, “Of course it’s a great idea. The more shots we get in arms, the better.”  “I can’t speak to how we obtained recordings of their conversations, but we have them. They had several meets discussing how best to enforce vaccination mandates, and at each meeting they upped the number of shots they thought people should get every year. Dunn’s family has strong ties to the pharmaceutical lobbying industry, and Dr. Fauci has earned enormous profit from vaccine sales. It’s important to remember that Dunn was groomed by Obama. We have her on tape saying that people that die from the vaccine are just collateral damage,” our source said.  Dunn also advocated lockdowns on behalf of the illegitimate administration. In early 2021, she made multiple trips to California, Michigan, and New York to lobby the states’ respective governors to maintain draconian-style lockdowns and bankrupt as many businesses as possible—so the owners would have no choice but to rely on federal assistance, a tenet of Socialism.  “This woman was a major player in the Deep State’s plandemic conspiracy. And even now, as those plandemic plans come crashing down around them, they’re trying to double down and lockdown this country like Australia and Germany. The evidence against Dunn is massive, and it compelled JAG and the OMC to seek her arrest,” our source said.  On Friday, November 19, Rear Adm. David G. Wilson of JAG reached out to Gen. David Berger, commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps, with instructions to “apprehend immediately and discretely Anita Dunn at her Bethesda, Maryland, home.”  It should be noted that Bethesda is a stronghold of Deep State activity, as if the Deep State hierarchy instructs its agents to congregate there for mutual protection. Yet they have been picked off one by one.  Gen. Berger acknowledged the instruction and ordered his subordinates to at once assemble a team to grab Dunn. Early Saturday morning an unknown number of Marines from the 2nd Marine Raider Battalion descended on Dunn’s home. They found Dunn asleep beside her husband Bob Bauer, another Obama stooge, and subdued them with zip ties and duct tape before they could come to their senses and start a fuss.  “The Marines apprehended both out of necessity. They were put in an unmarked vehicle and taken for processing,” our source said, adding that Dunn will most certainly face a military tribunal.  The fate of her husband is not known.

The Defender is experiencing censorship on many social channels. Be sure to stay in touch with the news that matters by subscribing to our top news of the day. It's free.  A groundbreaking preprint paper by the prestigious Oxford University Clinical Research Group, published Aug. 10 in The Lancet, includes alarming findings devastating to the COVID vaccine rollout.  The study found vaccinated individuals carry 251 times the load of COVID-19 viruses in their nostrils compared to the unvaccinated.  While moderating the symptoms of infection, the jab allows vaccinated individuals to carry unusually high viral loads without becoming ill at first, potentially transforming them into presymptomatic superspreaders.  This phenomenon may be the source of the shocking post-vaccination surges in heavily vaccinated populations globally.  The paper’s authors, Chau et al, demonstrated widespread vaccine failure and transmission under tightly controlled circumstances in a hospital lockdown in Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam.  The scientists studied healthcare workers who were unable to leave the hospital for two weeks. The data showed that fully vaccinated workers — about two months after injection with the Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine (AZD1222) — acquired, carried and presumably transmitted the Delta variant to their vaccinated colleagues.  They almost certainly also passed the Delta infection to susceptible unvaccinated people, including their patients. Sequencing of strains confirmed the workers transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to one another.  This is consistent with the observations in the U.S. from Farinholt and colleagues, and congruent with comments by the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conceding COVID-19 vaccines have failed to stop transmission of SARS-CoV-2.  On Feb. 11, the World Health Organization indicated the AZD1222 vaccine efficacy of 63.09% against the development of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. The conclusions of the Chau paper support the warnings by leading medical experts that the partial, non-sterilizing immunity from the three notoriously “leaky” COVID-19 vaccines allow carriage of 251 times the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 as compared to samples from the pre-vaccination era in 2020.  Thus, we have a key piece to the puzzle explaining why the Delta outbreak is so formidable — fully vaccinated are participating as COVID-19 patients and acting as powerful Typhoid Mary-style super-spreaders of the infection.  Vaccinated individuals are blasting out concentrated viral explosions into their communities and fueling new COVID surges. Vaccinated healthcare workers are almost certainly infecting their coworkers and patients, causing horrendous collateral damage.  Continued vaccination will only make this problem worse, particularly among frontline doctors and nurses workers who are caring for vulnerable patients.  Health systems should drop vaccine mandates immediately, take stock of COVID-19 recovered workers who are robustly immune to Delta and consider the ramifications of their current vaccinated healthcare workers as potential threats to high risk patients and coworkers.","Study: Fully Vaccinated Healthcare Workers Carry 251 Times Viral Load, Pose Threat to Unvaccinated Patients, Co-Workers",false

364,148727263868819966123170817979068312222,"Actor Tom Hanks has left the earth, put to death by a military tribunal that found him guilty of pedophilia and child endangerment.  On June 12, the U.S. military apprehended Hanks after a plane he had chartered in Greece, where he held dual citizenship, landed at Malpensa Airport in Milan, Italy, where Hanks had been scheduled to attend a foreign film festival.  U.S. military sources told RRN that members of the 173rd Airborne Combat Brigade and INTERPOL were awaiting Hanks’ arrival when the Learjet 75 reached the airport apron. Weapons drawn, they boarded the plane and found Hanks seated beside longtime friend Peter Scolari, who in 1980 starred alongside Hanks in the TV sitcom Bosom Buddies, in which the duo portrayed transvestites living in an all-female college dormitory. Hanks would later say it was his favorite role, and that wearing women’s clothes made him feel more manly.  The military released Scolari but shackled and promptly ushered Hanks aboard a waiting C-130, which had to be refueled twice inflight to reach Diego Garcia, where the Office of Military Commissions has built a penitentiary near its B2 bomber base. Upon landing, Hanks was placed in a holding cell to await his military tribunal.  Ten days later, Hanks had his day in court, with the U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General’s Corps presenting proof connecting Hanks to a child trafficking ring that, the military alleged, had worked in the shadows for 30 years. It presented into evidence many electronic devices—laptops and cellphones—that held photographs and videos of Hanks engaged in sexual intercourse with male children who were obviously below the age of consent.  Other videos showed Hanks involved in adrenochrome parties, gatherings at which the liberal elite and Hollywood A-listers comingle and inject into themselves an ungodly chemical compound made of oxidized adrenaline, which is extracted from frightened and tortured children, and synthetic opiates. Those who partake in the luciferian ritual believe the compound prevents illness, extends life, and enhances sexual prowess.  One video showed Hanks and songstress Lady GaGa injecting each other while an unseen child’s screams, the wailing sound of death, echoed in the background.  The military’s case was built on 50 video clips and 2,000 images, sources told RRN.  The 3-officer panel, however, found the content so disturbing that it reached a verdict of guilty after watching four snippets.  Hanks, when asked if he had anything to say in his defense, showed no remorse for his crimes and told the tribunal that adult-child intercourse was “natural” and that he proudly supported NAMBLA, the North American Man-Boy Love Association, a pedophilia and pederasty advocacy organization in the United States.  The tribunal declared Hanks receive capital punishment and asked that his sentence be carried out expeditiously.  “My death won’t stop anything; we are everywhere,” Hanks said.  Three days later, Hanks received an injection other than adrenochrome. He was strapped to a gurney and had pancuronium bromide, potassium chloride, and midazolam injected into his veins. If any adrenochrome remained in his blood, it wasn’t potent enough to protect him against lethal injection.  (Visited 196,982 times, 8,110 visits today)",Military Executes Tom Hanks,false
365,230086268386745250670143123404676464367,"The U.S. military on Tuesday arrested Microsoft founder Bill Gates, charging the socially awkward misfit with child trafficking and other unspeakable crimes against America and its people.  Sources within the U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General’s Corps told Real Raw News that the military had spent months trying to find Gates, but the elusive billionaire had used his wealth and Deep State contacts to elude capture, somehow keeping a step ahead of the military’s manhunt.  But on Tuesday, July 27, Gates slipped up, and U.S. Marines were able to apprehend him at a property he secretly owned in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.  The charges against Gates cover a broad spectrum. He purportedly coerced the FDA into issuing emergency authorization on Covid-19 vaccines, knowing that the potentially dangerous pharmaceutical cocktail would not only endanger recipients but also scramble human DNA. JAG is also investigating whether vaccines contain synthetic nanoparticles manufactured by Microsoft and Swedish biotech company Biohax International. The military alleges that Gates stood to profit massively from vaccine sales. Gates, who has previously denied having a financial stake in the vaccines, earned at least $10 billion from the joint sales of the Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson vaccinations, according to JAG documents. JAG is holding Gates partly responsible for the deaths of 7,000 American citizens who died within 72 hours of receiving the drug.  Moreover, the military has charged Gates with masterminding a child trafficking ring, which he ran with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. As reported by RRN on 20 May, U.S. Navy Seals operating under JAG authority stormed Gates’ 492-acre ranch in northwest Wyoming and discovered a subterranean bunker where children had been temporarily housed prior to being sold into slavery. An SD card recovered at the scene showed a young girl in pajamas handcuffed to a bed and crying out for her mother. Off camera, a maniacal Gates could be heard encouraging the child to dress in high heels and lingerie so she could better please her “new mommy and daddy.�?  That evidence, taken in tandem with Gates’ vaccine fraud, prompted the military to launch a global manhunt for the socially awkward but ruthlessly dangerous nerd.  Sources told RRN that Gates’ wife Melinda played a crucial role in his arrest.  “Initially she was reluctant to fully cooperate, because she felt that knowledge of her involvement might jeopardize the fortune she aims to get from the divorce settlement, most of which has not been paid. But JAG has evidence proving that she had knowledge of the child trafficking and told her she’d be charged alongside Bill if she didn’t cooperate. It turned out that Bill had been spamming her with enciphered emails only she could decode. He wanted to reconcile. The military used that to its advantage,�? our source said.  Melinda finally answered him, our source added, and agreed to a meeting. She told Bill to name the time and place. In response, Bill Gates suggested a house he had owned in Myrtle Beach. Although the military had been conducting surveillance on all known Gates-owned properties, the Myrtle Beach house had escaped military notice, because Gates had purchased it under an alias.  When Gates showed up, the Marines were waiting, our source said.  He was taken into custody and is currently being detained at an unknown location pending transportation to Guantanamo Bay, our source added.

Says ""This WILL NOT Be Banned, The American People Have a Right To Have Access To This""  Recently Ben Carson made some comments in an interview with Pamela Brown and Ryan Browne about a brain booster that would become the biggest event in human history  Ben Carson credits his ability to function and maintained focused on such a high level to a certain set of ""smart drugs"" that enhance cognitive brain function and neural connectivity, while strengthening the prefrontal cortex and boosting memory and recall.  In an interview with Bill O'Reilly, Ben Carson said that his brain is sharper than ever, more clear and focused and he credits a large part to using NZT-48. Ben Carson went on to add ""The brain is like a muscle, you got to work it out and use supplements just like body builders use, but for your brain, and that’s exactly what I’ve been doing to enhance my mental capabilities"".  Everyone that has taken this, from athletes like Tom Brady to actors like Robert De Niro have nothing but praise for the brain booster, which doubles IQ, skyrockets energy levels and connects areas of the brain not previously connected. NZT-48 works so well for these guys, we had to ask... Is it safe?  After 7 years Harvard Scientists Finally Break New Ground & Usher In The Future Of Brain Science With Invention Of New Smart Drug That Increases IQ, Memory And Focus Up To %100  Over a decade ago ago Harvard assembled a team of neuroscientists to work on coming up with a natural brain supplement that could effortlessly boost IQ.

367,36570252281361431084124261358364492198,"Further evidence proving the Covid-19 vaccination programme is a huge failure has been released which confirms throughout the whole of August 80% of the people who allegedly died of Covid-19 had been vaccinated against the disease.  We’re living in strange times, and if you believe the Covid-19 vaccination programme is working because the authorities on the television tell you that it is, then you must surely find it extremely strange that the UK is in the middle of a third wave in the middle of summer? Especially when you consider that in summer 2020 Covid-19 deaths flat-lined to zero even though a Covid-19 injection was not available.  But the strangeness doesn’t end there, just take a look at the latest Covid-19 Statistical Report released by Public Health Scotland (PHS) on the 8th September 2021.  The report provides an array on data on testing, quarantining, vaccinations, cases, hospitalisations, and deaths but it doesn’t get very interesting until you read Table 15 which covers the number of Covid-19 positive cases by week and vaccination status.  Interesting because it shows that the majority of confirmed cases are now among the vaccinated population. In the most recent week from 28th August to 3rd September 2021 the report shows that there were 20,744 confirmed cases among the unvaccinated population, who are more likely to be tested for the simple reason they have not been vaccinated.  But it also shows that there were 5,508 confirmed cases among the partly vaccinated population, and 16,810 cases among the fully vaccinated population – two populations who are least likely to be tested due to be being vaccinated.  This means that between 28th August and 3rd September there were 22,318 cases among the vaccinated population – almost 2,000 more than the unvaccinated population.  The same can also be said for the week of 21st August to 27th August which saw 15,647 cases among the unvaccinated population and 22,234 cases among the vaccinated population, and the same can also be said for the previous two weeks before that.  The data actually shows that between 7th August 2021 and the 3rd September 2021 there were 47,580 cases among the unvaccinated population, 21,020 cases among the partly vaccinated population, and 41,748 cases among the fully vaccinated population. Meaning there were 15,188 more cases among the vaccinated population.  So now that we’ve cleared up that the experimental Covid-19 injections clearly do not prevent infection or spread of Covid-19, let’s find out if they prevent hospitalisations like the authorities claim.  According to table 16 of the report between the 28th August 2021 and the 3rd September 2021 there were 36 admissions to hospital related to Covid-19 among the unvaccinated over 60 population, whilst there were 7 admissions on the partly vaccinated population.  However, there were a huge 299 admissions among the fully vaccinated over 60 population, and the same pattern can be seen for the weeks previous all the way back to the 7th August 2021.  In all for the week of 28th August to 3rd September 2021 there were 271 hospitalisations among the entire unvaccinated population but 423 hospitalisations among the fully vaccinated population. If we base these hospitalisations occurring after the previous weeks confirmed cases then we can calculate the case-hospitalisation rate.  In the week beginning 21st August there were 15,047 confirmed cases among the unvaccinated population. Therefore based on the unvaccinated hospitalisation figures of 271 in the week beginning 28th August the case-hospitalisation rate is 1.7%. However, when we carry out the same calculation for the fully vaccinated population hospitalisations (423) and cases (14,519) we can see that the case-hospitalisation rate is 2.9%.  Therefore, this shows that the Covid-19 injections are increasing the risk of hospitalisation when exposed to Covid-19 by 70% rather than reducing the risk by the 95% claimed by the vaccine manufacturers and authorities.  So now that we’ve cleared up the Covid-19 injections increase the risk of hospitalisation rather than reducing it let’s find out if they prevent deaths like the authorities claim.  Table 17 of the Public Health Scotland report shows the number of deaths to have occurred via vaccination status. However, PHS have been very clever in the way they’ve presented the number of deaths. Because rather than present them on a week by week basis like they have with the number of cases and hospitalisations, they’ve instead included deaths all the way back to the 29th December.  This means they are including deaths from the height of the alleged second wave of Covid-19 where just 9% of the population had received a single dose, and just 0.1% of the entire population were fully vaccinated. Therefore, PHS are very sneakily able to give the impression that the majority of Covid-19 deaths are occurring among the unvaccinated population.  The above table is taken from the report released by Public Health Scotland on the 18th August 2021 and shows deaths due to Covid-19 by vaccination status between the 29th December 2020 and the 5th August 2021. As you can see anyone reading the report would be given the impression that the vaccines are doing a fantastic job at preventing death due to Covid-19.  But fast forward to the most recent report and you will find on Table 17 that there have been 3,102 deaths among the unvaccinated population, 279 deaths among the partly vaccinated population and 298 deaths among the fully vaccinated population between the 29th December and the 26th August 2021.  Therefore, the true number of deaths by vaccination status between the 5th August 2021 and the 26th August 2021 are as follows –  Unvaccinated population – 25 deaths  Partly vaccinated population – 6 deaths  Fully vaccinated population – 92 deaths  This means the unvaccinated population have accounted for just 20% of alleged Covid-19 deaths throughout the whole of August, whilst the fully vaccinated accounted for 75% of them. But couple the partly vaccinated deaths with the fully vaccinated deaths and you can see that throughout August 80% of deaths occurred among the vaccinated population.  However this makes it hard to work out the case-fatality rate so to do this we need to look at how many deaths occurred in the previous weeks report. Up to the 19th August there had been 3,096 deaths among the unvaccinated, 277 deaths among the partly vaccinated, and 264 deaths among the fully vaccinated.  Therefore, the true number of deaths by vaccination status between the 19th August 2021 and the 26th August 2021 are as follows –  Unvaccinated population – 6 deaths  Partly vaccinated population – 2 deaths  Fully vaccinated population – 34 deaths  If we base these deaths on occurring two weeks after the number of confirmed cases then we can work out the case-fatality rate.  In the week beginning 7th August there were 3,788 confirmed cases among the fully vaccinated population. Therefore based on the unvaccinated death figures of 6 in the week beginning 19th August the case-fatality rate is 0.15%. However, when we carry out the same calculation for the fully vaccinated population hospitalisations (34) and cases (3,490) we can see that the case-hospitalisation rate is 1%.  Therefore, this shows that the Covid-19 injections are increasing the risk of death when exposed to Covid-19 by a huge 566% rather than reducing the risk by the 95% claimed by the vaccine manufacturers and authorities.  What’s even more concerning about this is that the number of confirmed cases among the fully vaccinated population have rose significantly in the most recent week compared to four weeks prior. Therefore the number of hospitalisations and deaths that could occur in the next few weeks could possibly be enough for the authorities to justify another lockdown.  The data clearly shows the jabs do not prevent infection or transmission, and it clearly shows that they are increasing the risk of hospitalisation and death rather than reducing the risk.

368,218551857775976356780709070668628574494,"A military tribunal at Guantanamo Bay has convicted Microsoft Founder Bill Gates on charges including child trafficking, pedophilia, conspiracy, money laundering, murder, and public health endangerment—the conclusion of five days of heated testimony that repeatedly saw Vice Adm. John G. Hannink of the U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General’s Corps square off against attorney David Baluarte.  The fireworks continued Wednesday morning as Vice Adm. Hannink offered into evidence additional proof of Gates’ illicit ties to the vaccine industry. Documents obtained from Gates’ personal server outlined how he in 2011 distributed vaccines “carrying serious side effects up to and including death�? to 41,000 children in poverty-stricken India, after meeting “mild�? resistance from vaccine distributors in the U.S. Gates claimed the vaccination granted absolute immunity against a strain of “super polio�? that was ravaging the impoverished.  Rather than inoculate recipients against polio, the vaccine exacerbated it and left over 40,000 children crippled or dead. And while cases of polio indeed were on the rise, the mysterious “super polio�? was pure fiction, invented by Gates and a consortium of international vaccine distributors. Gates even travelled to India to help administer the product, which was often given orally, as a sign of good faith.  “By his own documents, Gates and his people had waged a massive marketing campaign to convince the people of India that his “super polio�? was resilient to current vaccinations and that only his product, which he personally endorsed, could stave off the imaginary, virulent strain. He had the audacity to handfeed his poison to innocent children,�? Vice Adm. Hannink addressed the tribunal.  Baluarte objected: “Let’s pretend a moment that this court is just. Let’s further pretend these outlandish tales are true. How, tell me, can an American military court prosecute for crimes against foreigners on foreign soil?�?  “If all things were equal, that would be correct,�? Vice Adm. Hannink admitted. “But all things are not equal. American missionaries worked alongside medical staff in India. Some of those American missionaries had young children—children who took the Gates vaccine.�?  Six of six children, Vice Adm. Hannink said, developed complete and irreversible paralysis, followed by cerebral hemorrhaging and death within 90 days of inoculation.  Since the children were American citizens, born to American parents, the military had authority to prosecute Gates for their deaths, as is stipulated in the Insurrection Act of 1807, which Donald J. Trump activated prior to leaving office.  “Gates’ diabolical ventures didn’t stop with India,�? Vice Adm. Hannink told the 3-officer panel. “Four years later, he repeated his so-called humanitarian mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo—that time claiming he’d developed a cure for HIV. And while we can’t prove any Americans died of that drug, we know at least 27,000 Africans did—and this all points to motive.�?  Vice Adm. Hannink pivoted to more current events, questioning Gates’ relationship to Dr. Anthony Fauci.  “You met privately with Fauci five times, at his home and yours, between December 2019 and July 2020. Your own documents discussed ‘donating’ tens of millions of dollars to pharmaceutical manufacturers in exchange for getting 10 times your ‘investment’ back once vaccines were marketed. In your own words, Fauci approved of the idea. If you’re such a philanthropist, why were you expecting kickbacks?�? Vice Adm. Hannink said.  Gates’ lawyer instructed him to not answer the question.  “And did you not discuss placing what you referred to as a ‘nano-centric biometric recorder’ into vaccines—a chip, as it were, that would send biomedical data of recipients back to the vaccine manufacturers and to the NIH and to the CDC without the recipient’s knowledge?�? Vice Adm. Hannink went on. “This invasion of privacy—and we are working to determine if this took place and the scope—is just another of example of Gates’ madness. We believe the Office of Military Commissions has offered enough prove to convict the accused and sentence him to death. But that decision is in your hands,�? he told the 3-officer panel.  The officers needed not one minute to reach a unanimous decision; they found Gates guilty on all charges and asked that he be hanged for his atrocities. Vice Adm. Hannink set an execution date of October 5, 2021.  (Visited 116,502 times, 42,432 visits today)",Military Convicts Bill Gates,false

The ruling has proved that the government faked COVID-19 death statistics.  Following a citizen’s petition, a Lisbon court was forced to provide verified COVID-19 mortality data.  According to the ruling (read full judgment below), the number of verified COVID-19 deaths from January 2020 to April 2021 is only 152, not about 17,000 as claimed by government ministries.

The data are from the Sistema de Informação dos Certificados de Óbito (Death Certificate Information System – SICO), the only such system in Portugal.  Subscribe to GreatGameIndia  The reference to 152 death certificated issued ‘under Justice Ministry supervision’ is spurious, as all death certificates are issued under Justice Ministry auspices, being the only institution that issues them.  Last year, a Portuguese appeals court has ruled that PCR tests are unreliable and that it is unlawful to quarantine people based solely on a PCR test.  The court stated, the test’s reliability depends on the number of cycles used and the viral load present. Citing Jaafar et al. 2020, the court concludes that  “if someone is tested by PCR as positive when a threshold of 35 cycles or higher is used (as is the rule in most laboratories in Europe and the US), the probability that said person is infected is less than 3%, and the probability that said result is a false positive is 97%.”  In Germany, it was revealed according to extensive email exchanges obtained by a group of lawyers in a legal dispute, that the German Interior Ministry hired scientists to develop fake coronavirus model in order to justify strict lockdown.

Yet, time has shown that he was far from the patriot many of us considered him to be.  The Bushes were neither patriots nor great Republicans.  In fact, the battle wasn’t Republican vs. Democrat, but globalists vs. nationalists instead!  It was between the ones who truly love this country, and the ones who would try to destroy America in all ways possible.  Things are much clearer now.  The video below reveals one painful truth- GWB admits there were explosives used in 9/11!  Yet, he does not “come clean” and admits the truth, but he tells it just because he is not smart enough!  Watch it below:  This is not the first time allegations of explosions have been made, and a mountain of evidence indicates that it was a controlled demolition.  Actually, Trump stated the same the week of the wreckage.  Daily Commercial News reported:  “Despite strong contrary arguments, a McMaster University engineering professor steadfastly maintains the collapse of three World Trade Center buildings after the infamous 9/11 attacks can only be adequately explained if “controlled demolition” is part of the equation.  Robert Korol, a civil engineering professor emeritus and a fellow of the Canadian Society of Civil Engineering, authored a report with Steven Jones, former professor of physics at Brigham Young University, Anthony Szamboti, a mechanical design engineer in the aerospace and communications industries and Ted Walter, director of strategy and development for Architects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth (AE911Truth). The report was titled 15 Years Later: On the Physics of High-Rise Building Collapses published last year in the Europhysics News journal which is a magazine for the European physics community and owned by the European Physical Society.  In the controversial paper, the authors reflect the overarching premise of the AE911Truth, which has collected 2,936 signatures from engineers and architects. Among those petition signatories are 19 who earned their respective degrees in Canada, including 15 who live here.  AE911 Truth posits: “there is sufficient doubt about the official story and therefore the 9/11 investigation must be re-opened and must include a full inquiry into the possible use of explosives that might have been the actual cause of the destruction of the World Trade Center Twin Towers and Building 7.”  The group has long been controversial and its arguments have ignited many debates. The overwhelming consensus has favoured the official explanation which states that fires burning inside the buildings weakened the structural steel and triggered their collapse. This has consistently been reaffirmed by U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) over the last 16 years.  The Europhysics News editors also recognize the controversy, publishing the article with the following note: “This feature is somewhat different from our usual purely scientific articles, in that it contains some speculation. However, given the timing and the importance of the issue, we consider that this feature is sufficiently technical and interesting to merit publication for our readers. Obviously, the content of this article is the responsibility of the authors.”  Reached at his home in Dundas, Ont., Korol shrugs off the controversy.

It didn’t make sense.”  JEFFMOCK/WIKIMEDIA COMMONS — World Trade Center Building 7 is the red-tinted building behind and to the left of the Twin Towers.  While the most iconic images of that fateful day are the collapse of the twin towers World Trade Center 1 (WTC 1) and World Trade Center 2 (WTC 2) within moments of each other, following the fires started by a passenger airplane crashing into each of them, there is a third building most often cited as the smoking gun in the “controlled demolition” theory. This building, World Trade Center Building 7 (WTC 7) was not hit by any aircraft and yet it too imploded like a house of cards, says Korol and his co-authors and others note it housed CIA and Secret Service offices.  “Indeed, neither before nor since 9/11 have fires caused the total collapse of a steel-framed high-rise — nor has any other natural event, with the exception of the 1985 Mexico City earthquake, which toppled a 21-storey office building,” they argue. “Otherwise, the only phenomenon capable of collapsing such buildings completely has been by way of a procedure known as controlled demolition, whereby explosives or other devices are used to bring down a structure intentionally.”  Korol, who has taken contrarian positions on other engineering-related issues, says it’s important to keep challenging the status quo because we need to know how and why the buildings collapsed in order to prevent reoccurrences.  “The fires were on the upper floors, there’s little chance the heat would have spread down and caused the steel columns, or the connectors or floor beams, to sufficiently weaken and collapse in the twin towers,” he tells the Daily Commercial News.  “Also they were treated with a fire retardant which would have insulated them.”  Further, he says, when the structures did fail they did so with such explosive force that pulverized concrete was ejected at high velocity and scattered on a debris field some 370 meters away.  NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION/WIKIMEDIA COMMONS —  An aerial view of the remains of the collapsed World Trade Center (WTC) buildings on 9/11. The original footprints of the WTC Twin Towers 1 and 2 and Building 7 are outlined.  The most probable explanation is a controlled explosion and most likely using thermite, he says, adding in the case of WTC 7 some 67 percent of the supporting steel strength in Column 79 — pinpointed as the cause of the fatal collapse — would have to be lost before it failed and that would mean temperatures of 660C.  The paper also notes sprinkler systems would have reduced heat factors, while the overall design of the steel structure would isolate any failure and prevent a domino effect collapse.  The NIST however maintains the heat factor triggered an expansion in floor beams, pushing them off their seats and causing the collapse when other components also failed due to thermal expansion.  Korol and other like-minded colleagues, stubbornly disagree.”  Watch more here:  Source:  https://canada.constructconnect.com",SHOCKING VIDEO FOUND: George W.

371,338625293913082082343892341639272241016,"Twenty-seven active-duty U.S. Air Force pilots have resigned their commissions over the unconstitutionality of Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin’s mandate requiring all Armed Forces members to at once receive a Covid-19 vaccination, Real Raw News has learned.  The exodus began on August 27, with 12 pilots from the 1st Fighter Wing at Joint Base Langley-Eustis, Virginia, submitting to their commanding officer letters of resignation only hours after they received a 4:00 a.m. text message instructing them to submit to mandatory Covid-19 vaccinations by 10:00 a.m. that same day. It’s unknown whether the pilots collaborated ahead of resigning, but all 12 resignations were handed in within a 90-minute period.  One officer, a 29-year-old F-22 Raptor pilot, said of the situation, “We undergo routine physicals and must meet rigorous fitness standards to stay on flight duty. I think it’s safe to say all Air Force pilots are in good physical condition. We must be to endure extreme G-force stress on our body. There is no reason we should be at risk of Covid-19 or becoming sick from it. I know I’m not alone in rejecting this potentially dangerous and soundly untested shot.”  Pilots at other airbases apparently joined him in solidarity.  A day later, 15 pilots of the 2nd Bomb Wink in Barksdale, Louisiana tendered letters of resignation after they, too, received orders to get the jab. The orders stated explicitly that any officer refusing a Covid-19 vaccination would lose his flight status and be subject to disciplinary action, including a potential dishonorable discharge from the service.  A pilot with the 2nd Bomb Wing told RRN that he and his fellow pilots marched into their commanding officer’s office and dropped the resignation letters on his desk. He added that airmen and maintenance crews—enlisted persons who cannot simply resign from the service—are also furious about the mandatory vaccination requirement. Several of them, he told RRN, have sent hardship letters asking for early dismissal from the Air Force, mainly because they don’t have faith in a vaccine that has killed thousands of healthy people, military and civilians alike.  “This is only the beginning. A lot more of us will be turning in our wings,” he said.  RRN will provide additional details on this topic as it develops.

According to sources familiar with the arrest, U.S. Customs and Immigration Services detained Hunter Biden and friends moments after they had claimed baggage at Dulles International Airport in Washington, D.C.  Preliminary information suggests that a suitcase in Biden’s possession held several kilograms of “crack-cocaine” and that his two companions, based on passport information, were 13 and 14 years old.  Why or how Dubai authorities did not notice the drugs remains unknown; typically, baggage is x-rayed at the point of departure, not arrival, and it’s highly unusual for the TSA or Customs to detain passengers at baggage claim.  Nor is it immediately clear why Dubai allowed two underage females to accompany Hunter Biden on the flight.  Our source said that Customs alerted the military to Biden’s arrival, and that plain clothed Delta Force operators were at once dispatched to apprehend Biden before he had a chance to call his father or other Deep State associates.  Biden and his female colleagues were heavily intoxicated or stoned at the time of arrest, a military source told RRN. All three had bloodshot eyes, slurred speech, and could barely stand on their own two feet without aid.  “Do you know who my father is? You can’t do shit to me, motherfucker,” Hunter Biden purportedly told a Delta Force operator.  “Guess what? We don’t work for your father,” the operator replied.  Hunter Biden was separated from the females and taken to a holding facility at an unknown location.  RRN will provide additional details as they develop.

373,300647870900688744198621265127915881071,"Military cadets at West Point Academy who refuse to take one of the controversial COVID vaccines are being put in solitary confinement, with more stringent restrictions than those who tested positive for the virus.  At West Point Military Academy, a number of cadets are currently rebelling against the push from the Biden administration and military higher-ups to take one of the controversial COVID-19 vaccines. 700 cadets who initially refused the vaccine were brought together into a meeting room, and were briefed as to the benefits of the vaccine. The number of cadets has now dwindled significantly after allegations of daily pressure by “senior officials” at the school, and rumors of reductions of leave. Some cadets relented and received the vaccine, while many left West Point due to the pressure.  Those who still refuse to take the vaccine are forced to wear masks everywhere, marking them out from everybody else who is vaccinated. A number of parents of those holdouts have now organized legal counsel on behalf of their children, with CDMedia reporting that they are “banding together to fight this perceived criminal behavior by those in power over their children.  An anonymous whistleblower, whose identity National File is protecting, gave a breakdown of the current restrictions that West Point cadets who refuse to take the COVID vaccine have to face. For those cadets returning for summer programs, they will have their two week leave shortened to one, as they have to spend 7 days in a quarantine that amounts to serious solitary confinement. The cadets are locked up for 23 hours each day in one room, and are only allowed out for one hour to walk or run outside.  Crucially, these cadets are not tested for COVID-19 before they are put into self-isolation. In fact, they are only tested at the end of the period. If they test negative, they will be released to their training programs. In a letter sent to the cadets deemed “high risk,” there was no detail as to what would happen if the cadet tested positive instead, in terms of whether they would be forced to endure another week or more of the solitary confinement. National File contacted West Point for details on this program via phone and email, but did not receive a response by the time of publication.  The new regime could not accurately be described as self-isolation or quarantine, as such programs already existed at West Point for cadets returning after the summer and Christmas breaks this academic year who tested positive. For those cadets, before the vaccination program kicked into high gear, they would be restricted at some points, but could also work out in the outside gyms, and leave their accommodation to go and order food, albeit being ordered to stay away from cadets who were not infected. These luxuries are not afforded to the cadets who refuse to take the vaccine, even though they may not have the virus.  West Point allegedly plans to round up all the cadets who are refusing the vaccine and transfer them into all one company or platoon based on how many they’re are. At the time of writing, around 50 cadets have not backed down. The whistleblower said this would likely be better for them, as they would not be around other troops who derogatorily shout at them, calling them “anti-vaxxers,” and instead would be with those who stand with them. “They’re being treated like criminals,” the whistleblower added. “They’re trying to protect other people’s rights and their rights are being compromised.”  National File reported last year on two successive suicides from the Colorado Springs Air Force, with students expressing to the academy that the deaths may have been linked to depression springing from the then extremely strict social distancing policies and punishments for violating the six-foot distance protocols. Following the deaths, looser restrictions were enacted.",EXCLUSIVE: Biden’s Military Puts West Point Cadets in Solitary Confinement If They Refuse COVID Vaccine,false
374,326441662820194383475388131882863837561,"On June 21 the Office of Military Commissions convicted former Attorney General William Barr on charges of treason, buttressing Donald J. Trump’s assertion that Deep State operatives had infiltrated nearly every crevice of his administration. Upon learning of Barr’s fate, Trump reportedly told his inner circle “Justice was served” and that Deep Staters masquerading as Republicans are not impervious to military justice.  Real Raw News can now report that Barr was taken into custody on May 21, when U.S. Marines operating under the guidance of the Insurrection Act arrested the traitor at his McClean, Virginia, home. He was promptly taken to Guantanamo Bay, where he lived in a 6X9’ cell while awaiting his tribunal date.  On Tuesday Barr had his day in court. In an opening statement, he said he had been fiercely loyal to Donald J. Trump prior to his ousting. He said he had helped craft many of the indictments on which the military was now acting, under the belief that Trump was interested in “draining the swamp.” But in November Barr had an epiphany; he told the tribunal that Trump had instructed him to author indictments on persons who had no ties to the political arena, and that it was his opinion that Trump’s indictments were designed to settle personal scores and vendettas, not to restore political integrity.  “President Trump subverted my trust and judicial authority. When he showed me a list of people to be indicted, I was shocked. I asked him why this or that person was being indicted, and he told me ‘Because they’re criminals, Bill.’ When I asked for proof, he told me ‘Don’t worry, Bill, we’ll find the proof.’ I refused to participate any further in his witch hunt, and that’s why I tendered my resignation on 23 December,” Barr addressed the tribunal.  His explanation didn’t seem to impress Rear Adm. Darse E. Crandall, who had successfully prosecuted the military’s case against John Podesta.  “An interesting, largely fictional telling of what happened. Let’s be honest with each other here, Mr. Barr. You were given an opportunity to resign—to save face. Not that it mattered because, unbeknownst to you, you were already under scrutiny. If you had moral and ethical issues with the indictments back in April, May, June, July, August, September, October, and November, why would you wait until Dec 23 to resign? That doesn’t make much sense,” Rear Adm. Crandall said.  Barr countered that he wanted to give Trump every chance to realize he had taken a precipitous turn toward the dark side and to return to the light.  “I tried to help him,” Barr said.  “The truth is exactly the opposite, isn’t it, Mr. Barr. Trump kept you around because he keeps his friends close and his enemies closer, and he gave you every opportunity to amend your mistakes. Then you stabbed him in the back by denying election fraud and supporting a fraudulent president. And certainly you understand that bribery, especially for an appointed official, is akin to treason,” Rear Adm. Crandall said.  He showed the panel incontrovertible proof of Barr’s criminal maleficence—financial documents proving the Barrs—William and Christine—had received a $7,000,000 “donation” deposited into a 501C3 titled “Conservative Truth Initiative.” The depositor, a Chinese national with indisputable ties to the DNC, spread the funds across several bank accounts. The deposits had hit the Barrs’ accounts on 2 December, one day after Barr excoriated Trump on national television.  “I submit to you,” Rear Adm. Crandall told the three-officer tribunal, “that William Barr did knowingly collaborate with the enemy to undermine and delegitimize the democratically elected President of the United States, Donald J. Trump, and in doing so betrayed his oath to the U.S. Constitution. Simply put, treason.”  “What I did was take action to protect the United States. If I had to, I’d do it again. I’d do it five times over,” Barr said.  Fifteen minutes later, the panel found Barr guilty of treason, seditious conspiracy, advocating overthrow of government, recruiting for the service against the United States, and enlistment to serve against the United States, and decreed that he be executed for his crimes in accordance with U.S.C. Title 18 and provisions specified in the Insurrection Act of 1807.  Rear Adm. Darse has scheduled Barr’s hanging for August 2.  (Visited 4 times, 4 visits today)",Military Convicts William Barr,false
375,268370668370648255738660118533503945304,"According to a 2014 study published in the Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis, pilots suffer an increased risk of clotting issues due to frequent and prolonged air travel. Pilots are encouraged to be aware of the signs of deep venous thrombosis and clotting issues and take preventative measures such as compression stockings and stretching of their legs during long flights.  Medical News Today published a study on June 15th, 2021 that showed an increased risk of blood clotting and low platelets in AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine recipients. Some scientists hypothesize that since the ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) in the shot causes a full body reaction, once the vaccine comes into contact with platelets inside the human body, the vaccine activates those platelets, causing them to change shape and transmit chemical signals to the immune system. Those platelets send out platelet factor 4 (PF4), which regulates blood clotting.  However, in some people, after some undetermined amount of time, at random, PF4 latches onto the vaccine, and large “complexes” form. Since those complexes are “unknown,” the human body interprets those clusters as threats. Thus, immune cells in the body mistakenly attack PF4’s, prohibiting them from preventing the problematic clots seen in some COVID-19 vaccine recipients.  Pilots have an increased risk of blood clots. COVID-19 vaccine recipients have an increased risk of blood clots. Reuter’s and Fact Checkers cannot hide the fact that an increased risk on top of an increased risk is potentially a disaster, but neither has any regard for human life or the truth, as evidenced by the propaganda they’re currently creating by the minute.  Delta Airlines now requires the COVID-19 vaccine for all new employees, potentially putting Delta employees at risk of blood clots and death. American Airlines doesn’t require the vaccine but gives its employees one day off of work and $50 for getting the vaccine. No mention of the inherent risk for non air employees, let alone those who spend ample time in the clouds, is ever made by Delta or American.  At British Airways, at least four pilots have died this week, but the airline wants you to know that their deaths are totally unrelated; Reuter’s and Fact Checkers are working hard to dispel any rumors that the pilots could have died from the COVID-19 vaccine. British Airways boasts that 85% of its employees are vaccinated. Airlines are so quick to obey the COVID-19 vaccine narrative that they forget the welfare of their own employees is at stake.  According to flightaware.com, 120,000 cancellations per year is the average for global flights. An average day would see 329 cancellations. A 2 day average would see 658 cancellations. But between Friday and Saturday, 3,533 cancellations occurred. That’s a 580% increase in cancellations globally in the past 2 days.  Southwest delayed or cancelled hundreds of flights last week and blamed a host of issues such as technical difficulties and weather on the cancellations and delays. American Airlines announced Sunday that it would cancel hundreds of flights through mid-July. American blames weather issues and labor shortages on its preemptively cancelled flights. British Airways, which has seen at least 4 pilots die recently, cancelled hundreds of flights but then furloughed thousands of its employees with 85% pay this week.  Not to worry; the same agencies (mainstream media, Reuters, and Fact Checkers) tasked with exploring the safety and efficacy of a vaccine for the general public and for pilots who transport 6 million people per day also ruled out a Wuhan lab leak and any conceivable voter fraud in the 2020 elections. Those agencies have reversed their stance on one of those issues, the Wuhan lab leak, only after it became impossible not to do so. One day, it’s conceivable that the media may reverse its stance on the COVID-19 vaccine…when it becomes impossible not to do so…  Pilots are already at increased risk of blood clots; categorizing them as high risk for a vaccine with a known side effect of blood clots isn’t misinformation. It’s science.  For now, pilots should exercise their right to medical freedom and refuse to become vaccinated. Clearly, the truth isn’t coming anytime soon.  ~Darcy Schoening",Thousands of flights cancelled as vaccinated pilots fall ill or die,false

378,329248425970434586987123600788117578994,"William Jefferson Clinton’s military tribunal at Guantanamo Bay began on Friday, following a three-day delay caused by a female panelist whose amorous display of affection toward the former president shocked the Office of Military Commissions.  The joviality and swagger Clinton displayed on Monday had evaporated when uniformed MPs escorted him to GITMO’s south courtroom Friday morning. A much more sullen and forlorn Bill Clinton, head hung low, was seated at the defense table beside the advocate he had chosen to represent him, the venerable David E. Kendall.  Kendall is an American attorney, a graduate of Wabash College, Yale Law School, and Worcester College, Oxford, who clerked with Supreme Court Justice Byron White, worked as associate counsel at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, and has been a partner at Williams & Connolly LLP of Washington, DC since 1981, where he has provided legal counsel to individuals and corporations on high-profile business and political matters. He represented Clinton during the 1998-1999 impeachment proceedings stemming from Clinton’s relations with White House intern Monica Lewinski.  At the start of Friday’s proceedings, Kendall boldly asked Rear Adm. John G. Hannink to “dismiss without prejudice” all charges leveled against Bill Clinton. Those charges include murder, sex crimes against minors, treason, theft of government property,  “President Clinton should not have to answer for the crimes of Hillary Rodham Clinton, who has already been sentenced and put to death. For many years, William Jefferson Clinton was largely oblivious to his wife’s transgressions, and once he became aware of them, he had only a peripheral involvement, at best. Make no mistake, she called all the shots. My client was along for the ride,” Kendall said.  “It was all Hillary,” Bill Clinton said.  But Vice Adm. Hannink was unimpressed at Clinton’s refusal to take accountability for his misdeeds. Paraphrasing author Peter Schweizer’s observation in the book Clinton Cash, Vice Adm. Hannink noted that “the couple that steals together, stays together,” and expounded on that theory by telling the tribunal that “apparently, the couple that kills together, stays together too.”  “And there is no statute of limitations on murder, not even for you, detainee Clinton,” Vice Adm. Hannink said.  “My client never killed anyone,” Kendall interjected.  His statement prompted Vice Adm. Hannink to play a taped telephone call for the tribunal. It was a 1993 conversation between Bill Clinton, then-Attorney General Janet Reno, then-ATF chief David Chipman, and former FBI director William Sessions. The call, recorded on day 50 of the Waco standoff between Branch Davidian leader David Koresh and U.S. alphabet agencies, underpinned Clinton’s mounting hatred of not only Koresh but also the women and children sheltered within the compound. Reno, Chipman, and Sessions urged Clinton to swiftly resolve the protracted stalemate, arguing that his indecisiveness would empower future “domestic terrorists” and religious zealots to follow in Koresh’s footsteps. Reno pleaded with Clinton to “burn them out,” and both Chipman and Sessions, after expressing mild trepidations, agreed the situation had become untenable. Clinton gave them “carte blanche,” and encouraged them to eliminate “malcontents” as long as blame was assigned to Koresh and the U.S. government was held harmless for any fatalities.  “I don’t care what happens to them, they didn’t vote for me anyway,” Clinton said on the call. “If they die, they die. Just make sure the finger can’t be pointed back at us, or more importantly, me. Let’s nip this in the bud right now.”  As most know, on day 51 the FBI and ATF launched a siege on the Branch Davidian Compound. A fire consumed the facility, and 76 Branch Davidians, including Koresh, 25 children, and two pregnant women, were reduced to ashes. Janet Reno later claimed that Koresh had burned out his own people, even though video footage of government vehicles and personnel equipped with flamethrowers and other incendiary devices surfaced in pictures and video.  On a recorded telephone call captured three days after the siege, Clinton congratulated Reno, saying the Branch Davidians “got what they deserved.”  In GITMO’s south courtroom, Vice Adm. Hannink replayed the recording several times.  “This was not Hillary; this was all you. You were president, not your wife. Nowhere is she heard on these calls. No one here is saying Koresh was a nice guy. But you, detainee Clinton, ordered those deaths,” Vice Adm. Hannink said.  Kendall objected, claiming the tapes had not been entered into discovery and, thus, he had been given no opportunity to rebut their validity.  “I understand you were an accomplished civilian litigator, Mr. Kendall, but this is a military commission, operating under full force and effect of the insurrection act,” Vice Adm. Hannink replied.  Kendall altered his tone and calmly requested a 72-hour continuance, until Monday morning, to allow him to authenticate the tapes.  “Very well, this commission will grant you your 72 hours, but we’ll tolerate no further delays after this,” Vice Adm. Hannink said.  He put the tribunal in recess until ten hundred hours Monday morning.  (Visited 49,340 times, 13,771 visits today)",Bill Clinton Military Tribunal: Day 1,false

The confidentially agreement which can be viewed here states that providers ‘Moderna’ alongside the ‘National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases’ (NIAID) agreed to tranfer ‘mRNA coronavirus vaccine candidates’ developed and jointly-owned by NIAID and Moderna to recipients ‘The Universisty of North Carolina at Chapel Hill’ on the 12th December 2019.  Found on page 105 of the agreement  The material transfer agreement was signed the December 12th 2019 by Ralph Baric, PhD, at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and then signed by Jacqueline Quay, Director of Licensing and Innovation Support at the University of North Carolina on December 16th 2019.  Recipient signatories found on page 107  The agreement was also signed by two representatives of the NIAID, one of whom was Amy F. Petrik PhD, a technology transfer specialist who signed the agreement on December 12th 2019 at 8:05 am. The other signatory was Barney Graham MD PhD, an investigator for the NIAID, however this signature was not dated.  NIAID signatories found on page 107  The final signatories on the agreement were Sunny Himansu, Moderna’s Investigator, and Shaun Ryan, Moderna’s Deputy General Councel. Both signautres were made on December 17th 2019.  Moderna signatories found on page 108  All of these signatures were made prior to any knowledge of the alleged emergence of the novel coronavirus. It wasn’t until December 31st 2019 that the World Health Organisation (WHO) became aware of an alleged cluster of viral pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China. But even at this point they had not determined that an alleged new coronavirus was to blame, instead stating the pneumonia was of “unknown cause”.  It was not until January 9th 2020 that the WHO reported Chinese authorities had determined the outbreak was due to a novel coronavirus which later became known as SARS-CoV-2 with the alleged resultant disease dubbed COVID-19. So why was an mRNA coronavirus vaccine candidate developed by Moderna being transferred to the University of North Carolina on December 12th 2019?  The same Moderna that have had an mRNA coronavirus vaccine authorised for emergency use only in both the United Kingdom and United States to allegedly combat Covid-19.  What did Moderna know that we didn’t? In 2019 there was not any singular coronavirus posing a threat to humanity which would warrant a vaccine, and evidence suggests there hasn’t been a singular coronavirus posing a threat to humanity throughout 2020 and 2021 either.  Considering the fact a faulty PCR test has been used at a high cycle rate, hospitals have been empty in comparison to previous years, statistics show just 0.2% of those allegedly infected have died within 28 days of an alleged positive test result, the majority of those deaths by a mile have been people over the age of 85, and a mass of those deaths were caused by a drug called midazolam, which causes respiratory depression, and respiratory arrest.

Baric – who’s attended conferences at the Wuhan Institute of Virology and is described by Wuhan’s “bat woman” Shi Zhengli as one of her “longtime collaborators” – made the comments at an April 2018 event hosted at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill. Baric – who’s described lifting bans on gain-of-function research as “critical” – also provided the Wuhan lab with humanized mice to likely conduct the controversial form of research with SARS-like coronaviruses.  “Gain-of-function represents one of those approaches that is a crucial tool for public health preparedness and response,” Baric asserted in 2014 while lobbying against a moratorium on gain-of-function research.  During his 2018 speech “Imagining the Next Flu Pandemic – and Preventing it!” he presents a slide titled “Global Catastrophe: Opportunities Exist.” The slide outlines what type of stocks and industries surged during the Ebola outbreak, which he uses to extrapolate financial advice on how to “make money in the next pandemic.”  “I wanted to give you good news. There are winners out there, right? So if you ever want to be prepared and make money in the next pandemic, if that’s what you want to do, buy stock in Hazmat suit makers and protective clothing or companies that make antiviral drugs for that particular pandemic,” he notes.  Baric adds that the aforementioned sectors and stocks would “probably do pretty well” before highlighting that “there are actually mutual funds for pandemic preparedness.”  “Some products do well. 1918 including masks, same thing today,” he advises.  While speaking over the following slide – “Pandemics: Opportunity” – Baric posits that “pandemics really are times of opportunity.”  “There is an opportunity for people to have political gain, financial gain, and personal gain during times of social upheaval, and that will probably occur,” he adds.

On Monday, June 7, Brennan shared Hillary Clinton’s macabre fate—death by hanging after a military tribunal convicted him of murder and treason. Unlike Clinton, who remained steadfastly silent until the very moment the noose was slipped around her neck, a loudmouthed Brennan cussed out the guards who offered him a last respite, which he declined, berated his MP escort to gallows, and rebuked the small assembly of military and civilian personnel who had gathered near the Windward Point Lighthouse to witness his death.  In fact, Brennan had scarcely shut his mouth in the weeks between conviction and execution, said a GITMO source speaking on condition of anonymity. He told Real Raw News that Brennan availed himself of every opportunity to express contempt at the U.S. military and the citizenry. Brennan spent much of his incarceration deriding Donald J. Trump, calling him society’s great mistake and a threat to national security. He said Trump ought to have been “aborted.”  His swaggering bravado, however, did not stop GITMO staff from escorting him to gallows early that morning. At precisely 8:00 a.m., he climbed atop the same apparatus that was used to execute Hillary Clinton less than two months prior. Shackled at the wrists and bound at the ankles, he stood on the trap door that would swing open beneath his feet when Vice Adm. John G. Hannink ordered the 5-man execution detail to push the circular red buttons affixed to the lattice framework.  Vice Adm. Hannink reminded the detail to press the buttons in synchronicity, after, and only after, he issued the ‘execute’ command. Only one button would trigger the ghoulish device, and no soldier would ever know if his button ended Brennan’s life.  “Your all pussies and cowards, especially you, Adm. Hannink. I don’t see the three cowardly officers who passed sentence on me here, either. Where are they? No stomach. Where’s Trump? I figured he ain’t got the testicular fortitude to watch his handiwork in action. He’s a fucking pussy, and you’re all cowards and liars for following him. Let’s get this over with. I ain’t scared of shit,” Brennan said, as an MP slipped the noose around his neck.  Vice Adm. Hannink approached the gallows and tilted his head to meet Brennan’s menacing stare.  “This is not about Donald J. Trump. This is about you and the actions you’ve taken in the name of evil. Trump just had the guts to get the ball rolling, but one way or another, with or without Trump, your fate was sealed the moment you participated in the murders of innocent civilians. Trump may have been the catalyst, but you’re here because, frankly, you’re one evil sonofabitch,” Vice Adm. Hannink said.  “Do your master’s bidding; I’ll see you and Trump in hell,” Brennan retorted.  The ‘execute’ command was given, and the door beneath Brennan’s feet swung downward. His neck snapped, and the rope was cut. Brennan’s lifeless body lie motionless on a patch of grass. A military physician felt for a pulse and declared Brennan dead.  “Today justice has been served,” Vice Adm. Hannink said to the assembly.

The females, RRN has learned, had cellophane-wrapped packets of cocaine strapped to their torsos, and Hunter Biden’s suitcase held 3kg of crack-cocaine. RRN cannot explain why customs in Dubai did not spot the contraband before they boarded the flight.  RRN has learned that the U.S. military conducted a simultaneous raid on Biden’s posh Venice, CA mansion, which he reportedly leases from Sweetgreen Co-founder Johnathon Neman at the cost of $25,000 per month.  A source at the Office of Military Commissions told RRN that Special Forces stormed the lavish estate within minutes of Biden’s apprehension at Dulles. The Rapid Deployment Teams, our source added, had standing orders to arrest Biden when he was least protected and to search his home for evidence of drug and child trafficking, and child pornography.  Upon entering the residence, Special Forces met resistance in the form of two Secret Service agents who had been assigned to guard the home. The Secret Service, like the intelligence agencies and rogue military commanders, have sided with Biden and the Deep State rather than devote its resources toward protecting American freedoms. The agents drew weapons and tried to repel Special Forces, but both Secret Service agents were killed in a brief but explosive firefight. Neither Biden’s wife, Melissa Cohen, nor his children were home at the time of the raid, our source said.  Special Forces seized 6 laptops, 2 desktop computers and five cellular phones from the residence. They also found a disguise kit, which Hunter had apparently used to alter his appearance, and 7 passports in 7 different names.  In a closet they found and confiscated 400 grams of crystal meth and 150 Ecstasy tablets, the latter being a popular party drug, as well as a shoebox of drug paraphernalia.  “The drugs weren’t hidden; the computers were in the open. It’s like Hunter really didn’t care if anyone came by and just saw this stuff sitting around his house. I’m sure that’s because he felt protected, that his father would always be there to protect him. The data on the electronic devices is currently being analyzed by military cybersecurity specialists.

384,337329842699580300915600481601900922156,"Traitor. Murderer. Pedophile. Luciferian. Clinton co-conspirator. John Podesta was the embodiment of evil—“was” being the operative word. On Tuesday morning at precisely 8:00 a.m. GITMO time, a military firing squad composed of Marine volunteers gave Podesta a 6-gun salute—center mass.  Two hours earlier, military police had awoken Podesta and asked whether he wanted a final meal. A tearful and trembling Podesta reportedly refused a last repast, saying he had no appetite while whining about how Donald J. Trump and the U.S. military had convicted an innocent man.  Shackled at the wrists and ankles, Podesta was placed in a Humvee and driven to a clearing a kilometer southeast of Marine Hill, home to the fictional Lt. Col. Nathan R. Jessup in the film A Few Good Men.  The clearing was featureless except for freshly trimmed grass and a cement wall that measured 6’x6x2’. A small group of both military and civilian onlookers watched as two MPs removed Podesta from the Humvee and escorted him to the cement barricade, demanding he stand motionless before it.  The most recognizable attendees were Rear Adm. Crandall, who prosecuted the military’s case against Podesta, and, surprisingly, Marine Corps General David H. Berger, who recently assumed the role of Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff after unseating Gen. Mark A. Milley, who now stands accused of treason.  Six marines, rifles at their side, faced the barricade—and Podesta–at 20 yards.  “If the condemned has any last words, or wants Last Rites, now’s the time,” Rear Adm. Crandall said.  “I don’t want to die. I didn’t do anything. This is an aberrant violation of due process. I don’t want to die alone like this,” Podesta said.  General Berger spoke up: “You needn’t worry about dying alone. Hillary’s waiting for you, wherever you’re headed, and we’ll be sending plenty more company your way.”  Asked whether he wished to be blindfolded, Podesta said, “Does it matter?”  Rear Adm. Crandall addressed the firing squad: “When I give the command to fire, you’re to fire your rifles simultaneously, center mass. The magazines on your rifles hold only one round each. You will chamber that round on the ‘ready’ command. One cartridge holds a blank. If any of you soldiers feel guilty afterward, just convince yourself that it was your rifle that fired the blank. Remember, you volunteered for this duty.”  He gave the ‘ready’ command, and the Marines raised their rifles and chambered their single round of ammunition.  “Aim,” Rear Adm. Crandall said.  The Marines drew a bead on Podesta’s chest.  Podesta called out to God.  “Fire!” Rear Adm. Crandall ordered.  At once the six Marines discharged their weapons, and Podesta’s perforated body slumped forward and collapsed to the ground. A physician present felt for a pulse and placed a stethoscope to Podesta’s blood-stained chest, then declared him dead.  (Visited 3 times, 3 visits today)",John Podesta Executed at GITMO,false
385,180628028931948671764090752641540963259,"While waiting for the final decision on the controversial vaccine, Norway has decided to distribute its stock of AstraZeneca to fellow Nordic countries that actually want to use them despite the associated risks.  Norwegians run a greater risk of dying from being inoculated with AstraZeneca's vaccine than from COVID-19, the National Institute of Public Health (FHI) concluded in its analysis, recommending the vaccine, previously linked to serious complications in the form of rare blood clotting and haemorrhage amid low platelet counts.  Abstaining from the vaccine could possibly prevent up to 10 deaths related to side effects, the FHI said, according to the newspaper Verdens Gang.  So far, Norway has seen five cases of serious incidents reported shortly after vaccination, with three fatalities. FHI has calculated the mortality rate from the AstraZeneca vaccine as 2.3 people per 100,000 vaccinated.  The FHI stressed that continuing to inoculate will by contrast expose younger women to an “unreasonably high risk”, given the current relatively levels of infection in Norway.  Furthermore, the institute is against offering the vaccine on a voluntary basis, which has been proposed both in Norway and fellow Scandinavian nations.  “We believe that such an alternative may appear unethical and with a high risk that those who make such a choice have not fully understood the risk to which they are exposed,” the institute said.  The FHI also ventured that recommending the AstraZeneca vaccine for further use could lead to lower confidence among the population in vaccination programmes in general.  “This could lead to a lower vaccination rate and vaccination rate in the long run, and that patients in risk groups will also say no to vaccines.”  A recent survey by the FHI in collaboration with Mindshare and Norstat, indicated that 76 percent of the respondents were sceptical of at least one of the vaccines, even though 82 percent were initially positive about getting vaccinated. Of the vaccines, AstraZeneca gained the highest level of scepticism at 99 percent, compared with Moderna (9 percent) and Pfizer (8 percent).  However, the government believes it is too early to discontinue the vaccine completely, and is instead launching a new expert group to further investigate both AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson, which triggered similar concerns.  Pending a final decision, however, Norway has decided to distribute its stock of AstraZeneca to fellow Nordic countries that actually want to use them.  Of the Norwegian stock, Sweden will borrow 200,000, while 16,000 will go to Iceland.  “If the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine is resumed, we will get back the doses we lend as soon as we request it. Sweden and Iceland will then send back the doses from their first deliveries from AstraZeneca,” Health Minister Bent Høie said, as quoted by Verdens Gang.  The Swedish Public Health Agency has made a different assessment of the AstraZeneca vaccine and has concluded that the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks and the side effects.  The agency's Swedish equivalent, the Swedish Public Health Agency, has, however, made a completely different assessment and believes that the benefits of the vaccine far outweigh the risk of side effects.  State epidemiologist Anders Tegnell described the contentious vaccine as having a “high protective effect” and “reducing the risk of serious illness and death, especially among the elderly and weak”.  Earlier this spring, dozens of countries temporarily stopped the use of the AstraZeneca shot amid reports of side effects. Of them, many, like Sweden, have since resumed inoculation, citing a precarious infection situation and shortages of other vaccines.",Norway: Risk of Dying From AstraZeneca Higher Than of COVID-19,false

387,254172053131429149393140837627105343371,"(Natural News) Nearly a decade prior to the release of Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) “vaccines,” the Health Ranger was warning us all about future “self-spreading” injections that threatened to annihilate humanity from the face of the earth.  Self-spreading vaccines, in case you are unfamiliar with them, spread without even having to be injected. The vaccinated simply “shed” them onto others through close contact, infecting the unvaccinated with chemical particulates that could sterilize or kill them.  We are already seeing this happen with Chinese Virus injections, which are causing women to have irregular periods and men erectile dysfunction. In short, Wuhan Flu shots are a death sentence for those who take them, and possibly even those who do not.  Back in 2012 when the Health Ranger was warning about “self-replication pollution,” most people were only thinking about genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and nanotechnology. Today, it is more widely understood that such bioweapons also include vaccines.  As the Health Ranger explained, “self-replicating microscopic machines” were being used even then to advance the depopulation agenda. Also known as self-replication microscopic weapons, such technology serves one purpose: to kill people.  Vaccines are the virus  Last fall, the mainstream media was discussing how self-replicating technology was already being investigated for use in conjunction with Chinese Virus injections.  Recognizing that a majority of Americans would probably reject a vaccine for an alleged virus with symptoms that mirror a mere cold or cough, the medical deep state came up with a plan to quietly vaccinate all of society without having to inject every single person.  Self-replicating vaccines thus became a solution to the problem of vaccine “hesitancy” because they have the capacity to spread vaccines via infection – meaning if you are close to someone who was recently injected, you very well could “catch” the vaccine from them through their saliva or nasal discharge.  This sounds a whole lot like what the medical fascists have been saying about the Chinese Virus itself, except there was never any definitive proof that the virus could be spread that way. Meanwhile, we now have solid proof showing that the injections, and those who receive them, are the vectors spreading disease.  Because injected people are basically walking disease factories, avoiding them at all costs could go a long way in protecting yourself against infection.  One of the scariest things about self-spreading Wuhan Flu shots is the fact that they will never again be contained now that they have been released. Even the medical deep state admits that this is the case, warning that once released, “scientists will no longer be in control of the virus.”  “It could mutate, as viruses naturally do,” warns Filippa Lentzos, writing for The Bulletin. “It may jump species. It will cross borders. There will be unexpected outcomes and unintended consequences. There always are.”  “Self-spreading vaccines are essentially genetically engineered viruses designed to move through populations in the same way as infectious diseases,” Lentzos further reveals.  Since there is not much we can do at this point other than to try to avoid those who have been vaccinated, the next best thing is to build up your immune system in any way you can. Even more importantly, pray for protection for yourself and your family because we are now in completely uncharted territory.  “We are watching a genocidal transgenerational plan unfolding. Bill Gates is executing it on behalf of dead men and others who shared their goals,” warns Vince Morreno. “This is diabolical. Satanic.

388,319949773570685690790917144392729638292,"Scrambled eggs with jalapeno peppers, and a strawberry milkshake. The last meal of the condemned.  Hillary Rodham Clinton was hanged at Guantanamo Bay Monday night, her death the culmination of an operation that began on March 2 when U.S. Navy SEALs on Donald J. Trump’s authority arrested the disgraced politician at her Chappaqua, NY mansion. After a five-day tribunal at the world’s most infamous detention center, a three-officer panel found Clinton guilty of murder, accessory to murder, treason, child trafficking, and other high crimes. Clinton, who had refused counsel, had uttered nary a word throughout the proceedings, and had taken Vice Adm. John G. Hannink’s sentence of death with an unflinching gaze.  The hanging took place at the Guantanamo Bay courtyard at 9:05 p.m., at once after Taps, which marks the start of quiet hours on U.S. military bases across the globe.  “The world is about to sleep quieter tonight,” Vice Adm. John G. Hannink said to a small assembly that included 3 Joint Chiefs of Staff and, notably, Donald J. Trump, who, garbed in his typical dark suit and crimson tie, had arrived at GITMO earlier in the day. Michael Pompeo and former NYC Mayor Rudy Giuliani flanked him, both men having played an integral role in amassing evidence against Clinton.  Under military guard, a shackled Hillary Clinton was escorted from Camp Delta detention block to gallows made of steel latticework, with a downward swinging door beneath her feet, that the Army Corps of Engineers had erected in a clearing near Windward Point Lighthouse, on GITMO’s southern edge. Affixed to a steel beam was a rectangular box with five circular, red buttons protruding from the case. In front of each button stood a uniformed soldier. Atop the platform, another soldier slipped a braided noose around Clinton’s neck.  Vice Adm. Hannink addressed the execution detail: “When I say ready, and not one moment before, you will poise your left index finger in front of the button. You will keep it hovered there until I say execute, and then you five must simultaneously press your button. Only one of the five buttons will trigger the door, and none of you will ever know which button that was. Do you understand these instructions?”  “Yes, sir,” the five bellowed in unison.  A chaplain and a physician climbed the 13 steps leading to the top of the platform and stood beside a soldier who was checking to ensure the noose was secure around Clinton’s neck. Below them, Vice Adm. Hannink asked if Clinton wanted last rites or had any final words.  Clinton broke silence. “I’m Hillary Clinton, you can’t do this to me,” she said, her voice a witch’s cackle.  “It’s already done,” Donald J. Trump shouted up at her.  “Ready.” Vice Adm. Hannink nodded at the execution detail.  After a moment’s pause, he gave the “execute” order, the soldiers pressed their buttons, and the grate beneath Clinton’s feet swung open. Her legs and feet, still shackled at the ankles, twitched a moment or two, then stopped.  The rope was cut, and Clinton’s lifeless body lie sprawled in a damp patch of grass. The physician present checked her vitals and declared her dead.  A confidential source involved in Trump’s mission to obliterate the Deep State said the overall mood was somber and melancholy; there was no celebration, no jubilation, just an atmosphere of contentedness, an acknowledgement that what had to be done, was done. The nature of her crimes overshadowed celebratory thought. But a four-decade reign of terror had come to an end.  “As much as Trump hated her, this was purely business. He cares about the children who suffered at her hands more than he cares about what she did to him. Yes, her demise sends a signal to the Deep State. But Trump knows there are many more to go, and he won’t celebrate till the job is done,” our source said.  (Visited 3 times, 3 visits today)",Hillary Clinton Hanged at GITMO,false
389,313504545446504736069610580521861619855,"President Joe Biden handed the border crisis off to Kamala Harris so that she could get a handle on the humanitarian catastrophe the Biden administration created.  So, since she has been placed in charge of the problems created by the surge of Unregistered Democrats illegally crossing our southern border, Harris has yet to visit ground zero to get a look-see at the administration’s handiwork. Remember when Harris laughed at questions asked by reporters on when she was going to visit the border? “Not today, HAHAHAHAHA!” #EyeRoll  Harris may not have made it to the border yet but her book has already made it there to be dropped into welcome bags that are given out to unaccompanied illegal border crossing migrant children at a Long Beach, California shelter where they are being held.  “Superheroes Are Everywhere” was published in January 2018. Harris wrote the book, a picture book that currently sells on Amazon for $11.85. It is recommended for children 3–7 years old. The book was seen inside welcome bags that were packed up for unaccompanied minors as they arrive at the Long Beach Convention & Entertainment Center along with basic hygiene supplies and clothing.  You have to wonder how this happened because things like a person’s book being placed into a welcome bag for illegal aliens isn’t just a coincidence.  The White House played dumb – and unfortunately for them, no one knew the difference – when a White House official said the administration was not aware that the book was being distributed. The official then blamed it on local volunteers. The official told Fox News that local communities usually put together welcome bags for illegal migrants, and the White House is using that in hopes that the blame for the story goes to the volunteers at the Long Beach facility, which makes sense because Democrats never take responsibility for anything. Remember, just a couple of weeks ago they were still saying there is no crisis at the border?  It doesn’t really matter who did it. The point is doing it is an ethical violation and I believe illegal as well. Remember when Harris and Biden said the administration was going to be the most transparent in history? Yeah, whatevs.  Remember when liberals went nuts after Kellyanne Conway promoted Ivanka Trump’s brand? She was a senior advisor to the president. Kamala is Vice President of the United States!  On Friday, Harris actually did travel to a border state, but I don’t think New Hampshire counts because the Biden administration hasn’t yet created a crisis on our northern border. But then, it is still early. Harris has traveled back to her home state of California, but she was spotted nowhere near the southern border. She wasn’t spotted near the borders in Arizona, New Mexico, or Texas either.  This news means at least 1,000 of Harris’ books were purchased because that’s it can house how many illegal alien children at the facility in Long Beach. Normally, Democrats make their fortune by writing a book that the unions spend millions purchasing as payback for policies and programs Democrats passed that exclusively help unions. They then either donate to libraries around the country or use them in their fireplace.  What will the kids use the book for? They can’t read it as it is written in English. In what way is Kamala Harris’ children’s book useful to Spanish-speaking illegal alien children?  At $11.85 a pop, for 1,000 illegal children, that comes to $11,850. Who paid for that? Did you and I pay for it out of our tax dollars? If so, then Kamala Harris made good money on a scam giving these illegal alien kids her book. It’s important to find out who paid for the books because if this administration gets away with personally enriching the VP like this at this early stage of the administration, there’s no telling what kind of money-making schemes they’ll do in the near future. Hunter Biden may be tasked to sell Kamala’s book over in China for all we know.  And the same raging liberals who thought Donald Trump gave away free rooms in his hotels to foreign diplomats as a bribe won’t care one way or the other about Harris’ book scandal. One way liberals can figure out if something is not right is to close their eyes and imagine that Trump did it instead.",White House Denies Knowing Anything About Kamala Harris’ Book Ending Up In ‘Welcome Bags’ For Illegal Migrant Children in California,false
390,260297137620471377175155125632676289573,"Last month Real Raw News reported on a shocking incident at the Pentagon, the seat of America’s military might: The man who calls himself president, Joseph R. Biden, had visited the Pentagon under the pretense of conducting a surprise presidential inspection. His real impetus was to learn whether a rumor he had heard was true, that Donald J. Trump was in the building meeting secretly with Marine Corps General David H. Berger, which could explain why Pentagon police denied him access to the property. While RRN cannot confirm Trump’s presence, we can now authenticate earlier reports that pointed to a dramatic shift in power at the nation’s most fortified structure.  On April 14, two days before the Pentagon Protection Force turned away a shocked and confused Biden, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark A. Milley summoned the 7 other Joint Chiefs to the Pentagon for an emergency meeting, according to a confidential source involved in Trump’s mission to eliminate Deep State operatives throughout the nation.  Gen. Milley, our source said, lambasted his colleagues for allowing high-ranking officers from all branches of the U.S. Armed Forces to undermine Biden’s presidency. Gen. Milley said Biden was the democratically elected President of the United States, and that all armed forces personnel, from the lowest private to the highest general, had a patriotic duty to support and protect Democracy, Joseph Biden, and Kamala Harris.  “From what we know, he went off, ballistic-like. He was a cursing machine, swearing at and excoriating these highly decorated, lifelong members of our country’s military. He said he’d heard they were helping Trump do what he called ‘secret and illegal arrests’ of prominent active and retired politicians. He kept blasting them and told them he was going to recommend that Biden and Harris fire them,” our source said.  Gen. Milley reportedly offered the other Joint Chiefs of Staff a final chance to abandon their allegiance to Donald J. Trump and swear fealty to Joseph R. Biden and Kamala Harris.  Of all the Chiefs, only one leapt to his feet in support of Biden. Gen. Daniel R. Hokanson, Chief of the National Guard Bureau, denounced Donald Trump and told Gen. Milley that he and the National Guard would honor their oath to the Constitution He said they were prepared to defend Biden’s presidency with their lives, if necessary.  Our source said Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps David H. Berger, a longtime supporter of Donald Trump, passed Gen. Milley an envelope. The envelope held an arrest warrant issued by the U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General’s Corps. It named Gen. Milley as a traitor to America and its people.  “Except for you and this coward,” Gen. Berger said, pointing at Gen. Hokanson, “we all support this great nation and what it stands for, and we reject the forces of darkness destroying what our Founding Fathers worked so hard to codify. We stand for a nation, not a man. Why are you so eager to say Kamala Harris’s name in every sentence with Biden’s name? We know why.”  Gen. Milley, our source added, shredded the warrant, calling it a joke, and promised Gen. Berger he would hang for treasonous behavior.  “If anyone hangs, it won’t be me,” Gen. Berger reportedly said. “We’ve been expecting this for a long time.”  A dozen armed members of the Pentagon Protection Force entered the conference room and handcuffed Generals Milley and Hokanson.  In closing, our source said Milley and Hokanson have since been shipped to Guantanamo Bay, where they will ultimately answer to a military tribunal.  Asked if Donald J. Trump was at the Pentagon on April 16, our source replied: “I cannot say yes or not. I can tell that what’s happening now is a prelude to his reinauguration on Independence Day.”  (Visited 2 times, 2 visits today)",Pentagon Coup! Joint Chiefs Overthrown,false
391,337864618343651181462830701883037240745,"A military tribunal on Thursday convicted former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on charges of murder, conspiracy to commit murder, accessory to murder, child trafficking, endangering a minor, treason, and sedition.  The two male, one female panel of officers cast a unanimous verdict shortly after Vice Adm. John G. Hannink, who prosecuted the military’s case against Clinton, showcased his final witness for the prosecution, Clinton’s former strategist and lover, Huma Abedin.  In exchange for leniency and a plea deal, Abedin testified she and Clinton had “shared” underage children with her estranged ex-husband, Anthony Weiner. Pressed to clarify her definition of the word “shared,” Abedin qualified her answer by saying they had “practiced” lewd and lascivious behavior on underprivileged minors Clinton had imported into the United States.  “American children?” Vice Adm. Hannink asked.  “Yes, but not primarily. They’re too easy to track. More often than not from poor countries,” Abedin replied.  “Would you tell this tribunal how you appropriated these children?” Vice Adm. Hannink asked.  “Hillary used her government credentials. She had carte blanche, as a Secretary of State, former Secretary of State and former First Lady. It was easy for her to bring orphaned children in from places like, say, Syria, Afghanistan, or Iraq. No one asked questions. No one to look for them,” Abedin replied callously.  Asked to quantify their exploits, Abedin said she couldn’t count the number of underage boys and girls Clinton had brought to the United States under the pretense of providing them with a fruitful life, but she told the tribunal there had been “many,” most of whom were later “sold or donated” to influential members of the Clinton cabal.  “Who are the people?” Vice Adm. Hannink asked.  “We never knew, exactly. It’s not like Hillary peddled them herself. She had someone handle that, and I don’t know the person’s name,” Abedin replied.  “And yet she still refuses to speak,” Vice Adm. Hannink observed.  He asked the tribunal whether they had heard enough; that the military had presented overwhelming evidence of Clinton’s atrocities against the United States and humankind. Unlike a conventional criminal trial, he reminded the commission, a unanimous verdict was not needed to convict Clinton on any of the charges. A majority vote, he said, would satisfy justice.  The tribunal arrived at a guilty verdict after deliberating only five minutes. They found Clinton guilty on all charges the military had laid out—the murders of Seth Rich, Vince Foster, and Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia; trafficking and abusing minors from Haiti and other third-world nations; conspiring to assassinate a presidential candidate.  As she had throughout the tribunal, Clinton stayed eerily silent as the verdict was read and the officers recommended she receive the death penalty for her crimes. Vice Adm. Hannink asked Clinton if she had preference in how the military carried out her sentence, but still she refused to speak.  “You refused counsel. You refused to defend yourself. This tribunal therefore decides that the defendant, detainee Hillary Rodham Clinton, be hanged by the neck until dead,” Vice Adm.

Trump is a big fan of all first responders, but none more than police officers. Donald Trump spoke about early aspirations to be a police officer, but his family business came calling louder. That did nothing to diminish his love for law enforcement.  Donald Trump has been following the trial of Derek Chauvin, the police officer who is accused in the death of George Floyd. Trump knows he is innocent, and he sprung to action. It’s been a secret, but it’s now in the open. Donald Trump is funding Chauvin’s legal defense. Every penny of it. Trump has called the accusations against Chauvin a witch hunt, much like the Russian witch hunt he himself dealt with from the liberal democrats. He seems a lot of himself in Derek Chauvin.  Much like Chauvin, Donald Trump is a pretend tough guy, with fans acting as if Chauvin was some kind of super cop, just like they pretend Trump was a super president. Little do the democrats know, Trump likes to bet big on people. Usually the worst people. So he is paying Derek Chauvin’s lawyers. Well, maybe, Trump doesn’t really pay anyone, so there’s sure to be a lawsuit here somewhere.  Presidential historian Joseph Barron says there’s no precedent for this, usually leaders stay out of murder trials, but this is different. Trump being a racist helps Chauvin, so the Minneapolis cop will be benefiting from Donald Trump’s own prejudice. It’s a win win for Trump, as it shows his pretend love for law enforcement and it’s a plus because Chauvin apparently hates the same kind of people Trump does.  It’s no surprise that Chauvin backers are the same mindless lunatics that supported Donald Trump. All of the evidence is there, yet they gloss over it and scream “media bias” and fold their hands over their extended bellies and straighten out their dirty MAGA hats. They’re not going to put up with any kind of common sense or decency. God bless America.",Trump Picking Up Officer Chauvin’s Legal Fees,false
393,284526447952731111868534647897743252826,"The man who calls himself President of the United States, Joseph R. Biden, was denied entry to the Pentagon on Friday, Real Raw News has learned.  Shortly after meeting Democratic lawmakers to discuss more restrictive gun-control legislation, Biden went to Arlington, VA to advocate the merits of his planned withdrawal of all U.S. Armed Forces from Afghanistan. He had also sought to convince military leaders that Iran’s decision to enrich weapons-grade plutonium to 60% did not threaten U.S. interests, said an administration source speaking under condition of anonymity.  But Biden never made it inside.  Our source said U.S. Pentagon Police, part of the Pentagon Force Protection Agency, stopped Biden and his Secret Service detail in their tracks, informing them that they had standing orders to prevent Biden administration members–including Biden–from entering the building. Those orders reportedly included the use of deadly force.  “Biden demanded to know who gave the order, stumbling through his words, and was told the directive came directly from Gen. David H. Berger, Commandant of the United States Marine Corps and a ranking member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. When Biden demanded to speak with Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley, he was told Milley—a Biden supporter—was no longer in charge,” our source said.  Biden, our source added, became belligerent, saying as the President of the United States he had unrestricted access to all federal properties, including the Pentagon. He then instructed his three-man SS detail to “resolve the issue.”  Pentagon police drew sidearms, our source said.  “The Pentagon Protection Force told the SS agents they’d be making a mistake. That there were over a hundred inside ready to back them up if trouble started. The SS didn’t want any part of that and told Biden he’d have to force his way in himself, if he was so inclined,” our source said.  Moreover, Biden purportedly muttered an unbelievable phrase: “I bet that bastard is inside.”  We can only guess as to whom he was referring, but RRN guesses he meant none other Donald J. Trump. While it seems unlikely, we must remember that Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley opposed Trump’s presidency and was one of few high-ranking military leaders who supported Biden’s alleged 2020 victory. It is possible that Gen. Milley has been overthrown, and Marine Corps Gen. David Berger has assumed command of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  RRN will provide updates as they become available.

394,301325565766686385308273876017007793324,"The U.S. military has arrested disgraced former FBI Director James Comey on charges of treason, sedition, obstruction of justice, and aiding and abetting persons actively involved in criminal behavior, Real Raw News has learned.  Donald J. Trump greenlit the Tuesday morning raid on Comey’s lavish, suburban home after speaking to Marine Corps Col. John Lynch, commanding officer of the Marine Raider regiment at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. Col. Lynch committed at least two 4-man squads to the mission, said a confidential source involved in Trump’s quest to depose Joseph Biden and restore America to the people.  On Tuesday at about 3:00 a.m., U.S. Marines operating on Donald Trump’s authority stormed Comey’s seven-bedroom, 10,700-sqaure-foot mansion in McClean, Virginia. Although most operational details are classified, our source said Raiders surprised Comey, who was half-asleep in bed, and apprehended him after he reached for a pistol underneath a pillow. Before he could palm the weapon, a Marine charged forward and struck Comey’s forehead with the butt of his rifle, rendering Comey unconscious.  “Trump’s people had digital surveillance on the Comey residence for quite a long time. They knew Comey’s wife, Patrice, would be out of town on personal business, and none of the kids would be around visiting. Trump’s been anticipating this moment a long time; it’s a day of reckoning,” our source said.  Trump, our source added, had authored a sealed indictment on Comey shortly after firing him on May 9, 2017. He had obtained irrefutable evidence proving that Comey, an Obama holdover, had been on Clinton’s payroll and, on her authority, tried to slander the president by linking the Trump campaign to Russian interference in the 2016 election. Moreover, Trump had obtained a 2015 audio recording in which Comey told Hillary Clinton he would “do whatever it takes, no matter what” to scuttle Trump’s bid for the presidency. Additionally, Trump learned that Comey’s faux investigation into Clinton’s handling of confidential emails was merely for effect, optics to avoid the appearance of impropriety and bias.  “Comey is criminal scum. He doesn’t have a modicum of decency. Trump also has the goods on him for wiretapping Trump Tower. Comey’s been taken to a secure holding pending transportation to GITMO, where he’ll face a military tribunal. One thing that’ll come out is that when Comey got hold of Anthony Weiner’s laptop, he found videos of Huma Abedin and Hillary Clinton doing some pretty terrible things to kids. Comey kept that info from the public, probably at Clinton’s request,” our source said.  In closing, we asked our source why, with so many arrests dropping, family and friends of the accused haven’t complained to CNN or MSNBC about their loved ones being abducted in the dead of night.  “The only explanation is the Deep State is keeping them silent,” our source said. “If it became officially known that people like Clinton, Podesta, Abedin, and now Comey have been nabbed by the military, it would weaken the Deep State’s hold on society—because it would show they are losing. And the Deep Staters always want to give the appearance of winning. They won’t be able to for much longer.”  (Visited 62,378 times, 4,331 visits today)",Military Arrests James Comey,false

As reported previously, U.S. Navy SEALs under Trump’s command staged a March 2 raid on Clinton’s Chappaqua, NY, estate, capturing her and seizing laptops that link the former First Lady to countless atrocities. She has been held under military guard at the Guantanamo Bay Detention Center Camp Delta since March 5.  In just over a week, the villainous, vile creature will stand before a military tribunal consisting of six U.S. military officers handpicked by Donald J. Trump and his advisory board. A Trump source familiar with the proceedings told RRN that the officers who will serve as both judge and jury cover a broad range of military ranks—from O-3 (captain) to 0-9 (Lt. General)—selected from all branches of U.S. Armed Forces.  “The choice was not done hastily. Trump’s team spent weeks picking the officers. Trump wanted to remove himself from the equation and ensure that the officers picked were not tainted by any bias for Clinton. No matter what, the odds are stacked against her. A tribunal isn’t an ordinary trial, and Clinton is no longer an American citizen,” our source said.  Stripped of her citizenship, Clinton is no longer afforded the protections of the U.S. Constitution and Geneva Convention. She is a detainee, or enemy combatant, which means she has no rights, not even the right to remain silent. In a military tribunal, silence is equated with guilt.  “Clinton was asked if she wanted an advocate to speak on her behalf, but the loon said she would defend herself. She decried the whole idea of a military tribunal as lunacy and has been babbling out how her people are going to free her. It doesn’t look good for her. She’s being charged with treason, sedition, assassinations, assassination attempts—the list goes on,” our source said.  Moreover, Trump has held Clinton responsible for the deaths of four Americans in the Benghazi Massacre: Ambassador Chris Stephens, Information Officer Sean Smith, and CIA contractors Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods, both former U.S. Navy SEALs. Clinton’s inaction led to their deaths; therefore, Trump decreed she must be held to account.  Our source said Clinton faces three possible outcomes: acquittal, life at GITMO, or a firing squad.

Britney Simmons, 24, was performing at the Camel Toe strip club when an altercation began between Simmons and several clients at the club.  Miami police were called to intervene and attempted to apprehend Simmons who was highly intoxicated and acting erratically according to the official police report.  Five Miami Police Department officers attempted to place Simmons under arrest but were momentarily indisposed when the lap dancer ejected vaginal fluids towards the officers, temporarily blinding three and injuring two.  “She just spread her legs wide open and started squirting in the cops’ faces, eyes and mouths from a distance of about twelve to fifteen feet,” one eyewitness told reporters, visibly amused by the whole affair.  “Knowing full well that she was exposing the police officers to a number of sexually transmitted diseases and potentially HIV as well, it is considered that she used her vagina with lethal force against the officers” explained Miguel Aguera, spokesman for the Miami Police Department.  Simmons’s attorney, Alan Smith, argued that his client acted in self-defense and used her vagina, not as a deadly weapon, but in the “appropriate boundaries of her working skills and abilities.”  According to current Florida laws and if convicted of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon against five police officers, Simmons could face up to 1,036 years in jail believe legal experts.

A confidential source familiar with Trump’s plan to drain the swamp and restore American prosperity to the people told RRN that U.S. Special Forces operating on Trump’s authority conducted simultaneous “nab and grab” missions to apprehend Clinton’s co-conspirators. Trump picked Easter Sunday to arrest the traitors because he believed it to be the best day to catch them unaware and at home, our source added.  Trump’s tactical expertise paid dividends.  At approximately 2:00 p.m., a Special Forces detachment out of Fort Bragg captured Abedin at her parents’ home near Lansing, Michigan, where the family had gathered for Easter dinner. Although Abedin is a radical Islamic Jihadist with obvious ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, she has spent her political years pretending to be a Christian and a follower of Jesus Christ.  “Trump learned Abedin would be at her parents’ house for Easter. As you know, Clinton is already at GITMO awaiting trial. She’s given up a lot of info, including on Abedin—she’s allegedly revealed that she and Abedin partook in Adrenochrome infusions from Haitian children. When Navy Seals captured Clinton, they found evidence of this on her laptops, and now her own words have incriminated her and her criminal conspirators,” our source said.

William Tenenbaum, 31, is lying in critical condition according to medical staff at Allendale County Hospital after being mistaken for a deer by two local hunters.  According to the two hunters, Tenenbaum was dressed and painted in the colors of a deer and was wearing antlers which made him unrecognizable to the two men.  “It was the first time in my life that I’d seen a deer stand up and walk on its two legs. That’s when I went for a clear shot to the lungs,” Harry Perkins, 72, told reporters, visibly shocked.  “The deer looked like it was rubbing its chest and its genitals and signaling us to come closer, it was very surreal” Thomas Pinecut, 68, admitted to reporters.

400,205138009495470707027148005016255904787,"The United States military has arrested Dr. Deborah Birx, also known as “the scarf lady,” after authenticating reports that she and her partner in crime, the still at-large Dr. Anthony Fauci, had conspired with the CDC to deceive the American public into believing that face masks were an effective method to mitigate the spread of Covid-19.  As reported in February, Birx’s name was placed on a sealed indictment after President Donald J. Trump obtained a lengthy email chain between her and Deep State Dr. Anthony Fauci. In it, Birx and Fauci discussed whether face masks mitigated the spread of Covid-19, and they admitted to one another that masks were completely ineffective at preventing Covid-19 from entering the human respiratory system. To the contrary, they acknowledged that protracted “masking” had serious side effects on human physiology, especially among the children, the elderly, and immunocompromised people.  Nonetheless, Birx wrote in an email to Fauci that “regardless of POTUS’s stance, we must continue to encourage and enforce masking because it will give people a sense of calm and make them feel safe.”  That illusion of safety was a major contributing factor in the deaths of 15,000 Americans, according to a military study that evaluated all alleged Covid-19 fatalities in the United States.  For example, a masked 13-year-old boy suddenly dropped dead while playing football in 90-degree heat in Reno, Nevada. It turned out he was asthmatic but had never received a clinical diagnosis. His mother, a mask advocate, had heard Dr. Birx say on television that outdoor activities did not preclude wearing a mask when social distancing was impossible. Since football is a contact sport, she feared her child might contract Covid-19 from another non-masked child, and thus demanded her son mask up anytime he was around other children. Her irrational fear, coupled with Birx’s hysteria, resulted in the boy’s death. Incidentally, the CDC claimed he died of Covid-19, even though the boy had never received a test.  Another example: A 26-year-old Long Island woman died after a short battle with Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, more commonly known as MRSA, a type of flesh-eating bacteria that is highly resistant to most antibiotics. She developed the illness, which attacked her face, days after her employer, citing CDC guidelines, imposed a mask mandate. The bacteria literally ate her face, leaving her unrecognizable. She expired three days later, and the CDC listed her cause of death as Covid-19.  Those are only 2 of 15,000 evaluated cases.  A confidential source involved in Donald J. Trump’s Deep State War said: “Along with Fauci, who will soon be apprehended too, the U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General’s Corps is holding Birx responsible for all the fatalities. It’s mass medical malpractice and mass murder. They acted on the indictment Wednesday morning.”  On 26 May, plain-clothed JAG investigators arrived at the multigenerational Pennsylvania home where Birx resides with her husband and the family of their eldest daughter. JAG, our source said, informed Birx she was being placed under arrest by order of the United States military and in accordance with Section 252 of the U.S. Insurrection Act of 1807. Birx reportedly appeared confused, and her husband, a lawyer, protested the “unlawful intrusion” of their home, saying that neither JAG nor Donald Trump had authority over the citizenry.  Birx was handcuffed and escorted from the home, and her family was issued a gag order forbidding them from discussing Birx’s arrest with the media. Violating the order, JAG told them, would carry a stiff penalty, including prison.  (Visited 96,941 times, 7,572 visits today)",U.S. Military Arrests Dr. Deborah Birx,false

Haim Yativ et le Dr Seligmann ont analysé les données vaccinales d’Israël dans un article publié sur le site Nakim.org.    Le Collectif citoyen de FranceSoir et l’association Bon Sens sont très attachés aux publications, analyses des données, du retour d'expérience des divers pays sur la vaccination, et se sont intéressés à l’article. Nous avons demandé à les interviewer afin de comprendre leur analyse et ses limites.  close  volume_off    Les auteurs de l'article déclarent n'avoir aucun conflit ou lien d’intérêt, autre que celui d’avoir des enfants en Israël.    Un debriefing complet qui, après une présentation, évoque leur analyse des données, les validations menées, les limitations et surtout les conclusions qu’ils demandent à confronter aux données demandées via une requête au ministère de la Santé, par le biais de l'équivalent de la CADA (Commission d’accès aux documents administratifs) israélienne.    Les constats sont simples :    Il y a une inadéquation entre les données publiées par les autorités et la réalité sur le terrain.    Ils ont trois sources d’information, outre les emails et messages d’effets secondaires qu’ils reçoivent par le biais d’internet.  Ces trois sources sont Ynet, site d'information israélien, la base de données du ministère de la santé israélien, et la base aux Etats-Unis du VAERS (effets secondaires).  En janvier 2021, il y a 3000 enregistrements d’effets secondaires des vaccins dont 2900 pour les vaccins ARNm.  Par rapport aux autres années, la mortalité est 40 fois supérieure.  Le 11 février un article de Ynet, présente des données liées à la vaccination. Les auteurs de l’article ont ""débunké"" cette analyse, en se basant sur les données publiées par Ynet.  « On a repris les données en regardant la mortalité pendant la période de la vaccination qui dure 5 semaines. En analysant ces données, on arrive à des chiffres effarants qui donnent une mortalité importante du vaccin. »  Les auteurs déclarent « que les vaccinations ont causé plus de décès que le coronavirus n'en aurait provoqué pendant la même période. »    Haim Yativ et le Dr Seligmann déclarent que pour eux « ceci est une nouvelle Shoah » devant la pression des autorités israéliennes pour vacciner les citoyens.    Ils invitent aussi les spécialistes à venir compléter leurs analyses, et entendent donner des suites judiciaires à cette découverte, si elle venait à être validée par les données du ministère : contacté, ce dernier n'était pas disponible...    https://www.francesoir.fr/videos-debriefings/vaccination-en-israel-des -chiffres-de-mortalite-qui-interpellent-video        _________________  הצטרפו לקבוצה של נקים בטלגרם לקבל עדכונים ולשתף.  https://t.me/Nakim_org_News  ולערוץ של נקים בטלגרם להתעדכן:  https://t.me/Nakim_org_Ch      הסקר קובע: רוב הציבור בישראל סבור שהשחיתות פוגעת בחייו היום יומיים,  חתום על העצומה נגד שחיתות הממסד ומערכת המשפט והצטרף ל""נקים""    ניתן להשיג את חיים יטיב הדובר של ארגון ""נקים"" באמצעות טלגרם @HaimYativ או דוא""ל  ניתן להשיג את חיים יטיב הדובר של ארגון ""נקים"" באמצעות טלגרם @HaimYativ או דוא""ל haim@nakim.org    השופט מישאל חשין:המלחמה בשחיתות היא מלחמה להגנה עצמית בה לא לוקחים שבויים  השופט מישאל חשין:המלחמה בשחיתות היא מלחמה להגנה עצמית בה לא לוקחים שבויים _________________הצטרפו לקבוצה של נקים בטלגרם לקבל עדכונים ולשתף.ולערוץ של נקים בטלגרם להתעדכן:  חיים יטיב              הצטרף: 23 ינו' 2006  הודעות: 914  דובר של `נקים`הצטרף: 23 ינו' 2006הודעות: 914    פורסם: חמישי 18.02.21 22:49 נושא ההודעה: Vaccination in Israel: Challenging mortality figures?    https://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/297051    Vaccination in Israel: Challenging mortality figures?  Analysis by infectious disease specialist claims mismatch between data published by authorities and reality on the ground.  Tags: Vaccination Mortality Biotechnology Israel Coronavirus  Mordechai Sones , Feb 18 , 2021 8:47 AM  Share    'Science will win': Pfizer  'Science will win': PfizeriStock    A front-page article appeared in the FranceSoir newspaper about findings on the Nakim website regarding what some experts are calling ""the high mortality caused by the vaccine.""    The paper interviews Aix-Marseille University Faculty of Medicine Emerging Infectious and Tropical Diseases Unit's Dr. Hervé Seligmann and engineer Haim Yativ about their research and data analysis. They claim that Pfizer's experimental shot causes ""mortality hundreds of times greater in young people compared to mortality from coronavirus without the vaccine, and dozens of times more in the elderly, when the documented mortality from coronavirus is in the vicinity of the vaccine dose, thus adding greater mortality from heart attack, stroke, etc.""    Dr Hervé Seligmann works at the Emerging Infectious and Tropical Diseases Research Unit, Faculty of Medicine, Aix-Marseille University, Marseille, France. He is of Israeli-Luxembourg nationality. He has a B. Sc. In Biology from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and has written over 100 scientific publications.      FranceSoir writes that they follow publications, data analyzes, and feedback from various countries on vaccination, and have therefore taken an interest in the Nakim article, asking to interview them in order to understand their analysis and its limitations.    The authors of the article declare they have no conflicts or interests other than having children in Israel.    After a presentation, the authors discussed their data analysis, the validations carried out, limitations, and above all, their conclusions that they compare with data received via a Health Ministry Freedom of Information Act request.    Their findings are:    There is a mismatch between the data published by the authorities and the reality on the ground.  They have three sources of information, besides the emails and adverse event reports they receive through the Internet. These three sources are Israeli news site Ynet, the Israeli Health Ministry database, and the U.S. federal Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) database.  In January 2021, there were 3,000 records of vaccine adverse events, including 2,900 for mRNA vaccines.  Compared to other years, mortality is 40 times higher.  On February 11, a Ynet article presented data related to vaccination. The authors of the Nakim article claim to have debunked this analysis based on data published by Ynet itself: “We took the data by looking at mortality during the vaccination period, which spans 5 weeks. By analyzing these data, we arrived at startling figures that attribute significant mortality to the vaccine.""  The authors say “vaccinations have caused more deaths than the coronavirus would have caused during the same period.""  Haim Yativ and Dr. Seligmann declare that for them, ""this is a new Holocaust,"" in face of Israeli authority pressure to vaccinate citizens.    They also invite specialists to complete their analyses, and intend to pursue legal follow-up to their discovery. The Health Ministry was not available for comment on a FranceSoir query regarding the findings.    The authors also deplored ""the fact of not being able to communicate on this vital information"" to their fellow citizens.    On their site, Nakim writes: ""On February 11, 2021, Ynet (the most known Israeli News website) published a confused and confusing article entitled 'Vaccination efficiency data in Israel, and its rapid effects on the young'.    ""Our reanalyses of these data explain why during the massive vaccination project initiated mid-December 2020 during a confinement, daily new confirmed COVID-19 cases failed to decrease as they do during confinements, and, more importantly, why numbers of serious, critical, and death cases increased during that period that covered at least one month. From mid-December to mid-February (two months), 2,337 among all Israeli 5,351 official COVID-deaths occurred. Our analyses indicate orders of magnitude increases in deaths rates during the 5-week long vaccination process, as compared to the unvaccinated and those after completing the vaccination process. Presumably, asymptomatic cases before vaccination, and those infected shortly after the 1st dose, tend to develop graver symptoms than those unvaccinated.    ""The Ynet article is organized in an exciting way and uses data provided in an erroneous way by the Ministry of Health. It is unclear whether this was intentional to prove the vaccine's efficiency or if this was done erroneously because the provided data were misunderstood. Note that in Israel, all vaccines are from Pfizer.    ""The data in the table, rather than indicating the vaccine efficacy, indicate the vaccine's adverse effects,"" the authors conclude.

Il serai intéressant de savoir pour qui Mr Kouts travail en tant que consultant considérant qu'il n'a même pas le besoin de développer son propre site web, ne serait ce pas pour Pfizer par hasard ou peut être carrément Mr Bill gates??dites le nous Mr Kouts nous voulons connaitre vos intérêts pour désinformer?    Mr Kouts a mis entre guillemet mon titre ""ingénieur israélien"" a titre de dénigrement. et bien Mr Kouts je vous joint mon attestation d’étude et de diplômé a l’école polytechnique de Haifa la plus réputé d’Israël et parmi les 100 premières mondiales dans mon domaine.  Inutile de vous préciser Mr Kouts que mon diplôme d’ingénieur en informatique/électronique est parmi les plus difficiles a obtenir au Technion si ce n'est le plus difficile, et je vous invite a juste essayer de passer l'examen pour y être juste accepter et de publier vos résultats sur twitter...          Pour nier la corrélation entre la montée de la mortalité et le début de la campagne de vaccination Mr Kouts écrit:    ""Pour rappel voici la courbe de mortalité COVID19 en Israël, effectivement la 3ème vague est beaucoup plus meurtrière, et pourrait coïncider avec le début de la vaccination en Israël.  En réalité pas vraiment, la vaccination a commencé le 19 décembre, les cas avaient déjà bien commencé à augmenter avant et on sait que c’est exponentiel à partie de là si on ne fait rien.""  Manque de chance Mr Kouts il n y a rien de prévisible dans une épidémie c'est le prof Raoult qui le dit et pour preuve que vous avez tord je vous ramène deux graphes l'un montrant que le 19.72020 il y a eu un pic de 76 malades dans un état grave qui a ensuite décliné et qui ne représente en rien un pic d’épidémie          et de la mème façon les 68 malades graves en date du 19.12.2020 date du début de la vaccination ne représentait absolument pas un signe de début de pic d'autant que c'est moins que le 19 juillet et que de plus nous étions en plein hiver.      Par contre la montée fulgurante de la mortalité immédiatement après le début de la vaccination conforte nos dires concernant la toxicité du ""vaccin"" de Pfizer.    Mr Kouts qui ne comprend rien aux chiffres manifestement, continue comme suit  ""Revenons à l’article, il s’intéresse donc à lier l’augmentation des morts par le vaccin, qui induirait du COVID19 (ou un autre truc idiot comme ça). Il aurait tué 40 fois plus dans la même période que la COVID19 elle-même.  Comment ils calculent ça ? Facile on prend une période avec moins de morts (tous les mois de mars jusqu’à début décembre), qu’on compare au mois le plus meurtrier de la pandémie en Israël (véridique, c'est sa méthodologie...).  (Remarquez qu’on passe de 3,5 fois à 40 fois on sait pas trop comment – 40 fois ça voudrait dire 334 * 40 = 13360 en un mois à comparer avec la mortalité totale en Israël qui est de 45 000 annuellement… n’importe quoi donc)""    gros mensonge puisque nous avons comparés les chiffres de mortalité a rien d'autre qu'au tableau rouge ramenè par Ynet, sur lequel ils se sont basé pour démontrer l’efficacité du vaccin de Pfizer en précisant bien que ce tableau parlait de comparaison sur 5 semaines.    Mr Kouts continu ses élucubrations en disant pas moins:  ""C’est donc évidemment totalement débile d’utiliser VAERS pour les cas en israël (pas la même population, densité, comorbiditsé…) ni les mêmes façon de vacciner selon les pays, ni les mêmes vaccins""    Mr Kouts il serait plutôt ""débile"" de ne pas comprendre qu' a été l'usage que nous avons fait des données du Vaers, les données américaines nous ont été utiles pour déterminer le rapport de la mortalité entre les ages du vaccin de Pfizer. Cette donnée n'est pas dépendante d'un pays quelconque. Mr kouts a de nouveau prouvé qu'il n'aurait jamais réussi les examens pour être admis au Technion, ne parlons pas d'y obtenir un diplôme.    continuons Mr Kouts qui a la technique du matraquage d'inepties pour fatiguer ses lecteurs passent ensuite enfin au grand tableau de Ynet avec les données.    ""On voit sur +60 ans 636 morts au total, mais surtout on voit que la grande majorité intervient dans les 13 jours après la première dose. Cela prouve donc l’efficacité du vaccin (qu'il ne veut pas voir)  Mais non, lui voit quoi ? Que le vaccin a tué 646 personnes et mis à l’hôpital 865 !  Voici son explication qui pour lui montre que c’est dû au vaccin pour l’hôpital""    Mr Kouts qui ne comprend absolument rien a la mortalité du covid voit dans le fait que les morts arrivent dans les 13 jours suivant la première dose la preuve de l’efficacité du vaccin, grave erreur Mr Kouts comme le prouve les rapports du Vaers sur le vaccin de Pfizer les morts tombent en moyenne dans les 4 jours suivant le vaccin.  De plus Mr Kouts la mortalité normale de gens testés positifs au Covid est bien inférieur a 1% cela incluant les vieux de plus de 80 ans, alors que dans le tableau sur lequel vous aussi vous vous appuyez pour vanter les mérites de Pfizer la mortalité globale est de 1.5 pourcent (660 pour 43871) alors que comme décrit durant l'interview les gens de plus de 80 ans qui représente 37% de la mortalité du covid en Israël n'y figurait pratiquement pas car vaccinés des la fin décembre et que le tableau est daté du 10 février. De plus les 1251 malades graves ou critiques du tableau et qui font parti intégrante de l’échantillon de 43871 vaccinés vont eux aussi malheureusement fournir leurs quotes parts de mortalité supérieur a 20% d'entre eux. cela nous amenant a une mortalité supérieur a 2% sur les 43871 vaccinés soit au minimum 3 fois supérieur a celle de gens non vaccines incluant les + de 80 ans alors que le tableau de Ynet ne les incluaient pas.    De plus Mr Kouts fait abstraction des morts subites (cardiaques, AVC) suite au ""vaccin"" de Pfizer qui ne sont pas comptabilisées comme des décès Covid.      pour terminer l'embrouille, Mr Kouts nous ramène au début de la video sur le VAERS et nous dis:  ""(sur la vidéo france soir ils comparent les morts vaccins covid en janvier 2021 VS tous les autres vaccins en janvier 2020 - les 2 sans aucune base et source - enfin c'est pas clair et ils sont pas d'accord entre eux)""    gros mensonges supplémentaires que voila, alors que nous parlions du Vaers pour signifier l’énorme nombre de décès rapportés en Janvier 2021 aux états unis pendant la vaccination pfizer/Moderna de 456 décès sur 3000 rapports comparés a seulement 14 décès en Janvier 2020 sur un nombre similaires de rapports concernant des vaccins classiques.    en Résumé Mr Ari Kouts fait parti des innombrables Troll que je côtoie sur facebook diffusant de la désinformation. au vu du nombre de Tweet mensonger de ce monsieur il me semble qu'il était grand temps de lui clouer le bec.    (Mr Kouts je vous laisse debunker les innombrables fautes d'orthographes et de ponctuation de ma réponse, vous m'excuserais mais vous ne valez pas la peine que je les corrige)      _________________  הצטרפו לקבוצה של נקים בטלגרם לקבל עדכונים ולשתף.  https://t.me/Nakim_org_News  ולערוץ של נקים בטלגרם להתעדכן:  https://t.me/Nakim_org_Ch      הסקר קובע: רוב הציבור בישראל סבור שהשחיתות פוגעת בחייו היום יומיים,  חתום על העצומה נגד שחיתות הממסד ומערכת המשפט והצטרף ל""נקים""    ניתן להשיג את חיים יטיב הדובר של ארגון ""נקים"" באמצעות טלגרם @HaimYativ או דוא""ל  ניתן להשיג את חיים יטיב הדובר של ארגון ""נקים"" באמצעות טלגרם @HaimYativ או דוא""ל haim@nakim.org    השופט מישאל חשין:המלחמה בשחיתות היא מלחמה להגנה עצמית בה לא לוקחים שבויים  השופט מישאל חשין:המלחמה בשחיתות היא מלחמה להגנה עצמית בה לא לוקחים שבויים _________________הצטרפו לקבוצה של נקים בטלגרם לקבל עדכונים ולשתף.ולערוץ של נקים בטלגרם להתעדכן:  חיים יטיב              הצטרף: 23 ינו' 2006  הודעות: 914  דובר של `נקים`הצטרף: 23 ינו' 2006הודעות: 914    פורסם: שישי 05.03.21 19:04 נושא ההודעה: Jean-François Cliche débunké ou Le Soleil ouuuust a l’ombre    Jean-François Cliche débunké ou ""Le Soleil"" ouuuust a l’ombre    Un nouvel essai de débunkage de nakim.org et cette fois de Mr Soleil. (son article est également joint plus bas en PDF au cas ou...)    Comme je l’ai écris avec Mr Kouts plus haut quand il s’agit de santé publique je suis sans pitié donc Mr Soleil désolé pour ce qui va suivre.    Je n’ai pas réagis tout de suite car j’étais occupé et grand bien m’en a pris car l’article de Mr Soleil a été repris ici devinez par qui ? par MSN network oui !!! le réseau de Microsoft celui de B I L L G A T E S du coup d’une pierre deux coups !    J’étais donc occupé a débunker ici l’article pseudo-scientifique du New England Journal of medicine de mes concitoyens Israéliens ventant les qualités du « vaccin » Coco-vide de Pfizer voir ici, oui oui ceux la même qui avouent toucher des subventions de Pfizer pour leur «bons et loyaux » services a la science. Donc après avoir démontrer avec le Dr Seligmann que leur papier scientifique et aussi neutre et fiable qu’une pub de Pfizer nous pouvons enfin passer a Mr Soleil qui a lui aussi tenter de nous « éclairer » sur les mérites de l’injection d’ARN expérimentale de Pfizer (désolé de ne pas l’appeler vaccin mais notez que je me suis retenu par respect pour vous d’écrire poison ).    Mr Soleil commence mal en traitant Nakim de « site avec des contenus à forte teneur conspirationniste » Mr Soleil qui détient la vérité première qui lui a probablement été transmise par Bill Gates en personne a appris l’hébreu et le droit israélien en deux temps trois mouvements et s’est également spécialisé sur le sujet de la corruption en Israël et du haut de son génie nullement égalé s’est déjà permis de jauger les actions juridiques et autres de NAKIM à la cours suprême en Israël cités maintes fois par la presse israélienne et a nous traiter de conspirationniste a deux balles… bon ok avec le Soleil on ne discute pas…    Après avoir rabaissé le support c’est au tour des auteurs :  « L’auteur du billet, Haim Yativ, se présente comme un ingénieur » je ne me présente pas comme un ingénieur dommage de ne pas avoir lu avant ma réponse a votre collègue Ari Kouts, je suis ingénieur et diplômé de pas n’importe quelle école un ptit coup d’œil au dessus chez Kouts votre altesse…  Quand au Dr Seligmann il n’est pas un médecin distribuant des médicaments comme le conçoit Mr Soleil mais c’est un biologiste chercheur ayant publié plus de 100 articles scientifiques et ayant travaillé des années chez le Prof Raoult, bref a la pointe dans le domaine.    Mr Soleil continue donc bien lancé avec ses inepties et nous raconte des « histoires de pomme et d’orange » :  « Le hic, cependant, c’est qu’il compare des pommes avec des oranges : le nombre de patients dans un état grave est un «instantané» qui ne concerne qu’une seule journée alors que le tableau de Ynet cumule des cas survenus sur une assez longue période (au moins deux semaines, voire plus). Pour s’en faire une idée, on n’a qu’à songer au fait que le tableau de Ynet fait état de 660 décès alors que la COVID-19 tue environ 35 personnes par jour depuis un mois. On ne peut donc absolument rien tirer d’une telle comparaison. »    Mr Soleil qui lit ce qui l’arrange a apparemment omis dans l’article la phrase :  “For that purpose we need first to understand that the provided table describes the state of COVID-19 patients that got the first or the second vaccine dose at given dates, as started in the article ""…emerges from the data that among 856 patients above 60 years in serious state hospitalized at this time…"" we assume that the article published February 11 reflects the situation in hospitals the previous day, hence February 10 2021, or February 11 2021.”    Le tableau nous décrit donc clairement le nombre de gens hospitalisés a la date de l’article et pas accumulé comme le prétend Mr Soleil, en cas de doute Mr Soleil qui comprend si bien l’hébreu comme dit plus haut aurais pu se pencher sur la version israélienne qui est sans appel « kaet » est en hébreu a l’instant présent.    Quand au nombre de décès il est bien évidemment accumulé comme nous l’avons bien décrit dans l’article.    Maintenant sûre de lui Mr Soleil s’arme de chiffre de la banque mondiale pas moins (dis moi qui tu fréquente je te dirais qui tu es…) pour nous dire que la mortalité de 0.05% pour 5 semaines est à peine plus élevé que la mortalité attendue de 0.048%    Le paramètre qu’oublie notre prétendu critique scientifique c’est notre phrase: "" This death rate relates mainly to a relatively young population whose vaccination stated on January 19, a period during which most vaccinated were below 65.""    Qui explique donc pourquoi ce chiffre de mortalité est excessif puisque la part du lion de la mortalité en Israël comme dans tout autre pays est compose des gens de plus de 65 ans et pas le contraire.    De plus et essentiellement la mortalité de 0.5% par an ramenée par Mr Soleil est la mortalité globale toute cause confondue incluant suicide accident de voiture cancers, attaque cardiaque et autre, alors que l’année passée la part du Covid dans cette mortalité était de bien moins de 10%. Tant et si bien qu'une mortalité que de Covid qui dépasse la mortalité générale habituelle sur cette période de 5 semaine et cela pour une écrasante majorité de gens de moins de 65 ans cela est une CATASTROPHE.    Mr Soleil continue avec ses élucubrations sous le titre « –la pire vague » expliquant que la hausse de la mortalité en décembre a février est juste causée par la monte des cas Covid. Manque de pot pour la lumière émanant du cerveau de Mr Soleil, nous avons débunké l’article du New England Journal Of Médicine et au passage nous avons glané la preuve de nos dires de leurs propres données. La première injection de Pfizer multiplie par 3 le nombre de malades Covid chez les vaccinés. Maintenant que je vous ai mis a l’ombre Mr Soleil, Je vous invite a lire notre article, puisque faute d’emploi vous aurez tout le temps de réfléchir a vos actes d’avoir encouragé les gens a se faire vacciner avec ce produit plus qu’inquiétant.    Quand a votre final et votre verdict vous savez maintenant quoi en faire au vu de notre débunking de  L’article scientifique sur lequel le ministère de la santé israélienne et vous-même vous vous basez.

Pearson  No Comments  0  SHARES  SHARE ON FACEBOOK  SHARE ON TWITTER  Advertisements    By Niall McCrae-    Anyone raising concern about the safety of Covid-19 vaccines faces derision as an ‘anti-vaxxer’, but the real extremists are those who refuse to hear evidence that something is going badly wrong with this mass experimental intervention. Now a Public Health England  Advertisements    report confirms that infections increase during the fortnight after vaccination.    As the vaccination programme began in earnest in January, worrying signs came from care homes, where many of the initial target population of people aged over 80 reside. At Pemberley House in Basingstoke, a third of the residents (24) died of Covid-19 in a home that had previously been free from the disease. Similar reports emerged from Germany.    The clearest indications came from small countries that strove to vaccinate their entire adult population. The British enclave of Gibraltar was supplied with the Pfizer vaccine on 16th January and the elderly were swiftly jabbed. Suddenly this tiny state, home to 33 thousand, had the worst Covid-19 morality in the world (now 2761 per million). From merely 9 deaths in December, now almost a hundred have died. The health minister angrily denied claims that the vaccine was killing people, but eventually admitted that some deaths had occurred in recipients.    The United Arab Emirates received large batches of the Chinese Sinopharm vaccine as well as the Pfizer product in December. As stated by Amer Sharif, head of the Covid-19 Command & Control Centre in Dubai, the UAE aimed to be the first country in the world to achieve 100% vaccination of eligible adults. An increase in deaths was attributed to mutant strains, but as in other countries the rate rose disproportionately in the vaccinated age band. On 10th February a new daily high of 18 deaths from the coronavirus was recorded, and the trend has continued. Considerably more people are dying than in the first wave last spring – despite the hubristic inoculation.    More evidence of iatrogenic harm came from Israel, which started vaccinating on 19th December. As reported by former New York Times journalist Alex Berenson, while Covid-19 mortality escalated among Israelis throughout January, in Palestine it declined steeply after a surge in December. Yet the Palestinians had no vaccine.    This correlation is more than coincidental. Analysis    of Israeli health ministry data by Hervé Seligmann at Aix-Marseilles University indicates that about 40 times more elderly people died of Covid-19 in the three weeks between their first and second doses than among those who were not vaccinated. Sacrificial lambs? Deaths in Israel are now falling, which politicians and media attribute to the vaccine, although there is a global trend of the virus becoming less deadly.    The mortal complication has a temporal pattern that varies between countries, apparently depending on when vaccination started. Jordan was supplied with 3800 tons of Sinopharm on 9th January, after approval for ‘emergency use’. The King of Jordan and other prominent figures were shown on television receiving the vaccine, to encourage the people to follow. A deal was also struck for 2.2 million doses of the Pfizer product. At this time nearly four thousand had died of Covid-19.    By the end of February half a million had been jabbed, but this was slow progress in a land of ten million. Meanwhile coronavirus cases had surged, as had deaths. A night curfew was imposed. Yet most of those dying were in the age group prioritised for the vaccine; many would have had the supposedly life-saving substance. Yesterday another 37 died, and the death toll is now approaching five thousand. Perhaps that explains hesitancy in the Hashemite kingdom.    It should not be unexpected that Covid-19 vaccines have deleterious as well as intended effects. Pfizer data shows significant lymphocyte depletion in the first week after vaccination. June Raine, chief of the UK medicines regulator MHRA, acknowledged that ‘a week or two’ is needed to build up immunity after the first jab.    The Public Health England study, which was hailed by health secretary Matt Hancock for the reported 80% decrease in hospitalisations, actually showed a 48% rise in infections after the first dose of Pfizer and Astra Zeneca vaccines. The authors, however, blamed this on a higher risk of exposure. Mary Ramsay, head of immunisations at PHE, stated that ‘this adds to growing evidence that the vaccines are working to reduce infections and save lives’. She glossed over the hundreds who died after getting the jab.    This is what may be happening. Vulnerable people who unknowingly had Covid-19 or whose immune system was keeping it at bay, succumbed to the disease after the vaccine lowered their immunity. The virus struck hard, leading to sever symptoms, cytokine storm and pneumonia. It is also possible that previously shielding persons were cross-infected by the vaccinators.    This needs proper scrutiny, not reckless denial by those who are meant to protect us. This defensiveness and censorship is how the thalidomide scandal arose. The authorities have apparently cast aside everything we have learned about ethical safeguards in clinical and experimental treatment. Perhaps it is relevant that the British medicine regulator is heavily funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.    Why aren’t doctors raising the alert? In medical training, hardly a day is given to learning about vaccines, and Big Pharma has undue influence on this noble profession. With critical thinking and dissent stifled by the Covid regime, most doctors are mere conformists. We must appeal to the brave few medics to continue their efforts to expose the deadly hazard of this highly dubious intervention.

(his article is also attached below in PDF in case Mr Soleil and Bill Gates' MSN/Dan Satherley will retract...) As I wrote with Mr. Kouts above when it comes to public health I am ruthless so Mr. Soleil sorry for what follows.    I didn’t react right away because I was busy and it was very good for me because Mr. Soleil’s article was picked up, guess by whom? by MSN network yes !!! !!! the Microsoft network that of B I L L G A T E S!!! with one stone two birds!      So I was busy debunking here the pseudo-scientific article of the New England Journal of medicine of my fellow Israelis touting the qualities of Pfizer's Coco-vid “vaccine”, yes yes those same who admit receiving grants from Pfizer for their “good and loyal” service to science.    So after having demonstrated with Dr Seligmann that their scientific paper is as neutral and reliable as a Pfizer ad, we can finally move on to Mr Soleil who also tried to ""enlighten"" us on the merits of the experimental RNA injection from Pfizer (sorry not to call it a vaccine but note that out of respect for you I refrained from writing poison).    Mr. Soleil starts badly by treating Nakim as a ""site with high conspiracy content"" Mr. Soleil who holds the primary truth which was probably transmitted to him by Bill Gates in person learned Hebrew and Israeli law in two days and has also specialized in the subject of corruption in Israel and from the height of his unparalleled genius has already taken the liberty of gauging the legal and other actions of NAKIM at the Supreme Court in Israel cited many times by the Israeli press and to treat us as a double-barreled conspirator ... well, ok with the Sun, we don't argue ...      After lowering the medium, it's the authors' turn: ""The author of the post, Haim Yativ, presents himself as an engineer"" I do not present myself as an engineer too bad not to have read before my answer to your colleague Ari Kouts, I am an engineer and a graduate of not just any school but the Technion, a little glance above at my Kouts debunking your highness ...    As for Dr Seligmann, he is not a doctor distributing drugs as Mr Soleil conceives, but he is a research biologist who has published more than 100 scientific articles and who worked for years with Prof Didier Raoult, in short at the cutting edge in the field.    Mr. Soleil therefore continues well with his ineptitude and tells us ""stories of apple and orange"": ""The problem, however, is that he compares apples with oranges: the number of patients in serious condition is a 'snapshot' which concerns only one day while the Ynet table accumulates cases that have occurred over a fairly long period (at least two weeks, or even longer). To get an idea, one only has to think of the fact that the Ynet table shows 660 deaths as COVID-19 has killed around 35 people a day for the past month. So absolutely nothing can be drawn from such a comparison. ""    Mr. Soleil, who reads what suits him, apparently omitted from the article the sentence: “For that purpose we need first to understand that the provided table describes the state of COVID-19 patients that got the first or the second vaccine dose at given dates, as started in the article""… emerges from the data that among 856 patients above 60 years in serious state hospitalized at this time… ""we assume that the article published February 11 reflects the situation in hospitals the previous day, hence February 10 2021, or February 11 2021.""    The table therefore clearly describes the number of people hospitalized at the date of the article and not accumulated as claimed by Mr. Soleil, in case of doubt Mr. Soleil who understands Hebrew so well as said above could have looked into the Israeli version which is without appeal ""kaet"" is in Hebrew at this day.  As for the number of deaths, it is obviously accumulated as we have described in the article.    Now sure of himself, Mr Soleil is armed with data from the World Bank no less (tell me who you frequent I would tell you who you are ...) to tell us that the mortality of 0.05% for 5 weeks is barely higher than the expected mortality of 0.048% The parameter that our alleged scientific critic forgets is our sentence: ""This death rate relates mainly to a relatively young population whose vaccination stated on January 19, a period during which most vaccinated were below 65."" So that explains why this death figure is excessive since the lion's share of mortality in Israel as in any other country is made up of people over 65 and not the other way around.  In addition and essentially the mortality of 0.5% per year reported by Mr Soleil is the overall mortality from all causes including suicide, car accident, cancer, heart attack and other, while last year the share of Covid in this mortality was far less than 10%.  So much so that a mortality from Covid which exceeds the usual general mortality over this period of 5 weeks and that for an overwhelming majority of people under the age of 65 this is a CATASTROPHE.    Mr Soleil continues with his rantings under the title ""- the worst wave"" explaining that the increase in mortality in December to February is just caused by the rise in Covid cases. unluckily for the light emanating from Mr. Sun's brain, we debunked the New England Journal Of Medicine article and in the process gleaned evidence for our claims from their own data. The first injection of Pfizer multiplies by 3 the number of Covid patients among the vaccinated.    Now that I have put you in the shade Mr Soleil, I invite you to read our article,since for lack of employment you will have all the time to think about your acts of having encouraged people to be vaccinated with this product more that worrying.    Concerning your final and your verdict Mr Jean-François Cliché aka Mr Soleil, you now know what to do with it given our debunking of the scientific article you, Bill Gates' MSN, Dan Satherley and the Israeli Ministry of Health rely on.      concerning your peer Dan Satherley who wrote in addition to your false claims:    ""Another claim in the post is that deaths from COVID-19 in Israel are now slowing because the vaccination campaign is ""losing its momentum"". This is demonstrably false - since mid-January, the number of people dying from COVID-19 each day has more than halved, while vaccination data shows the number of doses administered in Israel has continued its upward trajectory over the past two months, with no signs of slowing down.""    Mr Satherley seems as well specialized in disinformation since we wrote in feb 15.2021:  ""The decrease in vaccinations and in vaccination age will cause a decrease in serious cases""  so from mid january it start getting down because from mid january the 65 and below start being shot with the pfizer RNA experimental product.    if we take a look to what happens since our article in Israel we can see that there was a decrease of serious case of 30 percent that match the decrease of the first shot vaccination rate:  decrease of serious case from 1008 on feb,15 2021 to 710 on march,6 2021      decrease of the vaccination on last 3 weeks  the dark green is the first shot        In conclusion: LeSoleil/Jean-François Cliche+Msn/Dan Satherley=Bill Gates=FAKE NEWS for pushing people to take the shot.

This find occurs only days before the Senate’s audit of the county’s 2020 election results is due to start.  For months the Board of Supervisors in Maricopa County have blocked and delayed any independent audit performed by the Arizona Senate of the County’s results in the 2020 Presidential election. As we’ve reported previously, after being subpoenaed by the Arizona Senate and then suing the Senate to prevent a Senate audit of their 2020 election results, the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors (MCBOS) agreed to have an audit if they could pick the auditors. The two firms they picked they claimed were the only two who were certified by the governmental body the US Election Assistance Commission (EAC). However, we found that these firms were not certified at the time they were selected by the MCBOS:  The MCBOS went ahead and hired the firms they wanted to perform their audit but the audits were never structured to find any suspected fraud in the county. The validity of the 2 million ballots in the county was never even considered in the programs reportedly used by these audit firms:  TRENDING: BREAKING: Supreme Court Dismisses President Trump and Attorney Lin Wood's Final Election Challenge Without Comment  This is probably why these audits were set up the way they were (so no fraud would be identified). The auditors came to Phoenix and performed their work and some patriots found out that they could be observed on cameras in the facility where they were doing the work. These patriots watched and even sent a couple of individuals down to the center to check things out late one night. These individuals were greeted with a network that was labeled “f##k you”.  And as we reported, the audits were unprofessional in other areas as well:  This is when the Arizona Senate said enough and passed a bill that would grant the Arizona legislature the authority to subpoena election records like ballots and tabulating equipment and ignore any laws to the contrary.  The Senate is now in the process of selecting an auditor(s) to perform their audit. As the day for their audit approaches the heat must have gotten too hot for those guarding the ballots in Maricopa County.  Per our source on the ground in the County, yesterday an individual went by the Maricopa County Tabulation and election center and found doors wide open with seeming uninhibited access to the facility.  Today some other interested individuals in the county stopped by the same facility and found huge piles of ballots in the dumpster outside the facility.  Someone ordered the ballots be shredded.  We do not yet have the complete information on the shredded ballots.  This is not the first state where we found shredded ballots after the election. This also occurred in Georgia, another state where Biden won by a very slim margin.  What a mess. The corrupt FBI won’t investigate obvious crimes. The corrupt media won’t report them. The communist-leaning Democrats cover them up.",BREAKING EXCLUSIVE: Ballots In Arizona’s Maricopa County Found Shredded and In Dumpster – Days Before Senate Audit To Begin,false

US Navy SEALS loyal to Donald Trump raided Hillary Clinton’s Chappaqua, NY estate and arrested her on charges of treason, destruction of government property, and aiding and abetting the enemy, Real Raw News has learned.  The arrest happened on Tuesday night, according to a source in Trump’s orbit, only hours after Trump had spoken to Rear Admiral Hugh W. Howard at US Special Operations Command and given him a “mammoth trove” of evidence of Clinton’s criminality dating back to her days at the State Department. The evidence allegedly includes thousands of never-before-seen emails, which Clinton acid washed prior to the 2016 presidential election, as well as documents implicating her in plots to assassinate Republican legislators across the country.  The evidence was so compelling, our source added, that Adm. Howard had trouble believing that Clinton wasn’t arrested years ago.  “Trump’s been wanting to get her, and the rest of the Deep State cabal, ever since he set foot in the White House. It has taken him years to dig up the motherload. Once he had military support, he greenlit the operation. Trump’s team, for lack of a better word, had been surveilling Clinton a long time, and he knew she was always alone on Tuesday nights. That’s when the SEALS nabbed her,” our source said.  Under cover of darkness, an eight-man detachment from Naval Special Warfare Group 3 infiltrated the Chappaqua mansion shortly after 2:00am. Mysteriously, Clinton’s two-man Secret Service detail, which normally lives in a guest house on the property, was absent that morning. The SEALS cleared the main building, then silently breached the door to her bedroom, where they found her awake rehearsing a speech before a vanity mirror. They fired a single tranquilizer dart into her neck, our source said, before taping her mouth and sealing a black cloth bag over her head.  The SEALS also seized several laptops and reams of paper, our source said.  “I don’t know where they took her; only Trump knows that. But this is proof that Trump and the military have started taking out the cabal. It took him longer than expected, longer than he wanted, but better late than never. Trump is doing what’s right for America,” our source said.  Trump will soon send her to Guantanamo Bay to face a military tribunal for her crimes against America and its people. GITMO, our source said in closing, is run by the Marine Corps. and the US Navy, both of which have forsaken Joe Biden and instead pledged to help Donald Trump vanquish the forces of darkness that have enshrouded the nation in corruption for decades.

408,68892123898958173393740311512537889014,"Following in the footsteps of his mentor, Barak Hussein Obama, Joe Biden is preparing to cower to the Iranian Caliphate in the form of a $3 trillion apology for the Trump administration’s assassination of their top General, Qassem Soleimani.  While the assassination was celebrated by democracies worldwide, Democrats in the US accused Trump of showboating, resulting in raised tensions with the Muslim country.  The continuous funneling of cash from US taxpayers to Iran between the Obama, and now Biden administrations, is shameful. While our veterans lay homeless on our streets and our corporations are being threatened with higher taxes, Democrats have decided to fund a known enemy to the US.  This is the very definition of treason. Not even bleeding heart Jimmy Carter sank so low in his dealings with Iran.  The jet, handpicked by Biden’s Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, is a Dassault Falcon 8X. While the Dassault made its name in the military and commercial aircraft space, the larger Falcon jets carved out a niche in the business space due to their impressive range (5,950 nautical miles), a digital flight control system, and an ability to customize the plane’s interiors into 30+ formats depending on usage priorities.  With the versatility to make both long-range and short-range trips courtesy of a tri-jet engine, the Falcon models offer speed, efficiency, and improved comfort. Sources tell us there will be a handwritten note from Biden on top of the cash that will simply say, “Enjoy the cash. Keep the Jet.”  Due to its payload, this flight will take on a particular significance in aeronautic history. It will be the most valuable payload ever transported by aircraft. To bear this grave responsibility, Bilken enlisted retired US Airways pilot Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger, famed pilot depicted by the legendary Tom Hanks in the 2016 blockbuster hit “Sully”.  Sullenberger insisted his longtime personal flight steward Andres Esquer be along for the all-important flight. Esquer famously served an entire Boeing 777 full of rowdy Oasis fans two cocktails each from one single liter of vodka on an international flight from Heathrow to JFK in 1998, a feat that is still mentioned during pillow talk amongst flight attendants and pilots to this day.  He is certified in CPR and BJJ. He is also an amateur pilot, more than capable of manhandling the aircraft should anything unfortunate befall Sully.  The offer of cash as an apology only serves to lessen our standing in the world. The only silver lining here is that it is being delivered by the best America has to offer.",Biden to Send $3 Trillion on Plane to Iran as Apology for Soleimani Assassination,false
409,252517294563298138807623036396190080023,"Michigan now admits after ‘certifying’ the 2020 Presidential election, that more voters should be removed from their voter rolls than there were votes won by Joe Biden in the race. Mixed with other suspected fraud, (like 141,000 ballot drops at 6am the day after the election) all the ballots in this state should be forensically audited to determine the full extent of the election fraud.  There was so much fraud in Michigan in the 2020 election it is difficult to know where to start. There were late-night ballot dumps in Michigan like other states:  There were vans delivering ballots in the early morning after the election under the Detroit TFC Center where votes were being counted:  TRENDING: REPORT: Nikki Haley Tried to Get a Meeting With Trump — But He Shot Her Down  Republicans were harassed and prevented from viewing the ballot counting in the same TFC center the next day.

The stateremoved the names from the voter rolls in late January because the voters no longer live in the state or did not respond to the state’s inquiries about their addresses, according to a Tuesday district court announcement. The state performed the post-election audit during a legal battle with the Honest Elections Project, an election watchdog.  Michigan certified the election results in November claiming Joe Biden won by 154,000 votes.  Michigan’s 2020 election was run by crooks.

An Interim Military US Government was actually running the US and they saw President Biden as a treasonous agent.

Early Mon. morning 25 Jan. between 3 and 6 am a blackout occurred in Washington DC around the White House. According to two separate videos taped at the scene, police and US troops were everywhere in the darkness. Military vans, buses and police cars pulled up to the White House, loaded passengers, took them down the road and across a bridge and then some vans came back empty to do a repeat.

Sadly, our corrupt politicians and mainstream media only relate the bad news.  If you do not have any respiratory symptoms, such as fever, cough, or runny nose, you do not need to wear a medical mask.

Now, as the number of deaths has surpassed 400,000 in the US, Dr. Jensen and lawmakers are calling for an audit of these deaths.  in the US they get $12,000 to $13,000 for patients admitted and testing positive for a COVID-19 diagnoses and another $39,000 again give or take, for those put on ventilators. Those number vary a bit from report to report.  If they have 161 covid patients, they get an extra $70,000 per patient. That one I just found out about via the video. Thank you Dr. Jensen. There should be an audit of deaths world wide, as death certificates were also changed in other countries as well.

By December, eighteen students in the district had taken their own lives; an early-warning mental health system embedded within computers and tablets issued to students for remote learning received 3,100 alerts since schools shuttered their doors last March.  “When we started to see the uptick in children taking their lives, we knew it wasn’t just the Covid numbers we need to look at anymore,” said Jesus Jara, the Clark County superintendent.  “We have to find a way to put our hands on our kids, to see them, to look at them. They’ve got to start seeing some movement, some hope,” Jara said.  Efforts to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 across the country have led to drastic changes in the way children and teens learn and socialize.  Government data show a 24% increase in the number of children who arrived in emergency departments with mental health issues from mid-March through mid-October, compared with the same period in 2019.  Countrywide, tens of millions of students have been thrown into a new distance learning environment that has resulted in many extracurricular activities being canceled. Recreational spaces have closed, sports canceled, and playdates shifted to Zoom calls, resulting in many kids developing mental issues, especially in Clark County.  Clark County administrators had GoGuardian Beacon alert system installed on every device given out to students after the sixth student suicide last year. The system alerted administrators of more than 3,100 cases where a student searched suicide-related material between June and October.  In one instance, a 12-year boy searched “how to make a noose” on his iPad.” Administrators quickly reached out to the boy’s parents as he was about to hang himself.  The alerts have been so disturbing to Jara that he doesn’t sleep near his phone anymore.  “I can’t get these alerts anymore,” said Jara. “I have no words to say to these families anymore. I believe in God, but I can’t help but wonder: Am I doing everything possible to open our schools?”  Dr. Anthony Fauci has called for schools on a countrywide basis to reopen safely.  An indirect consequence of the pandemic and forcing children to learn at home has contributed to a rise of mental health issues and suicides among America’s future generation.

412,166043791354735587277406141730796234990,"New Mexico lawmakers are swiftly on their way toward legalizing the killing of unborn babies in abortions up to birth for years to come.  The Daily Post reports the state Health and Human Services Committee passed House Bill 7 with bipartisan support on Wednesday. The vote was 8-3, and the bill now heads to the state House Judiciary Committee.  The pro-abortion bill would repeal a 1969 statute that prohibits abortions except in cases of rape, incest or threats to the mother’s life. The statute is not in effect because of Roe v. Wade, but if it is repealed, the state would continue to allow unborn babies to be aborted for any reason up to birth even if Roe is overturned.  It also would repeal the only conscience protections for pro-life medical workers in New Mexico. Currently, the law protects doctors, nurses and other medical workers from discrimination if they refuse to abort an unborn baby based on “moral or religious grounds.”  A state Senate committee passed an almost identical bill earlier this week.  However, pro-life leaders and medical workers are pushing back, saying the bill would strip away vital protections for healthcare workers, babies and mothers.  “Regardless of your position on abortion, no one should be forced to participate, to violate her most deeply held principles or the reason she entered the medical field – to save lives,” Catherine Glenn Foster, president of Americans United for Life, told the committee prior to the vote.  Foster said tens of thousands of healthcare providers in New Mexico would lose their conscience rights and they could sue the state for violating their religious freedom.  During a Senate hearing earlier in the week, state Sen. Gregg Schmedes, R-Sandoval, warned that doctors may leave New Mexico if the bill passes.  “Though some of the existing law is unenforceable because of Roe v. Wade, this statute contains important provisions that protect our doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals,” Schmedes said, according to the Los Alamos Reporter. “As a medical doctor, I have heard from many of my colleagues that if they lose these vital conscience protections, they will consider leaving the state which would threaten healthcare access for many New Mexicans.”  But state Rep. Micaela Lara Cadena, D-Mesilla, a sponsor of the bill, argued that the 1969 statute needs to be repealed because it is “outdated and dangerous.”  “Pregnant people and their families deserve continued access to safe and legal abortion,” Cadena said. “By repealing this dangerous statute, we are making sure this ban is never enforceable in New Mexico again.”  The AP predicts the bill will pass the Democrat-controlled state legislature. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a pro-abortion Democrat, also supports it.  But pro-lifers are not giving up hope. Elisa Martinez, executive director of the New Mexico Alliance for Life, urged New Mexico residents to call their lawmakers and urge them to reject the bill.  “The radical abortion lobby seeks to force medical professionals across New Mexico to perform abortions as a matter of ‘access.’ This is not a pro-woman bill but rather, a pro-abortion lobby bill,” Martinez said.  In 2019, a bipartisan group of lawmakers defeated a similar pro-abortion bill in the state Senate. However, many of the Democrat lawmakers who voted against it no longer serve in the legislature.  The bill is similar to laws that passed recently in New York, Vermont, Massachusetts and Rhode Island. New Jersey also is considering a bill to expand the killing of unborn babies in abortions this year.

413,174665973219926192457495383593208019425,"Corbis via Getty Images  Bill Gates, the fourth richest person in the world and a self-described nerd who is known for his early programming skills rather than his love of the outdoors, has been quietly snatching up 242,000 acres of farmland across the U.S. — enough to make him the top private farmland owner in America.  After years of reports that he was purchasing agricultural land in places like Florida and Washington, The Land Report revealed that Gates, who has a net worth of nearly $121 billion according to Forbes, has built up a massive farmland portfolio spanning 18 states. His largest holdings are in Louisiana (69,071 acres), Arkansas (47,927 acres) and Nebraska (20,588 acres). Additionally, he has a stake in 25,750 acres of transitional land on the west side of Phoenix, Arizona, which is being developed as a new suburb.  According to The Land Report’s research, the land is held directly and through third-party entities by Cascade Investments, Gates’ personal investment vehicle. Cascade’s other investments include food-safety company Ecolab, used-car retailer Vroom and Canadian National Railway.  While it may be surprising that a tech billionaire would also be the biggest farmland owner in the country, this is not Gates’ only foray into agriculture. In 2008, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation announced $306 million in grants to promote high-yield, sustainable agriculture among smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. The foundation has further invested in the development and proliferation of “super crops” resistant to climate change and higher-yield dairy cows. Last year, the organization announced Gates Ag One, a nonprofit to advance those efforts.  It is not entirely clear how Gates’ farmland is being used, or whether any of the land is being set aside for conservation. (Cascade did not return Forbes’ request for comment.) However, there is some indication that the land could be used in a way that aligns with the foundation’s values. Cottonwood Ag Management, a subsidiary of Cascade, is a member of Leading Harvest, a nonprofit that promotes sustainable agriculture standards that prioritize protections of crops, soil and water resources.  Gates is not the only billionaire on The Land Report’s list of top private farmland owners. Wonderful Company cofounders Stewart and Lynda Resnick (net worth: $7.1 billion) ranked number three with 190,000 acres. Their farmland produces the goods for their brands including POM Wonderful, Wonderful Pistachios and Wonderful Halos mandarins.  While Gates may be the country’s biggest farmland owner, he by no means is the largest individual landowner. In its list of 100 top American landowners, The Land Report gives the top spot to Liberty Media Chair John Malone, who owns 2.2 million acres of ranches and forests. CNN founder Ted Turner ranked number three with 2 million acres of ranch land across eight states. Even Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is investing in land on a large scale, landing the 25th spot with his ownership of 420,000 acres, mainly in west Texas.",America’s Biggest Owner Of Farmland Is Now Bill Gates,true

In a sweeping secret pardon that includes more than 2,616 BLM “protesters,” Biden gave a big eff you to law enforcement.  Biden’s pardon includes “anyone arrested for protesting in a non-violent manner.” Basically, all they have to do is say “I dint do nuffin” and they’re free to go.  According to the White House, there is no pardon, and the issue of BLM protesters has yet to be addressed at all. According to Communications Director, Art Tubolls, the whole thing has been blown out of proportion:  “More like…made up. There is no pardon for anyone because Trump’s federal goons never actually arrested anyone. They just dropped them off in the morning in front of the closaest Circle K with $2 for a large coffee and a blintz.”  Fact-checkers were quick to point out that Circle K doesn’t sell blintzes.  At any rate, the pardons may not be real to some people, but to those of us who believe Joe Biden is the next coming of the antichrist here to unseat Donald Trump and thrust America into the pits of hell, they’re as real as can be, and we won’t stand for it.  A source close to the President said the pardons may not exist, but that Biden was “very proud” to be able to sign them. Whether or not he signed them virtually or just in spirit remains to be seen.

419,326301478215778777109732332945619136364,"Constitutional Attorney Matthew DePerno is an American hero. Two weeks ago, Michigan 13th Circuit Court Judge Kevin A Elsenheimer agreed to allow Mr. DePerno’s client, William Bailey, and a highly skilled team of IT experts to perform a forensic examination on 16 of the Dominion voting machines in Antrim County. On Monday, Judge Elsenheimer agreed to allow the results of the forensic examination to be released to the public. The results were damning.  THE REPORT:  After the forensic examination of 16 Dominion Voting machines in Antrim, Co., MI, Allied Security Operations Group has concluded that the Dominion Voting machines were assigned a 68.05% error rate. DePerno explained that when ballots are put through the machine, a whopping 68.05% error rate means that 68.05% of the ballots are sent for bulk adjudication, which means they collect the ballots in a folder. “The ballots are sent somewhere where people in another location can change the vote,” DePerno explained. The allowable election error rate established by the Federal Election Commission guidelines is 1 in 250,000 ballots or .0008%.  Based on the Allied Security Operations report, Constitutional Attorney Matthew DePerno states: “we conclude that The Dominion Voting System should not be used in Michigan. We further conclude that the results of Antrim County should not have been certified.  The stunning report was widely criticized by the Democrat Party mainstream media and by the dishonest Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson.  TRENDING: ""Our Motherf*ckin Streets!"" Antifa Terrorists March Through NYC in Riot Gear - Media Silent (VIDEO)  Following the bombshell findings by Mr. DePerno and his team of IT experts, a “risk-limited audit” was ordered by Sec. of State Benson. Constitutional Attorney Matt DePerno was invited to observe the “risk-limiting audit” of Antrim County’s vote that took place yesterday in the Kearney Twp. hall in Bellaire, MI., where 6 officials from the Secretary of State continuously walked around the room observing and correcting the counters who dared to stray from their objectives.  According to Verified Voting: The risk-limiting audit process can be conducted on any set of paper ballots that has a record of the number of ballots cast, how they are stored, and how to retrieve any particular ballot (ballot manifest). For an RLA to meaningfully support confidence in the reported election outcome, the standard is higher, and requires the following:  Paper ballots preferably marked by hand and supplemented with a ballot marking device for those who need to use one.  A deliberate and intentional step for a voter to check the paper ballot for accuracy before casting the ballot (voter verification).  Rigorous ballot accounting and a properly maintained chain of custody of the ballots.  If photographic evidence proves seals on the Dominion voting machines were broken on November 27, how can a “properly maintained chain of custody of ballots” be assured. The answer is, it can’t.  Before her so-called audit was completed, Sec of State Benson explained the purpose of the “risk limited audit” to the media while ensuring the integrity of the elections in Michigan:  “While we know the machine tabulators functioned properly in Antrim, we are conducting this audit to assure the public of what countless officials from both parties at the federal, state and local levels have already confirmed – that this was the most secure election in our nation’s history and the certified results are an accurate reflection of the will of the voters,” adding, “It is time for Michigan, and the nation to once and for all dismiss the meritless disinformation campaign that seeks to undermine the integrity of our election and move forward in support of our collective democracy.”  Mr. DePerno, who acted as an observer to the “risk-limited audit,” doesn’t agree with Ms. Benson about the integrity of Michigan’s election and has provided us with video and photographic evidence to prove that he was again able to debunk her statement about the “most secure election in our nation’s history.”  The first video provided by Matthew DePerno shows a bin of ballots from Mancelona Township, Precinct #1. The bin was delivered to three of the 20 bi-partisan volunteers that included several Antrim Co. city clerks who agreed to assist with the “risk-limited audit.”  Inside the bin, tabulated ballots were mixed in with ballots that were never tabulated, and several blank ballots were mixed in as well. Mr. DePerno referred to the bin of ballots as “an absolute mess!” On December 16, we reported about photographs taken at Mancelona Township’s Precinct #1 on November 27, 2020, that showed both of the security seals on the Dominion Voting machine were missing.  The second video was taken at a table where ballots were being counted in Helena Twp. The volunteers can be seen questioning why there were fewer ballots in the bin than the original number that was recorded in the previous recount? Shortly after asking the question, a male SOS official approached the table with a bag marked “spoiled ballots” and told them to count them. ATtorney Matt DePerno witnessed the unidentified male SOS rep pulling the “spoiled ballot bag out of the bin and delivering it to the volunteers who were “auditing” the ballots. DePerno also witnessed the SOS official telling them to add the “spoiled ballots” to the count.  The third video was taken at a table where the ballots from Central Lake Twp. were being counted. In the video, a male counter can be seen questioning “multiple ballots with the same signature.” According to Matthew DePerno, 138 ballots had write-in-votes where the penmanship was exactly the same.  In the video below, the SOS official can be seen demanding that the counters ignore what they believe is voter fraud and count the ballots.  “We need to do the counts because if we don’t have the counts, then we can’t move forward. And we understand that there is a concern with this precinct—but this is not a time for you to be investigating right now.”  “Did you find something else?” the male counter asks.  “No,” she replies, adding, “So, you need to move forward with the audit, so we can get the numbers, so we can see how many ballots are here.”  The female counter asks, “So when we’re done with the audit, there’s still the opportunity to challenge the fact that we have multiple ballots with the very same signature?” she asks.  “I don’t know if ‘challenge’ is the right word,” the SOS official says.  “But we’re challenging—” the volunteer says.  The male volunteer tells the SOS, “We’ll go ahead and count the ballots moving forward, but we will separate out, and count those— there’s going to be an asterisk, saying ‘these ballots have the same signature.'”  “And again, we know that you have a concern with this precinct,” she tells them, explaining, “That’s not your role at this very moment,” as she continues to push for them to ignore the multiple matching signatures and only count the ballots.  “What I need you to do right now is finish the audit,” she tells them again. Both of the volunteers explain that they are going to make a note of the ballots, to which the SOS official replies, “Again, that is not the process.”  The SOS official implores them to continue to count the presidential ballots.  At no point does the SOS official assure them that the issue of the multiple potentially fraudulent ballots will be addressed, but instead demands that they count them as if they were all legitimate ballots.  In this video, the SOS official can be seen telling the volunteers who are objecting to adding the ballots in question to the vote total, “This is not an investigation right now!”  On December 16, one day after Dominion Voting Systems CEO John Poulos testified in front of the MI Senate Oversight Committee, Mr. DePerno contacted us to say Poulos was incorrect in his statement that the ballots were securely stored. In fact, Mr. Derno provided us with photos showing seals were broken on one of the tabulators. DePerno explained, “In Central Lake, the lock that protects the side data port where you can insert a thumb drive in order to perform a software upgrade, that could change the program, was missing.” He explains, “The missing lock gives the ability of any person, including a voter to change the Dominion Voting machine program.”  Mr. DePerno explained to us that once the seals are broken, and the lock is removed, the integrity of the machines has been compromised. “It definitely showed that someone had accessed the inside of the tabulator, and it no longer represents a secure voting platform,” DePerno said.  The bin (or box) seen in the image below is where the ballots are stored. DePerno explained, “If you remove the tape, it gives you the ability to separate the tabulator from the box that contains the ballots.”  The photo below shows the stack of ballots in Central Lake that were cast for Joe Biden. The ballots that are pulled forward are all ballots that the counters pulled forward after objecting to the legitimacy of the ballots.  Mr. DePerno was stunned by the number of blank ballots that were mixed in with actual ballots, saying that he believes he observed more blank ballots in the recount than there are registered voters in Antrim County.  DePerno told us, “The guidelines from RLA were not followed. What they did yesterday was not an audit under those guidelines. It was a hand recount of the presidential race only and failed to address many of the problems with down-ballot races. Members of the public who assisted in the hand recount were not allowed to ask any questions or question any ballots.

420,75764659884745117165288749870060790421,"Joe Biden’s Inauguration has been cancelled, President Trump would remain in office and the Chinese Communist Party propaganda media outlets of ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox News, CNN and MSNBC would soon be off the airwaves according to President Trump.  “I have invoked the Insurrection Act of 1807 (Section 10 U.S. Code 13 251-255) to address the treasonous rebellion conducted by Democrat and Republican lawmakers, CCP Agents (Chinese Communist Party), FBI, Department of Justice, CIA and others to dismantle the United States of America and it’s Constitution,” President Trump declared on Thursday 14 Jan. “These entities pose a direct threat to national security. I will remain President indefinitely until all domestic enemies are arrested.”  President Trump invoked the Insurrection Act after another assassination attempt on him last Sat. morning 9 Jan. According to his Intel, Chinese Communist Party Agents, the FBI, Department of Justice, CIA and others of the Deep State have – with the help of the Main Stream Media – long been planning to dismantle the US and it’s Constitution.  Of course, none of these treasonous acts have been reported by the corrupt Main Stream Media. Trump had evidence that the MSM was “embedded with CIA and Chinese Communist Party agents whose sole purpose was to direct public opinion toward a Deep State agenda.”  During President Trump’s four years in office he and what has been referred to as the Alliance have been fighting this Cabal – a Satan worshipping force composed of thirteen Satanist Bloodline families out of Italy, the Vatican, UK Monarchy, British M16, Chinese Communist Party, CIA, FBI, Department of Justice, Antifa, Black Lives Matter and certain Republican and Democratic Lawmakers. Another attempt on his life was the last straw.  Since that Sat. 9 Jan. the US has been under an abbreviated Martial Law with President Trump as Commander in Chief and General Flynn in charge of the Military. As such Trump has signed multiple Executive Orders that among other powers, allowed for Military arrests and Tribunals.  Soon to be acted upon were well over 222,286 sealed indictments against political and global elites filed in federal courts across the nation.  https://operationdisclosure.blogspot.com/2021/01/sealed-indictments-as-of-december-31.html#more  By law with the Insurrection Act in effect, Trump would remain President indefinitely until all domestic enemies were arrested. He would soon take down the Main Stream Media.  “I’m drafting an Executive Order to take the following propaganda media outlets off the airwaves: ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox News, CNN and MSNBC. I am also working with the FCC to pull their licenses. We have evidence that all of these media organizations employ agents of the Chinese Communist Party as well as embedded CIA Agents whose sole purpose is to brainwash, hypnotize and direct public opinion toward certain agendas that support the Left and Deep State. These organizations are a threat to national security and virtually nothing they report is actual news.”  It’s no small task to take down the Cabal. Military and Special Forces units have been deploying all over the US in 400+ cities. Right now there were over 15,000 troops in DC according to Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy. Special Forces units have covertly infiltrated Antifa and Black Lives Matter and made silent covert arrests.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4_DNABtptU  That same Sat. 9 Jan. POTUS and the Department of Defense postponed the 20 Jan. Presidential Inauguration. Intel sources claimed that if Joe Biden was not inaugurated there were corrupt-FBI plans to help stage Antifa and BLM violence in DC and at the 50 state capitols from Sat 16 Jan. through Wed. 20 Jan. Biden couldn’t be inaugurated anyway because of the Insurrection Act that demanded Trump remain in office “until all domestic enemies were arrested.”  A corrupt Mass Media has refused to report anything but their Left Wing agenda believed paid for by the CCP. Thus, the President has announced he would soon activate the Emergency Broadcast System (EBS). This was expected during what has been referred to as Ten Days of Darkness, or media outage.  With the EBS everyone would get alerts on their phones, TV, radio and Internet that would override other broadcasts for several hours at a time. The broadcasts would explain the silent war happening across the globe between the Cabal and Alliance.  This week Trump Intel providers Robert David Steele and Juan OSavin explained, “This may not be settled until April 1. Anyone including Fox, who refuses to broadcast the President of the US faces loss of their FCC licenses as well as criminal punitive actions, perhaps a military takeover.”  On Wed. 13 Jan. in an urgent message to the American people President Trump called for peace. Intel sources were reporting that riots were planned in DC and across the nation. He condemned the rioters at the state capitol, as well as a recent assault by Social Media on our Freedom of Speech and then activated military forces to quell unrest.  https://trendingpolitics.com/breaking-president-trump-releases-urgent-video-message-to-the-american-people/  The recent violation of Social Media platforms to censor Freedom of Speech was of concern.

Overnight to Sun. 10 Jan. multiple arrests were conducted, including in Frankfurt Germany – home of the CIA office where Dominion Voting machines illegally changed Trump votes to Biden in the 2020 Election.  Over last weekend French and Russia Alliance military leaders’ Special Force units took out Deep Staters in Italy, Pakistan, Berlin and Paris. By the first of the week they had moved to Iran where they caused Blackouts in order to target global and regional terrorism.  By Tues. 12 Jan. the White House had launched the National Artificial Intelligence Initiative Office. This officially activated Space Force and it’s Quantum Computer that would put us and the world on the Gold Standard, provide a transparent and instantaneous Quantum Voting System for our first Restored Republic Election in March 2021, plus provided the platform for a top secret Global Broadcast Satellite Program that could override all TV screens for President Trump’s worldwide addresses.

421,89243943631742039243839843335316297767,"General David H. Berger, Commandant of the United States Marine Corps., refused House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s request to use the Corps. to safeguard Biden’s Jan. 20 inauguration from Trump supporters and insurrectionists.  A Pentagon source speaking under promise of anonymity told Real Raw News that Pelosi contacted Gen. Berger late Monday night, and she beseeched him to commit 5,000 troops to help ensure a peaceful transition of power and to prevent a repeat of the Jan 6 siege of the Capitol. Gen. Berger, our source said, didn’t understand why Pelosi needed additional soldiers to augment an already impressive force assembled by federal and state officials. That force includes 15,000 National Guard from D.C., Delaware, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island, and an undisclosed number of FBI and DHS agents who arrived in D.C. Sunday night.  Pelosi said she wanted “battle ready” reinforcements because “radicalized Trump supporters and kooky Qanon conspiracy people” were about to converge on D.C. She implored him to reconsider, arguing that it was the general’s patriotic duty to quell uprisings and guarantee Biden’s ascension to the Oval Office.  Her statement made the general explode, our source said.  “Don’t lecture me on patriotism, Madam Speaker. I’ve served this country with distinction for 40 years. I’ve spilled blood for our nation. What have you, a self-serving elected official, done for your country?” Gen. Berger said.  Pelosi further enraged him by saying he was answerable to Congress.  “I answer only to the president, and as I understand it, Donald J. Trump is still president and commander-in-chief. I abide in the Constitution as it was written, not your interpretation of it,” Gen. Berger admonished Pelosi.  Quoting our source, “When her intimidation tactic failed to sway Gen. Berger, Pelosi tried a different tactic: Begging and flattery.”  Pelosi claimed that the National Guard’s “weekend warriors” were ill-prepared to repel an army of “mad Trumpists.” Battle-hardened marines, however, were more capable of defeating “rabble rousers,” she said. “You have the best trained soldiers in the world, and America needs them.”  Gen. Berger was unmoved. The only way Marines would be deployed, he told her, was if President Trump himself issued that order.  “If you want us to help combat his supporters, I suggest you get him on the phone and tell him that. If he orders me to, I will. Otherwise, I suggest you listen really hard to the words escaping your cracked, poisonous lips; they’re tantamount to treason. We don’t work for you,” Gen. Berger allegedly told her.  Please help support alternative media. We follow the truth, wherever it leads. We reject absolutely big-tech and the narrow, dogmatic views of MSM.

IP addresses owned by Chinese telecom enterprise Huawei Cloud and Huawei’s headquarters hacked into IP addresses in Pennsylvania on November 3, 2020, the data analysis shows. A Huawei-owned IP address also hacked an IP address in Michigan.  IP addresses owned by Chinese state-owned telecommunications operator China Unicom also hacked into IP addresses in Pennsylvania on November 3.  IP addresses owned by Chinese internet provider ChinaNet hacked into IP addresses in Nevada on November 3, according to the data analysis.

Aliyun, also known as Alibaba Cloud, “is the cloud computing unit of Alibaba Group,” according to TechCrunch.  Alibaba founder Jack Ma has not been seen for weeks.  An IP address owned by Kaspersky Lab – Moscow hacked into an IP address in Michigan on November 3, according to the data analysis. Kaspersky is a Russian software and cybersecurity firm. Kasperky Lab was co-founded by Eugene Kaspersky and his now-ex-wife, Natalya Kaspersky.  Eugene Kasperky, the CEO of Kaspersky Lab, served in the Soviet military intelligence service and is a graduate of The Technical Faculty of the KGB Higher School, now known as Institute of Cryptography, Telecommunications and Computer Science, part of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation, widely known as the FSB.  Natalya Kaspersky is now the CEO of Russia’s InfoWatch Group and has a reported net worth of $270 million. “Natalya Kaspersky’s Snoop-Proof Phone Helps Putin Thwart Spies,” according to Bloomberg.  President Trump banned Kaspersky from all U.S. government networks when he signed the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). “The ban, included as part of a broader defense policy spending bill that Trump signed, reinforces a directive issued by the Trump administration in September that civilian agencies remove Kaspersky Lab software within 90 days,” Reuters reported on December 12, 2017. “The law applies to both civilian and military networks.” U.S. District Court Judge for the U.S. District of the District of Columbia Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, former Presiding Judge of the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA Court), upheld President Trump’s ban after Kaspersky Labs sued the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.  “Christopher Krebs, a senior cyber security official at the Department of Homeland Security, told reporters that nearly all government agencies had fully removed Kaspersky products from their networks in compliance with the September order,” according to the Reuters report. President Trump “terminated” Krebs in mid-November 2020 after Krebs claimed the 2020 election was the most secure election in history.  An IP address owned by the University of Stuttgart, a research university in Germany, also hacked into an IP address in Michigan on November 3, according to the analysis.  Amazon Data Services in Toronto, Canada owns an IP address that hacked into a Michigan IP address on November 3, according to the analysis.  Dominion Voting Services is based in Toronto. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a major provider of cloud services for U.S. elections.

The FBI, in conjunction with the US Capitol Marshals Service, delivered the warrant to Pelosi’s office to search for “anything and everything pertinent to the investigation into the Deep State shadow government.”  Pelosi, who was already drunk by 9 AM, threw a little temper tantrum and had to be detained “for her own protection as well as those around her.” The warrant was executed and Pelosi was released without incident.  According to the Marshals’ office, they logged 14 boxes of material evidence deemed to be conducive to the ongoing investigation. The Justice Department hasn’t commented, as they’re concerned about leaks from deeply embedded agents from the Obama Administration. The evidence is said to be even more proof that the democrats are the corrupt ones, including some recordings of Hillary Clinton admitting she hired James Comey.  Pelosi may be implicated personally for collusion with a foreign enemy if the ties between the Clintons and Ukraine can be confirmed. There’s also speculation that Pelosi may have had a record of the Uranium One transaction that proves beyond the shadow of a doubt that Hillary sold 20 percent of our country’s nuclear weapons fuel to Russia.

424,125728978820816086347251262105867078431,"During the predawn hours on New Year’s Day, Delta Force operators infiltrated a Biden-controlled stronghold in southeast Ukraine near the port city of Mariupol, according to an anonymous White House Source who said President Trump greenlit the operation following a series of telephone calls to US military commanders and to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.  A Delta detachment, known as 1-SFOD in the Special Operations community, flew from Okinawa Japan to the US Embassy in Kyiv and held position there until Trump cleared the incursion with his Ukrainian counterparts.  Reliable sources said the Trump administration had obtained “credible evidence�? that the Biden family, by proxy, owned a 200-acre estate and office building 50km northwest of Mariupol. On paper the property was owned by Paradigm Global Advisors, a hedge fund firm in which the Bidens have controlling interest. In the late summer of 2006 Joe Biden’s son Hunter and Joe’s younger brother, James, bought the firm. On the first day on the job, they showed up with Biden’s other son, Beau, and three large men and fired Paradigm’s president and 95% of staff, according to a Paradigm executive who was present. After that, much of Paradigm’s overseas ventures went dark but continued to rake in hefty profits despite a conspicuous lack of investors.  In June 2009 Washington Free Beacon writer Thomas Breslin opined the following statement: “Paradigm is hardly a reputable company. The Bidens fired everyone and put their own people in place. The company became nothing less than a slush fund for illicit monies that the Bidens laundered through the place.�?  The Trump administration has spent four years ferreting out the truth behind Paradigm Global Advisors, according to our White House informant.  “After years of digging, Trump finally caught a break. A current Paradigm employee—someone the Biden’s fucked over—came forward with enough evidence for Trump to make this move. I don’t know what specific evidence was presented, but it must have been some heavy-hitting stuff for Trump to call on Delta to take care of it.�?  At 3am on New Year’s Day, three Blackhawk helicopters, including decoy aircraft, airlifted Delta from Kyiv to the drop zone. The team found the office building empty, devoid of life. The unit commander described the building as “frigid,�? as if it had been vacant and without heat for a long time.  “The windows were covered in a hoarfrost glaze, and the place had a catacomb chill about it,�? he was quoted as saying. “Every office had been stripped—no chairs, no desks, no computers, no nothing. No electricity.�?  Although the building was long deserted, Delta found evidence of recent activity within the hacienda attached to the compound. In a kitchen were freshly chopped vegetables and a percolator of lukewarm coffee. Outside, fresh tire impressions led away from the compound. It was as if someone had tipped off the occupants.  But in the hacienda Delta hit paydirt. They seized several laptops and 300 million dollars in gold bullion. They also found crates of Chinese-manufactured Type 56 assault rifles and tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition. Even more disturbing, they found beneath the hacienda a maze of chambers and tunnels that ran for miles in every direction. Ankle and wrist shackles, bolted to the walls in various locations, held bits of necrotic flesh, and in an antechamber, they discovered twelve duffel bags filled with black tar heroin.  On Trump’s order, Delta coordinated with Ukraine’s SBU, that nation’s security agency in counterintelligence and combatting terrorism, to confiscate evidence and await the arrival of State Department personnel.

The reasons for the visits were not recorded, but based on the emails between the two men, we can assume they were for nefarious reasons.  An FBI insider has leaked the extensive visitor logs to Epstein Isle. Several notable names were mentioned in the log, including Bill Clinton, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, and Nancy Pelosi. But the most frequent visitor was none other than Adam Schiff, who visited 78 times over the span of five years.

In America, no one is above the law, except the rich.”  This is truly sickening news, but not unexpected. It was well-known that Schiff and Epstein were in cahoots, but the fact that Epstein was one of the main figures behind the operation was unexpected.

CDC illegally inflated the COVID fatality number by at least 1,600 percent as the 2020 presidential election played out, according to a study published by the Public Health Initiative of the Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge. The study, “COVID-19 Data Collection, Comorbidity & Federal Law: A Historical Retrospective,” was authored by Henry Ealy, Michael McEvoy, Daniel Chong, John Nowicki , Monica Sava, Sandeep Gupta, David White, James Jordan , Daniel Simon, and Paul Anderson. (READ THE LANDMARK RESEARCH HERE)  The CDC is now legally requiring red-blooded Americans to wear face masks on all public transportation as globalists try to push the concept of “double-masking” on the populace. Since the election, the World Health Organization admits that PCR tests are not totally reliable on the first try and a second test might be needed. This corresponds with CDC’s quiet admission that it blended viral and antibody test results for its case numbers and that people can test positive on an antibody test if they have antibodies from a family of viruses that cause the common cold. Hospitals in Florida had so many accuracy complications that Orlando Health had to admit that its 9.4 percent positivity rate got recorded at 98 percent. (READ: The TRUTH About Fauci and Gates And NIH Owning A Stake in the Vaccine).  “The groundbreaking peer-reviewed research…asserts that the CDC willfully violated multiple federal laws including the Information Quality Act, Paperwork Reduction Act, and Administrative Procedures Act at minimum. (Publishing Journal – Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge / Public Health Policy Initiative) Most notably, the CDC illegally enacted new rules for data collection and reporting exclusively for COVID-19 that resulted in a 1,600% inflation of current COVID-19 fatality totals,” the watchdog group All Concerned Citizens declared in a statement provided to NATIONAL FILE, referring to the Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge study.  “The research demonstrates that the CDC failed to apply for mandatory federal oversight and failed to open a mandatory period for public scientific comment in both instances as is required by federal law before enacting new rules for data collection and reporting. The CDC is required to be in full compliance with all federal laws even during emergency situations. The research asserts that CDC willfully compromised the accuracy and integrity of all COVID-19 case and fatality data from the onset of this crisis in order to fraudulently inflate case and fatality data,” stated All Concerned Citizens.  “On March 24th the CDC published the NVSS COVID-19 Alert No. 2 document instructing medical examiners, coroners and physicians to deemphasize underlying causes of death, also referred to as pre-existing conditions or comorbidities, by recording them in Part II rather than Part I of death certificates as “…the underlying cause of death are expected to result in COVID-19 being the underlying cause of death more often than not.” This was a major rule change for death certificate reporting from the CDC’s 2003 Coroners’ Handbook on Death Registration and Fetal Death Reporting and Physicians’ Handbook on Medical Certification of Death, which have instructed death reporting professionals nationwide to report underlying conditions in Part I for the previous 17 years. This single change resulted in a significant inflation of COVID-19 fatalities by instructing that COVID-19 be listed in Part I of death certificates as a definitive cause of death regardless of confirmatory evidence, rather than listed in Part II as a contributor to death in the presence of pre-existing conditions, as would have been done using the 2003 guidelines. The research draws attention to this key distinction as it has led to a significant inflation in COVID fatality totals. By the researcher’s estimates, COVID-19 recorded fatalities are inflated nationwide by as much as 1600% above what they would be had the CDC used the 2003 handbooks,” stated All Concerned Citizens.  “Then on April 14th, the CDC adopted additional rules exclusive for COVID-19 in violation of federal law by outsourcing data collection rule development to the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE), a non-profit entity, again without applying for oversight and opening opportunity for public scientific review. On April 5th the CSTE published a position paper Standardized surveillance case definition and national notification for 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) listing 5 CDC employees as subject matter experts. This key document created new rules for counting probable cases as actual cases without definitive proof of infection (section VII.A1 – pages 4 & 5), new rules for contact tracing allowing contact tracers to practice medicine without a license (section VII.A3 – page 5), and yet refused to define new rules for ensuring that the same person could not be counted multiple times as a new case (section VII.B – page 7),” stated All Concerned Citizens.  “By enacting these new rules exclusively for COVID-19 in violation of federal law, the research alleges that the CDC significantly inflated data that has been used by elected officials and public health officials, in conjunction with unproven projection models from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), to justify extended closures for schools, places of worship, entertainment, and small businesses leading to unprecedented emotional and economic hardships nationwide. A formal petition has been sent to the Department of Justice as well as all US Attorneys seeking an immediate grand jury investigation into these allegations,” All Concerned Citizens stated.

NIAID director Dr. Anthony Fauci, a financial ally of Bill Gates whose institute is part of NIH, has been critical of Hydroxychloroquine and the FBI even raided a health spa serving intravenous vitamin C, which are competitors to a vaccine. (RELATED: Eight NIH Coronavirus Panel Experts Disclose Financial Relationships With Price-Hiking Drugmaker Gilead).  “We do have some particular stake in the intellectual property” for the Moderna vaccine stated Francis Collins, the director of NIH, in a revelatory recent Economic Club panel discussion. “One of the vaccines– the one that’s furthest along– what started, actually, at the federal government in our own Vaccine Research Center at NIH– then worked with a biotechnology company called Moderna to get to where we are now, with very impressive Phase I results and getting ready to go into a large-scale trial as early as July. That one, of course, we do have some particular stake in the intellectual property. Others, though, come from companies who’ve invested their efforts into getting them to the point where they might now be ready for a trial,” Collins stated.  Newly published documents from Public Citizen have massive implications. Public Citizen states:  “The U.S. government may jointly own a potential coronavirus vaccine. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has played a critical role in coronavirus research for years. Building off this work, federal scientists have helped design and test mRNA-1273—a vaccine candidate developed in partnership with Moderna.[2] The federal government has filed multiple patents covering mRNA-1273. In this report, we describe two patent applications that list federal scientists as co-inventors.[3] If the government successfully pursued its patent filings, the resulting patents would likely confer significant rights. We also review recently disclosed contracts between NIH and Moderna. The agreements suggest that NIH has not transferred its rights, but instead maintains a joint stake.”  Journalist Patrick Howley exposes the Coronavirus “Contact Tracing” program in the first-ever episode of NATIONAL FILE TV.

It turns out the firm is a partner of Google, NATIONAL FILE has learned. MTX Group got the contract without conservative Republican Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick being “in the loop” to the decision process, and Patrick is just one of numerous policymakers questioning the company’s deal with the state, which authorizes MTX to serve as virus investigators charting people’s contacts and relationships. MTX has also partnered during the Coronavirus outbreak with New York State and built Contact Tracing technology employed in Georgia. So what’s really going on here? It turns out MTX is bigtime partners with Google:  I reported: Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Centers For Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) policy confirms that “Contact Tracing” data may be sent to the World Health Organization (WHO) and to law enforcement authorities “to place someone under quarantine or isolation.” The Contact Tracing records, stored at the CDC and elsewhere, can also be sent to the Department of Justice, State Department, Department of Homeland Security, congressional offices, and to various medical and legal departments and contractors. Democrats are currently seeking $100 billion in a bill that would authorize grants to conduct contact tracing at people’s homes. Meanwhile, Americans are fearing the political implications of contact tracing, considering that Chelsea Clinton is on the board of trustees of one official contact tracing group that has accepted large sums of money from Bill Gates and George Soros organizations.  HHS records show a System of Records Notice (SORN 09-20-0171) in the Federal Register marking the creation of the record system called “Quarantine- and Traveler-Related Activities, Including Records for Contact Tracing Investigation and Notification…” The records pertain to “Individuals subject to quarantine or isolation orders, ill travelers (i.e., passengers and crew), contacts of ill travelers, and/or individuals exposed or suspected of being exposed to serious communicable diseases.” The records include: “Passenger and crew manifests from conveyances carrying individuals subject to 42 CFR parts 70 and 71, case reports, illness response forms, medical assessments, medical records (including but not limited to clinical, hospital and laboratory data and data from other relevant tests), name, address, date of birth, and related information and documents collected for the purpose of carrying out agency responsibilities under sections 311 and 361-368 of the Public Health Services Act.” The records are being stored at: “Division of Global Migration and Quarantine, National Center for the Preparedness, Detection, and Control of Infectious Disease (NCPDCID), Coordinating Center for Infectious Diseases (CCID), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1600 Clifton Road, NE., Building 16; MS E03, Atlanta, GA 30333.

The March 27 memo written by Joshua D. Lenchus, shortly before he was named chief medical officer this month of Broward Health Medical Center, confirms that the process allows for a “Quarantine Order” to be issued for “Persons Under Investigation” who have not even tested positive. This scoop comes amid public outcry after we exposed Broward County Administrator Bertha Henry caught on tape discussing going into “family homes” and assisted living facilities to isolate people during the Coronavirus outbreak. Freedom protesters wielding petitions were shut out of the Broward Commissioners meeting on Tuesday.  Here is Broward County Administrator Bertha Henry discussing going into “family homes” to isolate people.        HERE IS THE MEMO ISSUED BY JOSHUA LENCHUS: browardorder  SOROS, GATES, AND CLINTONS  Partners in Health was recently selected by Massachusetts governor Charlie Baker to conduct Coronavirus “contact tracing,” a process that involves teams of investigators finding out who infected people have come into contact with. The group is already “training and deploying hundreds of contact tracers.” Some citizens fear the potential for mass surveillance posed by contact tracing, especially in light of a Democrat-introduced bill in Congress to authorize contact tracing “at individuals’ residences.” Partners In Health’s involvement will not assuage many fears, considering the group has received funding from George Soros and Bill Gates organizations and counts Chelsea Clinton on its board of trustees.  Partners in Health lists George Soros’ Open Society Foundations as an official partner, along with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Partners In Health lists Open Society Foundations on its 2015 annual report as a supporter to the tune of $1 million or above, along with the Gates Foundation. Chelsea Clinton serves on Partners in Health’s Board of Trustees, according to its 2019 annual report.  Partners in Health co-founder Paul Farmer’s achievement.org bio notes: “Farmer’s work attracted the support of philanthropists, including George Soros and Bill and Melinda Gates. In 2002, PIH received a $13 million grant from the Global Fund for improvements in the Cange complex. In 2005 the William J. Clinton Foundation funded a Partners in Health AIDS program in Rwanda.” Farmer and Chelsea Clinton did a Clinton Foundation podcast together in 2019.  In response to a 2007 tuberculosis outbreak in Africa, NBC News reported: “Soros’ Open Society Institute announced a $3 million grant to the non-profit organization Partners in Health and Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. The donation will be used to design a model project of community-based XDR-TB treatment in Lesotho. Once treatment guidelines are developed, experts hope the program will be adopted in other poor countries.”  Soros personally announced the grant and said he hoped it would spark a larger project. For this initiative, Partners In Health was cited by name in the propaganda book The Philanthropy of George Soros: Building Open Societies.  In 2011, International Women’s Health Coalition noted, “YP Foundation Founder to Join Paul Farmer, George Soros, at IWHC Gala.” Farmer was honored at the gala, which Guest of a Guest noted had David Rockefeller in attendance.  In 2014, Partners In Health co-founder Paul Farmer secured multi-million dollar Soros financing for a coalition project in Africa. Farmer was featured in an October 2014 video interview on Soros’ Open Society Foundations website, which stated, “In between trips to Liberia, Paul Farmer of Partners In Health visited Open Society’s offices to discuss his work on Ebola. Paul talked about the need to ensure sustainable health systems for people in nations where the virus has spread.” Farmer blasted “fear and conspiracy theories around fatal illnesses” in the video and talked about how to “attack” conspiracy theories with activism.        Forbes reported in September 2014: “There’s never been a connection between Ebola and first-rate medical care,” says Paul Farmer, the renowned co-founder of Partners in Health, before pointing out that none of the health care workers flown back to the U.S. for treatment have died. Could the answer to the outbreak lie in the care regiment for those afflicted?  We’ll soon find out. Farmer landed in Liberia this morning, at the center of a coalition quietly formed to specifically – and quickly – test that thesis. In the next few weeks, the Farmer group will open a top-notch treatment facility in one of Liberia’s most rural provinces, along with strategies designed to maximize its effectiveness.  “This has been coming together for years,” Farmer tells Forbes, a few hours before departing on the trip. “The Ebola crisis pushed it over the edge.”  The impetus for this coalition began with a meeting two weeks ago, convened by Farmer’s co-founder at Partners in Health, Jim Kim, who is now president of the World Bank. Attendees included Director-General Margaret Chan of the World Health Organization, Tom Frieden, Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Francis Collins, Director of the National Institute for Health. Dismayed by the global response – Kim told the group that the outbreak already ranks among the worst health crises in world history — Kim tabbed Farmer as the World Bank’s special Ebola advisor and also enlisted another attendee at the meeting, Raj Panjabi, who runs Last Mile Health in Liberia. (Full disclosure: Panjabi was mentored at last year’s Forbes 400 Summit on Philanthropy and I now chair the advisory board for Last Mile Health, which hires, trains and manages front-line health care workers in remote villages.)  George Soros’ Open Society Foundations quickly provided $4 million to fund this project. “The coalition got us a proposal the next day, they answered all our questions the day after, and we got them the funds they needed before the week was out,” says Chris Stone, the organization’s president. The project was appealing to Soros’ team because it features a local group familiar with the turf, an entrepreneurial mentality and the ability to scale.”  Forbes passage ends  Contact Tracers Exposed https://t.co/vv5pUJXyOo — Patrick Howley (@HowleyReporter) May 11, 2020  Meanwhile…  Prospective Coronavirus contact tracers in New York City are required to understand “institutional and structural racism” and to support immigrants and the LGBTQ community. The government is employing contact tracers to investigate who infected persons come into contact with, leading to civilian concerns that privacy is being attacked. (RELATED: Democrats Introduce Bill To Authorize Contact Tracing At People’s Homes).  A job posting on Columbia University School of General Studies states: “The Fund for Public Health in New York City (FPHNYC), in partnership with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH), is seeking contact tracers to perform case interviews and contact tracing to support the citywide COVID-19 response. using a trauma-informed, culturally respectful approach that builds trust and facilitates the free sharing of information.” The job includes “Conducting in-person investigations into congregate settings and selected cases and contacts.”  Listed requirements include: “Ability to understand the concepts of institutional and structural racism and bias and their impact on underserved and underrepresented communities” and “Have a demonstrated commitment to supporting communities who have experienced systemic oppression and bias (e.g. people of color, LGBTQ people, immigrants, justice involved persons, etc.)”  Democrat Rep. Bobby Rush has introduced a bill in Congress to authorize the federal government to grant approved entities the right to conduct contact tracing for Coronavirus at “individuals’ residences.” Contact tracing involves investigators tracing every interaction that infected people have.  Rep. Rush introduced HR 6666, “COVID-19 Testing, Reaching, and Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act” on May 1, 2020 and it has been referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. The bill has 45 co-sponsors. According to the text of the bill: “To authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services to award grants to eligible entities to conduct diagnostic testing for COVID-19, and related activities such as contact tracing, through mobile health units and, as necessary, at individuals’ residences, and for other purposes.”  People are concerned that the government might be angling to use contact tracing to remove people from their homes and place them in quarantine, after a Ventura County, California health official suggested doing just that (and later walked it back, though it’s unclear what his proposed policy actually is at this time).  WHAT WOULD YOU DO if your six year old son or daughter tested positive for COVID19 and was taken from your home to a quarantine center by Ventura Health Authorities? This SHOCKING VIDEO demands that you plan ahead. #BeBrave #HistoryRepeating pic.twitter.com/e5RC7dCO7o — Del Bigtree (@delbigtree) May 6, 2020  Former Democrat president Bill Clinton extensively discussed contact tracing recently in video interviews with Democrat leaders including governors Andrew Cuomo and Gavin Newsom:  The video I highlighted of Bill Clinton discussing a potential ""Contact Tracer Corps"" was taken down, but here is another version of it that features Bill talking to Cuomo and Newsomhttps://t.co/cr1aDlY8X0 — Patrick Howley (@HowleyReporter) May 9, 2020  CHILDREN AT RISK  Child Protective Services (CPS) agencies are facing national scrutiny as Salem, Oregon salon owner Lindsey Graham accuses CPS of questioning her children in a politically motivated targeting operation. Graham is fighting Democrat governor Kate Brown’s state government in an effort to re-open her business during the government-imposed Coronavirus lockdown. Graham’s crusade, predictably, is making her a target of the political establishment.        I led the way in exposing Child Protective Services with my 2019 investigative journalism series. I spotlighted the massive problems in Oregon, interviewing pro-life activist Heather Hobbs regarding her claim that a nurse targeted her with a vindictive CPS report in the hospital due to her pro-life conservative beliefs, and I showed how the Oregon Treasury invested in a foster care provider accused of lording over patient abuse.  Meanwhile: Washington state’s Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCFY, also known as “CPS” for “Child Protective Services”) posted a job listing for existing CPS workers to volunteer to supervise children in quarantine centers during the Coronavirus outbreak.  The job posting states: “DCYF is seeking current DCYF employees in King, Snohomish, and Benton counties to volunteer to supervise and support children and youth in Emergency Quarantine Centers. While this is a voluntary effort, you will be compensated four ranges (approximately 20%) above you current base salary while performing these duties, and return to your normal position and salary once concluded. We are looking for current DCYF Social Service Specialist 3’s to care for children who are either COVID-19 positive, or who may have been exposed to COVID-19. There are three locations…”  One of the listed locations, Cedar Springs Camp, clarified that they were falsely listed by the state of Washington as a quarantine center, and they asked the state to remove them. The job posting closed on May 11.  Responding to social media uproar, the Washington state’s DCYF put out a clarifying statement that the ad was only referring to children currently in the system. But their clarifying statement contradicts itself, at first stating that the quarantined children will be kids who have tested positive, and then stating that quarantined children will also be kids who may have been exposed to Coronavirus.  DCYF’s clarifying statement reads: “In light of some concerns from the public regarding two recent job postings by the Washington State Department of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF), the agency would like to clarify the intent of these job listings and address misinformation spreading as a result of the job description.  The job postings targeted current staff interested in Social Service Specialist 3 and Social Service Specialist 5 positions. The post prematurely included sites of potential locations in the community where we could house children in our legal care and authority who’ve tested positive for COVID-19 in the event that a placement home was not available. The facilities listed are not affiliated with DCYF and had not signed off on this job listing.  The listings have since been taken down to avoid further confusion.  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, DCYF began internal recruitment of social service specialists to care for foster children who are either COVID-19 positive or may have been exposed to COVID-19 in the event a placement home was not available.  To clarify, those facilities that ultimately open their doors to this effort would only house State-dependent children and youth in out-of-home care who due to being COVID positive or COVID exposed do not currently have a foster home available. These facilities are for this limited scope and not considered quarantine centers or intended for the general public.”  Meanwhile…  Multiple mothers have had their children taken away from them as a direct result of working in the medical profession during the Coronavirus outbreak. Will these disturbing cases register with our political leaders, who are voicing public calls to stand with our medical workers during the pandemic?  Additionally, NATIONAL FILE caught a Child Protective Services worker attempting to use the Coronavirus outbreak to suspend all visits for parents of a child in the government system, citing a statewide policy that the state government says does not exist. What is going on?  (UPDATE: Dr. Theresa Greene, profiled below, got her children back after an appeals court ruling)  The Washington Examiner previously reported:  “A divorced emergency room physician temporarily lost custody of her daughter because of the coronavirus pandemic.  Dr. Theresa Greene, a doctor in South Florida, previously shared custody of her 4-year-old daughter with her ex-husband, Eric Greene, but a judge granted an emergency order granting him sole custody until the ordeal is over, according to NBC Miami.  In the court’s decision, Circuit Judge Bernard Shapiro wrote, “In order to protect the best interests of the minor child, including but not limited to the minor child’s safety and welfare, this Court temporarily suspends the Former Wife’s timesharing until further Order of Court. The suspension is solely related to the outbreak of COVID-19.”…  …Theresa Greene responded to the judge’s ruling by saying that “the family court system now is stressing me almost more than the virus.”  “I was just shocked that the judge would take this stance without talking to medical experts and knowing the facts and take it so lightly, take my child from me, and not think of the effect on her, her mental and psychological well-being,” she added.  The doctor noted that the custody battle will not stop her from following the “oath” she took to help people.”  Washington Examiner passage ends  Greene appealed the decision, and an appeals court ruled in her favor.  Meanwhile, I recently reported:  An Oklahoma medical worker has been stripped of her parental custody at this time because she works in a medical clinic and could possibly be exposed to Coronavirus during the outbreak, according to court documents.  A district judge for the Sac and Fox District Court took medical worker Katherine Spencer’s children after the father petitioned the court. “The Petitioner alleged, and submitted documents in support, that the Respondent alleged proximity to Coronavirus,” the court order states. Court dockets show no record of a hearing on March 20, the day the court laid down its order to confiscate Spencer’s children.  Katherine Spencer told her story on Facebook and denied that she has any history of “neglect” prior to getting hit with a gag order by the judge.  NATIONAL FILE recently reported…  UPDATE: Since NATIONAL FILE broke this story, the parents in question have had multiple short video visits with their daughter)  A Child Protective Services (CPS) worker in Oklahoma used the Coronavirus outbreak to cut off a mother and father’s visits with their 20-month old daughter, even though the Department of Human Services, the state agency that oversees CPS, claims to be keeping parental visits open.  “DHS statewide has suspended all visitations due to the virus so after today’s visit, we cannot approve any more visitations until it is reinstated,” said CPS permanency worker Danelle Dillman in a Friday morning text message to Andrew Ritter regarding his 20-month old daughter, who was seized by the government for “Failure To Thrive” due to low infant birth weight after the girl’s mother chose to breastfeed her. Ritter and his wife said they preferred not to place their daughter on a particular appetite enhancer due to perceived conflict with the girl’s Zyrtec Antihistemine.  An Oklahoma DHS official told National File in a confusing, defensive interview that the state agency does not have a policy in place to suspend all visitations at this time, but rather to continue visitations using technology like Skype and FaceTime. But the official does not know if visitations are actually still occurring. Ritter and his wife never received an offer to hold a cyber-visit. Here is the text that permanency worker Dillman sent to Ritter:  When National File called up the headquarters for Oklahoma DHS, a woman who answered the phone told us that parental visits were indeed “suspended” for the time being, “until they get this virus under control.” The woman refused to give us her name.  But Keeley McEwan, head of the Oklahoma DHS communications office, told National File that “We have not suspended visitation across the board in any way.” She pointed to the agency’s daily guidance for case workers, which she noted is “fluid” and “changes day to day.”  “As of today we are highly encouraging continuing visitation” utilizing iphones and programs including Skype and FaceTime. “Whether a visitation is cancelled is on a case by case basis.”  She did not know whether any visitations have been recently held since the Coronavirus outbreak using Skype or FaceTime. Permanency worker Danelle Dillman did not respond to repeated requests for comment. McEwan did not confirm whether or not she spoke to Dillman or Dillman’s superviser following our conversation.  I have been reporting on the nationwide scourge of CPS removing children from parents’ homes for highly disputable reasons or no reason at all, which many parents feel is due to the for-profit nature of the government’s child removal industry.  BUSTED: FAUCI, BIRX, AND GATES: HERE IS MY ORIGINAL REPORT THAT CHANGED THE WORLD  President Donald Trump is fighting to find a medical solution for Coronavirus in the short term, expressing hope that the anti-malaria drug Chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine can help patients suffering from the Chinese virus.  The truth is that President Donald Trump is locked in an intense power struggle with Bill Gates, who is pushing his vaccines, which may not be available to the public until after November’s election.  Gates has a lot of pull in the medical world, he has a multi-million dollar relationship with Dr. Fauci, and Fauci originally took the Gates line supporting vaccines and casting doubt on Chloroquine. Coronavirus response team member Dr. Deborah Birx, appointed by former president Obama to serve as United States Global AIDS Coordinator, also sits on the board of a group that has received billions from Gates’ foundation. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation recently provided funding to both IHME and Imperial College London, which put out wildly overblown models for the Coronavirus outbreak that caused mass panic and contributed to worldwide government lockdown. Gates is a big proponent for a population lockdown scenario for the Coronavirus outbreak.  National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID, a division of National Institutes of Health, NIH) director Dr. Anthony Fauci, who is represented by the Aurumn Speakers Bureau, initially criticized Trump’s hopeful assessment of Chloroquine, saying in an interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper that “There’s no magic drug for coronavirus right now,” and lectured, “Let me put it into perspective for the viewers .. there has been anecdotal non-proven data that it [chloroquine] works… but when you have an uncontrolled trial you can never definitely say that it works.”  Fauci then changed his tune and launched a public relations campaign huddling closer to Trump. Fauci said that he would definitely prescribe Chloroquine for patients. “Yeah, of course, particularly if people have no other option. These drugs are approved drugs for other reasons. They’re anti-malaria drugs, and they’re drugs against certain autoimmune diseases like lupus. Physicians throughout the country can prescribe that in an off-label way. Which means they can write it for something it was not approved for.”  Fauci makes his hostility toward the Trump-touted drugs clear:  First of all this is a brilliant idea @kilmeade to study how many people that’ve taken hydroxychloroquine long term have contracted #COVID maybe even have them take antibody test. Second of all Fauci doesn’t want it prescribed here but it’s fine if Spain does? pic.twitter.com/hcnRhos13g — Rosie memos (@almostjingo) April 3, 2020  Fauci is pushing the talking point that things will never go back to normal in our society until we have the ability to mass-vaccinate people, echoing Bill Gates’ assertion that mass gatherings in our culture “may not come back at all” before mass-vaccinations.  #NEW: Dr. Anthony Fauci on return to normalcy from pandemic: ""If 'back to normal' means acting like there never was a Coronavirus problem, I don't think that's going to happen until we do have a situation where you can completely protect the population.""pic.twitter.com/JbE7uasbO2 — Jennifer Franco (@jennfranconews) April 6, 2020  Fauci downplayed the threat of Coronavirus on January 21 in a Newsmax TV interview, saying, “This is not a major threat for the people in the United States, and this is not something that the citizens of the United States right now should be worried about.” Since then, Coronavirus has exploded in the United States, boosting demand for a vaccine.  This is Fauci 10 days before Trump's Travel Ban. pic.twitter.com/PU3AuDKctv — Justin Pulitzer Trades (@JustinPulitzer) April 7, 2020  Fauci later said that people would not have to change their daily activities as a result of the Coronavirus outbreak:  It is time to #firefauci Mr. President. The People Demand Ithttps://t.co/J4SSXn1kPB — Patrick Howley (@HowleyReporter) April 12, 2020  But Fauci’s NIAID actually funded a study on Bat Coronavirus, which was a project that included scientists at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, the Chinese lab at the center of controversy over their bat research. That study confirmed in 2018 that humans have died from coronavirus.  Here’s an excerpt from the April 4, 2018 NIAID website entry entitled “New Coronavirus Emerges From Bats in China, Devastates Young Swine”: “A newly identified coronavirus that killed nearly 25,000 piglets in 2016-17 in China emerged from horseshoe bats near the origin of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which emerged in 2002 in the same bat species. The new virus is named swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV). It does not appear to infect people, unlike SARS-CoV which infected more than 8,000 people and killed 774. No SARS-CoV cases have been identified since 2004. The study investigators identified SADS-CoV on four pig farms in China’s Guangdong Province. The work was a collaboration among scientists from EcoHealth Alliance, Duke-NUS Medical School, Wuhan Institute of Virology and other organizations, and was funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health. The research is published in the journal Nature. The researchers say the finding is an important reminder that identifying new viruses in animals and quickly determining their potential to infect people is a key way to reduce global health threats.”  Additionally, the Daily Mail reported that National Institutes of Health, of which Fauci’s NIAID is a member, provided a $3.7 million grant to the Wuhan Institute of Virology to study bat-borne coronavirus. That study was headlined, ‘Discovery of a rich gene pool of bat SARS-related coronaviruses provides new insights into the origin of SARS coronavirus.’  So what is really going on here?  The true behind-the-scenes story is coming to light:  Bill Gates Cast Doubt on Chloroquine And Said He Is Running A Study On It  Here is what Gates said regarding Chloroquine in a Reddit Ask Me Anything session:  “There are a lot of therapeutic drugs being examined. This is one of many but it is not proven. If it works we will need to make sure the finite supplies are held for the patients who need it most. We have a study going on to figure this out. We also have a screening effort to look at all the ideas for Therapeutics because the number being proposed is very large and only the most promising should be tried in patients. China was testing some things but now they have so few cases that that testing needs to move to other locations,” Gates said.  Gates Is Funding Coronavirus Vaccine Candidates That Would Compete With Chloroquine, And Dr. Fauci’s Agency Is Co-Partnering On The Project  The company Moderna is working on a Coronavirus vaccine, which they expect will go into clinical trials in April. Dr. Fauci has heaped praise on Moderna and said that a vaccine is the only way to definitively assure the end of the virus. Gates is working on multiple Coronavirus vaccine projects.  The New Eastern Outlook journal reported:  “Gates Foundation money is backing vaccine development on every front. Inovio Pharmaceuticals of Pennsylvania received $9 million from the Gates-backed CEPI, Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, to develop a vaccine, INO-4800, which is about to test on humans in April, a suspiciously rapid time frame. In addition Gates Foundation just gave the company an added $5 million to develop a proprietary smart device for intradermal delivery of the new vaccine.  In addition Gates Foundation monies via CEPI are financing development of a radical new vaccine method known as messengerRNA or mRNA.  They are co-funding the Cambridge, Massachusetts biotech company, Moderna Inc., to develop a vaccine against the Wuhan novel coronavirus, now called SARS-CoV-2. Moderna’s other partner is the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), a part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Head of NIAID is Dr Anthony Fauci, the person at the center of the Trump Administration virus emergency response. Notable about the Fauci-Gates Moderna coronavirus vaccine, mRNA-1273, is that it has been rolled out in a matter of weeks, not years, and on February 24 went directly to Fauci’s NIH for tests on human guinea pigs, not on mice as normal. Moderna’s chief medical adviser, Tal Zaks, argued, “I don’t think proving this in an animal model is on the critical path to getting this to a clinical trial…  Add to this the fact that the Gates Foundation and related entities such as CEPI constitute the largest funders of the public-private entity known as WHO, and that its current director, Tedros Adhanom, the first WHO director in history not a medical doctor, worked for years on HIV with the Gates Foundation when Tedros was a government minister in Ethiopia, and we see that there is practically no area of the current coronavirus pandemic where the footprints of the omnipresent Gates are not to be found. If that is to the good of mankind or grounds to be worried, time will tell.”  New Eastern Outlook journal passage ends  The Hill reported:  “Going into a Phase One trial within three months of getting the sequence is unquestionably the world indoor record. Nothing has ever gone that fast,” according to Fauci.  While it is uncertain that Moderna’s answer is the solution, Fauci notes that the only surefire way to stop an outbreak is to develop a vaccine. Moderna manufactures drugs around messenger RNA molecules that carry instructions to reprogram cells in the body to operate differently and beneficially. Currently, its genetic technology has not created a vaccine for humans.  The first study of the vaccine will take place at NIAID. If it is successful, a second trial would feature closer to hundreds of people. Pending the results of future studies and regulations, the vaccine may not be readily available until next year, Fauci said.  Hill passage ends  Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology News reported in 2016 on Gates’ relationship with Moderna:  “Moderna Therapeutics said today it received an initial $20 million grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to develop a new affordable combination of messenger RNA–based antibody therapeutics geared toward preventing HIV infection.  The grant is intended for use in the antibody combination’s preclinical study and a Phase I clinical trial. Gates Foundation’s $20 million funding could potentially grow into a total $100 million commitment—including the HIV antibody project—toward development of additional mRNA-based treatments for various infectious diseases, Moderna said.  “The foundation’s mission to help all people lead healthy and productive lives is well aligned with Moderna’s mission to deliver on the promise of transformative mRNA science to bring new medicines to patients,” Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel said in a statement.  Moderna said the development effort would be led by its infectious disease–focused venture company, Valera…”  Fauci Is Tight with Bill Gates  “He’s very good about not overpromising,” Gates said of Fauci in 2018 as Gates worked on a universal flu vaccine. NIAID Council minutes from 2019 show Fauci’s agency identifying a Gates Foundation workshop as being of interest. Gates met with Fauci in 2017 “to discuss research opportunities in global health.” In 2010, Fauci was named to the Leadership Council of the “Decade of Vaccines” Collaboration, which the World Health Organization, Fauci’s agency NIAID, UNICEF, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation convened.

The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (Gates Foundation) will also contribute $100 million to the goal of advancing these potential cures, with an aim toward providing affordable, globally available treatment that will be accessible to patients in low-resource settings.  According to the NIH, the collaboration between the organizations will focus on 2 key areas. First, it will identify potential candidate cures for preclinical and clinical evaluation, and second, it will define long-term opportunities to partner with organizations in Africa…  “This collaboration is an ambitious step forward, harnessing the most cutting-edge scientific tools and NIH’s sizable global HIV research infrastructure to one day deliver a cure and end the global HIV pandemic,” said NIAID director Anthony S. Fauci, MD, in a statement announcing the initiative. “We are taking into account those with the greatest need at the foundation of this effort, to ensure that, if realized, this exceptional public health achievement will be made accessible to all.”  Dr. Fauci Is Slated to Speak At The World Vaccine Congress in September 2020 Alongside A Coterie of Public Sector and Private Sector Folks From WHO, CDC, FDA, Merck, Pfizer, etc.  The event is in Washington, D.C.

Birx’s license to practice medicine in the state of Pennsylvania expired in 2014.  Deborah Birx Sits on the Board of The Global Fund, which is heavily funded by Bill Gates’ organizational network, as journalist Jordan Schactel discovered. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation gave the Global Fund a $750 million promissory note in 2012.  The Global Fund explains, “The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is a key partner of the Global Fund, providing cash contributions, actively participating on its board and committees, and supporting the Global Fund’s advocacy, communications and fundraising efforts. The Gates Foundation has contributed US$2.24 billion to the Global Fund to date, and pledged US$760 million for the Global Fund’s Sixth Replenishment, covering 2020-2022.”  Fauci Holds Numerous Patents That Present More Potential Conflicts of Interest For Him In The Medical Field, As Many of these Patents Directly Pertain To HIV Treatment  Here Is A List of Patents Held Or Pending Patent Applications Filed By Anthony S. Fauci  Fauci was previously accused of a conflict of interest regarding one of his patents in 1999.  FAUCI’S FRIEND PELOSI GALLIVANTED AROUND CHINATOWN DURING THE OUTBREAK  Democrat House Speaker Nancy Pelosi impeached President Donald Trump during the spread of the Coronavirus outbreak in the United States of America, while also encouraging people to socialize with her in the Chinatown district of San Francisco, where she visited a fortune cookie factory to portray her supposed opposition to bigotry and xenophobia.  The CDC confirmed the first U.S. case of the Chinese virus on January 21, in Seattle from a man who got back from Wuhan, China. Incidentally, the House impeachment managers kicked off opening arguments in the Trump “Ukraine”-focused impeachment trial two days later on January 23.  Pelosi told people to “Come join us!” during her Chinatown jaunt on February 24, which featured her aforementioned fortune cookie factory visit.  This was on February 24.

The message inside? “United We Stand.” pic.twitter.com/3piGq4yKXq — Nancy Pelosi (@SpeakerPelosi) February 25, 2020  During the most recent round of stimulus spending, Pelosi attempted to stall the Republican-backed plan in an effort to pass elements of the Green New Deal.  National File reported:  Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi’s 1,119 page coronavirus stimulus proposal includes a vast amount of hidden, nakedly partisan political provisions and regulations that are unrelated to family and small business relief. Several sharp-eyed social media users who had the fortitude to browse through the massive bill found bizarre provisions, including writer Rachel Bovard. “Pelosi’s #COVID19 bill is 1,119 pages and contains provisions for “conducting risk-limiting audits of results of elections” so yeah it’s really very focused on the crisis at hand,” Bovard said in a thread that compiled screenshots of various provisions in the bill. After proposing a bailout for the postal service, the Democratic bill includes sections about paid studies of “pay equity” between “racial and ethnic minorities” and their “white counterparts,” as well as a “comparison of pay between and women for similar roles and assignments.”  GATES IS EVERYWHERE  The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation recently provided massive amounts of funding to both the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) and Imperial College in London, which both produced wildly incorrect models for the Coronavirus outbreak that sparked worldwide panic and provided false justification for government leaders to shut down the American economy, creating mass unemployment. Bill Gates is a vaccine oligarch who recently laughed at America’s economic devastation, so committed he is to his vision of vaccinating the world’s population and keeping society locked down until that becomes possible. Gates, like his crony Dr. Anthony Fauci, has fought the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat the virus and has claimed that society will never fully return to normal until a vaccine is ready. (READ: The Dark Truth About Fauci, Birx, Bill Gates and the Globalist Elites).  White House Coronavirus task force member Dr. Deborah Birx touted the IHME’s “Chris Murray Model” in April. IHME is housed at the University of Washington and was reportedly founded by the Gates Foundation, according to a Fox 9 report. In 2017, the Gates Foundation provided a ten-year, $279 million grant to IHME. Birx, meanwhile, sits on the board of the Global Fund, which has received more than $2 billion from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The IHME model proved to be a total disaster. In Georgia, where Republican governor Brian Kemp led the charge for re-opening his state, the model previously predicted 1,783 new cases per day on June 12 and hundreds of new cases per day into August. That model, just revised, shows 367 new cases per day on June 12 and zero new cases per day by August.  Deborah Birx, whose PA medical license is expired, used a bogus Gates-funded model to shut down the country, defended counting non-definitive cases as Coronavirus, sits on board of Global Fund which has taken more than $2 BILLION from Gates Foundation…https://t.co/DhgcEibTdD — Patrick Howley (@HowleyReporter) April 21, 2020  In March 2020, during the Coronavirus outbreak, the Gates Foundation awarded a more than $79 million grant to Imperial College London. The Imperial College London model, spearheaded by team leader Neil Ferguson, projected 2.2 million American casualties. The disastrous model led to Elon Musk lambasting Ferguson, who resigned as an adviser to the British government when he was caught flaunting the very lockdown that his numbers inspired. Imperial College London admits on its website that its research on arboviruses, which includes work on vaccine projections undertaken by Neil Ferguson himself is Gates-funded, stating, “Our research is funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the US National Institutes of Health and the MRC.” Business Insider reports that Neil Ferguson’s MRC Center for Global Infectious Disease at Imperial College “gets tens of millions of dollars in annual funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and works with the UK National Health Service, the US Centres for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC), and is tasked with supplying the World Health Organization with “rapid analysis of urgent infectious disease problems.” A job posting that opened in December 2019 and closed in January 2020 stated (emphasis added): “We are seeking an outstanding Research Lead for the Vaccine Impact Modelling Consortium (https://www.vaccineimpact.org/). This major collaborative initiative directed by Professor Neil Ferguson, is based within the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London and funded jointly by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance ($11 million over 2016-22).”  A Chinese government entity that has partnered with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation led a delegation of public health experts to the Wuhan Institute of Virology in December 2018, after the lab had already begun its bat coronavirus research funded by Dr. Anthony Fauci’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). This discovery was made by citizen journalist Amazing Polly (@99freemind). President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have emboldened the narrative that Coronavirus originated at the Wuhan lab.  The Chinese government’s Center for Global Public Health (CGPH) guided ten experts from Africa to the Wuhan lab and other Chinese institutions and reached a consensus on “training of biosafety personnel.” The information on the trip from Wuhan Institute of Virology’s website can be READ HERE. According to the website, “CGPH has managed and implemented foreign aid mission assigned by the National Health and Family Planning Commission and the Ministry of Commerce, as well as international cooperation projects funded by the United Kingdom Department for International Development and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.”","BUSTED: CDC Inflated COVID Numbers, Accused of Violating Federal Law",false
427,289535439558375674628494010753556240986,"By Cassandra Fairbanks and Jim Hoft  On Tuesday, November 3rd President Trump was ahead of Joe Biden in the swing state of Michigan by over 100,000 votes. This appeared to be another solid win for President Trump in Michigan with a greater margin than his 2016 victory. The ballot counting in Detroit, Michigan on election night took place at the TCF Center, formerly known as Cobo Hall.  This is the site where Detroit City Officials put cardboard over the windows to prevent the GOP observers from seeing in, where poll workers were militantly hostile to the GOP observers, and where hundreds of affidavits by election observers claim they witnessed voter fraud.  At least three election observers testified in sworn affidavits that they witnessed vehicles delivering fraudulent ballots to the TCF Center early in the morning on November 4th.  TRENDING: Schumer, McConnell Reach Agreement on Trump Impeachment Trial - Here Are the Details  Michigander Shane Trejo witnessed the 3:30 am Biden Ballot Drop that gave Joe Biden an outstanding lift. “There were thousands of ballots in each box,” Trejo says. “There were at least 50 boxes that I saw unloaded at 3:30 am, well after the 8:00 pm deadline for ballots to show up.”  The 3:30 am was the first ballot delivery since 10:30 pm when 138,000 ballots showed up suddenly. Shane later testified that he noticed that the city of Detroit Clerk’s Office and its emblem were written on the white van that showed up with the ballots. City Clerk Janice Winfrey‘s name was on the van and a number presumably for Janet Winfrey’s office. Trejo says the ballots could not be processed when they arrived, so by the time they were counted, a new shift of poll workers had come in for the day.  After these ballot drops Joe Biden took the lead in Michigan.  Shane Trejo explained how the timing was important. The Biden Ballot Drop took place at the end of one shift. The ballots were left uncounted. So when the new shift came to count ballots they didn’t know where the ballots had come from.  Trejo repeatedly asked about this truck to site supervisors and was STONEWALLED.  Former Michigan State Senator Pat Colbeck was also present at the TCF Center on the morning of November 4th. Senator Colbeck also witnessed the 3:30 am Biden Ballot Drop. Colbeck spoke with The Gateway Pundit back in November, “I went back there and I witnessed a mini-panel truck if you will with a Detroit Election Bureau regalia all over the side and a vehicle ID number on it… And inside of it, and this gets into some chain of custody discussions, there was no indication that there was a Republican and a Democrat (present) during transfer. We don’t know if they stopped by a sidestreet in Coney Island and picked up a few more ballots during transfer. We have no way of verifying any of that information.”  The authorities and media in Michigan were completely uninterested in following up on this shocking story.  Until today, no one has bothered to review the video footage from the TCF Center on election night.  The Gateway Pundit requested the TCF video back in December!  The TCF Center tried to quote us over $22,000 for one day’s worth of video.  We requested two hours of video.  Last Friday we were sent the requested video.  Since last week we have been combing through the hundreds of hours of security camera footage from the TCF Center on the morning of November 4th.  And what we found is a political bombshell.  ** At 3:23 AM The Gateway Pundit has exclusive video of a white van registered to the city of Detroit entering the gate into the TCF Center.  ** At 3:25 AM we discovered video from a second camera showing three individuals unloading over 50 boxes of ballots in a hallway inside the TCF Building and just outside the counting room.  ** The ballots were then wheeled away on carts into the ballot counting room.  ** The van is then seen on video leaving the center about 25 minutes later.  ** Then we saw the van returning an hour later, entering the TCF Center again and unloading more boxes of ballots.  ** The white van was escorted by a black sports car for both ballot deliveries.  ** The white van was allowed through an electronic gate to enter the TCF complex.  This is video proof of the fraud in Detroit, Michigan. It is exactly as the GOP observers described it to us back in November!  We have more damning video from the TCF Center to release in the coming days.  Here is our video on the election fraud in the Detroit TCF Center on election night:  Special thanks to Cassandra Fairbanks who did an outstanding job on this project.  ** PLEASE SUPPORT THE GATEWAY PUNDIT’S DOCUMENTATION OF MICHIGAN VOTER FRAUD.

428,145415616364633085361608761283539967664,"US Under Military Law, Congress Arrested, War With CCP Won and No One Knows It      Joe Biden was sworn in as president of a bankrupt and defunct US Inc. Corporation. Just prior to his pre-recorded-in-Hollywood-by-Castle Rock Entertainment Inauguration, Washington DC, Capitol Hill and the White House were secured within miles of barbed wire fences and 60,000 National Guard troops.  Now over a week later, over 30,000 troops and the barbed wire fencing remained. Why?  An answer came early Mon. morning 25 Jan. when from 3am to 6am arrests of 80 to 140 Congress people appeared to be underway at Capitol Hill – after which Congress seemed to have disappeared. Why? https://www.bitchute.com/video/oYzu0wcwa3GE/ House cancels business during first full Biden week – Washington Times US Military at the White House Arresting Congress | Politics | Before It’s News  In reality an Interim Military US Government had taken over Washington DC and was running our country. The two US governments: (1) a legitimate Interim Military US Government empowered by the Constitution and the Department of Defense under Military Code 11.3, and (2) an illegal, fraudulent foreign paid-for, foreign controlled (on the foreign ground of the District of Columbia) Biden Administration.  The US Military appeared to be in charge of Biden and making him sign blank Executive Orders on a stage set of the Oval Office. The White House was said to be empty. Why? https://www.rumormillnews.com/cgi-bin/forum.cgi?read=164754  The whole operation began way last Jan. 2020 during a government shutdown. President Trump was said to have reorganized several agencies including the US Treasury, IRS and Federal Reserve. Now the US Military had control of all assets including taxpayer dollars at the new US Treasury near Reno. Why?  The Military had been tasked with conducting a return to a gold/asset-backed dollar and to insure that the US Republic was restored to original laws of the Constitution as written prior to 1871. http://www.rumormillnews.com/cgi-bin/forum.cgi?read=115613  This was all made possible after a Sat. 9 Jan 2021 raid by US Military Special Op Teams on CIA Headquarters in Langley Virginia. The raid produced firm evidence that the CIA, Democrats and other traitors had conspired with foreign entities led by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), to interfere in the 2020 Election.  Earlier that Saturday morning 9 Jan. there had been two attempts on Trump and his wife Melania’s lives (there were said to have been twelve plus such attempts since he gained office).  Trump had had enough. He immediately instigated the Insurrection Act (put into law by George Bush Jr. after 9/11), and then turned his authority over to the US Military.  With the nation now under Martial Law, Trump would remain as US President until all those who committed treason were arrested, including those who certified the illegal 2020 Election.  Some in the Pentagon had been preparing for this for over twenty years. US Attorney General for Utah John Huber and his 740 investigators had been very busy since 2016. The US government was corrupt throughout including Congress and the three letter agencies. There were a lot of traitors whose cases had already been processed through State Grand Juries. There was an estimated 80 to 140 Congress people thought named in over 223,000 sealed indictments filed in federal courts since Trump took office.  Of those, 85% to 95% indicted were Democrats, intermixed with a few Rino Republicans. The majority of charges were said to be pedophilia, child exploitation, misappropriation of US Taxpayer funds and conspiring with foreign powers to influence the 2020 Presidential Election – an act of Treason. Some serious charges couldn’t be brought because Obama pardoned so many in his last days in office.  By Jan. 2 2020 Military Tribunals were said to have already began at GITMO for high profile elites such as the Clintons, Obamas and Bushes. Charges against them were believed to include Capital High Treason, Election Fraud, Child Sex Trafficking, Money Laundering, Misappropriation of US Taxpayer Funds, plus Uranium One, 9/11 and Benghazi crimes.  Deep State Special prosecutor Robert Mueller was believed to have been charged for his involvement in the 9/11 cover-up (he was appointed FBI Director 7 days before 9/11 and oversaw 9/11 so-called “investigations”), plus he conducted an ongoing fake Russian witch-hunt against Trump. https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/168059921/  It was no wonder the Democrats wanted to impeach Trump, again. On Thurs. 28 Jan. certain traitors in both the House and Senate did in fact recognize Trump as the acting US President when they voted, again, to try to impeach him. Under rules of the Constitution you could not impeach a US President if he didn’t presently hold the office.  Donald Trump wasn’t worried about being impeached from the presidency of the bankrupt and defunct US Corporation. He had other plans. On 11 Jan. 2021 Donald Trump was inaugurated as head of the Patriot or Constitutional Party, which made him a candidate for US President, again.  The US Military was about to restore the US Republic to laws underlying the original Constitution as written prior to 1871. That election was planned to be held on 4 March 2021 through use of a transparent, secure and instantaneous Quantum Voting Computer where citizens could vote using their own computers, or phones.  For many years the Chinese Communist Party (not the Chinese government, which was working to become a democracy) had been involved in a takeover of America. That war culminated when just prior to the 2020 US Presidential Election, the CCP bought Dominion Voting machines that through use of an Italian satellite loaned with money at the Vatican, threw what was believed to be millions of Trump votes to Biden. And, the CIA raid proved it all.  The war between the CCP and the US actually ended on Thurs. 28 Jan. Former Navy Intelligence officer Simeon Parkes reported a showdown in the South China Sea. The CCP had been trying to take over Taiwan. Taiwan was where gold was stored that would back countries including the US, for a Global Currency Reset. Parks said that there were air battles between America and Taiwan fighter jets against CCP jets and “the CCP lost big time.”  The New World Order fans had lost their war. A banker source out of Zurich said they had promised to settle everything by Fri. 29 Jan. https://www.simonparkes.org/blog  Rinus Verhagen reported that “the CCP has abandoned their Big Restart Operation and the liberal elite-scheduled reboot of Globalism has failed. Operation COVID-19, expressed in the book “Great Restoration” by Klaus Schwab, President of the Davos Global Economic Forum, has also failed. The CCP would not impose a Global Order. Their power, like any commercial empire, was limited to an economic expansion.” http://www.takecare4.eu/panic-in-dc/ Take care 4 –  Please Support beforeitsnews, By Trying Some Of Our Health Products, By Following This Link To Our Health Supplement Store!

In a post on social media dumpster fire Parler, Lindell produced a new spin on the real reason behind the Capitol attack.  “The rioters were hypnotized by antifa temptresses who hid psychoactive drugs in their vaginas,” said Lindell. “If you look at the video, many of the rioters had crazed looks in their eyes.”  Several Trump supporters are still clinging to the ridiculous fantasy that antifa was behind the attack, not Trump supporters.  Lindell is a notorious conspiracy theorist who seems to leave a trail of wreckage in his wake. Last week, a Newsmax reporter walked off the set after Lindell started ranting about fixed voting machines.  “On Tuesday, (Bob) Sellers tried to get a steaming Lindell back on cue: ‘We wanted to talk to you about canceling culture, if you will. We don’t want to re-litigate the allegations that you’re making, Mike.’ But Lindell wouldn’t stop talking about fraud,” said The Washington Post. “The Newsmax anchor finally asked his producers to end the segment. ‘Can we get out of here, please?’ he asked. Then the anchor simply got up and walked off the set.”  However, Lindell’s profligate lying may have finally caught up with him. He’s been banned from Twitter and his products are being kicked out of stores. Now, he’s being sued by Dominion Voting Systems.  “Despite your repeated promises—not to mention your considerable and costly efforts to bankroll a so-called investigation into Dominion—you have failed to identify a scintilla of credible evidence that even suggests that Dominion is somehow involved in a global conspiracy to harvest millions of votes in favor of President-elect Biden,” said a letter from Dominion’s attorneys. “Of course, this is because no such evidence exists. But that is of no consequence to you because you are resolutely uninterested in acknowledging the truth about these issues.”  Smartmatic, another company that makes voting software, has sued FOX News for $2.7 billion for spreading false stories about its role in election fraud.",Lindell: Capitol Rioters Were Drugged By Antifa Sluts,false

The 2nd Nuremberg Tribunal is a fact. Its act has been in preparation for months now.  This is under the leadership of German lawyer Dr. Reiner Fuellmich, who is currently filing a class action. What is a class action? A class action, also called a representative action or group claim, is a form of jurisprudence in which a large group of people collectively bring a claim before the court or in which a certain class of defendants is prosecuted.  And now good news from Norway:  A group of researchers from Norway have filed a lawsuit against the corona policy.  The Norwegian government is being sued for crimes against humanity.

A new pre-printed (non-peer-reviewed) study on vaccine efficacy suggests that vaccinations are effective against SARS-CoV-2 variants… until they aren’t. The study, published in Yale-owned medical journal medRxiv, was conducted by the following scientists:  Christian Holm Hansen, Astrid Blicher Schelde, Ida Rask Moustsen-Helms, Hanne-Dorthe Emborg, Tyra Grove Krause, Kaare Moelbak, Palle Valentiner-Branth, The Infectious Disease Preparedness Group at Statens Serum Institute  The abstract of the study, below, says that vaccines are effective at protecting against the Omicron variant, but in the Delta variant, protection wanes “rapidly.” In just a matter of months, the jab is not effective at all, the studies find. Contrast that degree of defense against natural immunity, which can protect individuals from SARS-CoV-2 for years according to the latest information:  In this brief communication we are showing original research results with early estimates from Danish nationwide databases of vaccine effectiveness (VE) against the novel SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) up to five months after a primary vaccination series with the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccines. Our study provides evidence of protection against infection with the Omicron variant after completion of a primary vaccination series with the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccines; in particular, we found a VE against the Omicron variant of 55.2% (95% confidence interval (CI): 23.5 to 73.7%) and 36.7% (95% CI: -69.9 to 76.4%) for the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines, respectively, in the first month after primary vaccination. However, the VE is significantly lower than that against Delta infection and declines rapidly over just a few months. The VE is re-established upon revaccination with the BNT162b2 vaccine (54.6%, 95% CI: 30.4 to 70.4%).  The abstract does not do a great job of explaining the most newsworthy findings, however. Deeper into the study, you can see that the scientists found that unvaccinated folks are actually 76.5% LESS likely to contract SARS-CoV-2 than those with a jab from the company.  Moderna vaccine effectiveness also provides relatively shoddy defense from the virus and its strains. Moderna customers are 39.3% more likely to contract the virus than unvaccinated people.  Rebel News chief Ezra Levant shared the study to Twitter with findings accompanying a screenshot, attached below:  “This study shows that after three months the vaccine effectiveness of Pfizer & Moderna against Omicron is actually negative. Pfizer customers are 76.5% more likely and Moderna customers are 39.3% more likely to be infected than unvaxxed people,” writes Levant:  Holy moly.

434,123434929823647002242066500330518325311,"The scientific community speaks out against the health policy of the authorities: the declaration of Great Barrington (USA) against massive injections of mRNA has collected 870.000 signatures.  While the President of the French Republic meets this Monday, December 6, a new Council of Defense to fight against the spread of the epidemic of Covid-19, more and more voices are raised against the health policy completely crazy of the authorities which aims to vaccinate more and more the population. After the third dose of vaccine imposed, under penalty of deactivation of the health pass! There is now the question of vaccinating children from 5 to 11 years old. A decision that would be very serious according to many doctors and researchers that we have reported here.  Serious side effects  Mass vaccination with a still experimental messenger RNA vaccine has long worried the scientific community. As of October 4, 2020, three high-level scientists, Prof. Martin Kulldorff, professor of medicine at Harvard University, biostatistician and epidemiologist, specializing in the detection and monitoring of infectious disease outbreaks and in the evaluation of vaccine safety. Dr. Sunetra Gupta, professor at Oxford University, an epidemiologist specializing in immunology, vaccine development and mathematical modeling of infectious diseases. And Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, a professor at Stanford University School of Medicine, a physician, epidemiologist, health economist, and public health policy expert specializing in infectious diseases and vulnerable populations, recommended an alternative approach to Covid-19 in what was called the Great Barrington Declaration. Because they are very concerned about the side effects of mass vaccination on populations.  What do they advocate? A “focused” protection. That is to say, to protect as much as possible the elderly, the infirm, the frail and to leave the others to live normally until the society reaches the collective immunity. However, mass vaccination by mRNA makes this collective immunity impossible.  One of the original co-signatories was Dr. Simon Thornley, an epidemiologist and biostatistician at the University of Auckland. The Great Barrington Declaration has since been signed by 60,000 physicians and scientists and is becoming increasingly well known around the world. A petition has so far gathered 870,000 signatures of support.  The Great Barrington Declaration  “The Great Barrington Declaration – As infectious disease epidemiologists and public health scientists we have grave concerns about the damaging physical and mental health impacts of the prevailing COVID-19 policies, and recommend an approach we call Focused Protection.  Coming from both the left and right, and around the world, we have devoted our careers to protecting people. Current lockdown policies are producing devastating effects on short and long-term public health. The results (to name a few) include lower childhood vaccination rates, worsening cardiovascular disease outcomes, fewer cancer screenings and deteriorating mental health – leading to greater excess mortality in years to come, with the working class and younger members of society carrying the heaviest burden. Keeping students out of school is a grave injustice.  Keeping these measures in place until a vaccine is available will cause irreparable damage, with the underprivileged disproportionately harmed.  Fortunately, our understanding of the virus is growing. We know that vulnerability to death from COVID-19 is more than a thousand-fold higher in the old and infirm than the young. Indeed, for children, COVID-19 is less dangerous than many other harms, including influenza.  As immunity builds in the population, the risk of infection to all – including the vulnerable – falls. We know that all populations will eventually reach herd immunity – i.e. the point at which the rate of new infections is stable – and that this can be assisted by (but is not dependent upon) a vaccine. Our goal should therefore be to minimize mortality and social harm until we reach herd immunity.  The most compassionate approach that balances the risks and benefits of reaching herd immunity, is to allow those who are at minimal risk of death to live their lives normally to build up immunity to the virus through natural infection, while better protecting those who are at highest risk. We call this Focused Protection.  Adopting measures to protect the vulnerable should be the central aim of public health responses to COVID-19. By way of example, nursing homes should use staff with acquired immunity and perform frequent testing of other staff and all visitors. Staff rotation should be minimized. Retired people living at home should have groceries and other essentials delivered to their home. When possible, they should meet family members outside rather than inside. A comprehensive and detailed list of measures, including approaches to multi-generational households, can be implemented, and is well within the scope and capability of public health professionals.  Those who are not vulnerable should immediately be allowed to resume life as normal. Simple hygiene measures, such as hand washing and staying home when sick should be practiced by everyone to reduce the herd immunity threshold. Schools and universities should be open for in-person teaching. Extracurricular activities, such as sports, should be resumed. Young low-risk adults should work normally, rather than from home. Restaurants and other businesses should open. Arts, music, sport and other cultural activities should resume. People who are more at risk may participate if they wish, while society as a whole enjoys the protection conferred upon the vulnerable by those who have built up herd immunity.”","60,000 scientists call for an end to mass vaccination",false
435,82371791301993633359657902051467520334,"Early on in the pandemic, before the vaccines were available, the Southern Brazilian city of Itajai offered Ivermectin as a prophylaxis against the disease.  Between July and December of 2020, roughly 220,000 people were offered a dose of 0.2mg/kg/day (roughly 18mg for a 200lb person) as an optional treatment for 2 days, once every two weeks.  133,051 people took them up on it, while 87,466 did not.  After analyzing the data, a team of researchers spanning several Brazilian institutes, the University of Toronto, and Columbia's EAFIT concluded in a December pre-print study that hospitalization and mortality rates were cut in half over the seven month period among the Ivermectin group.  This is even more impressive when you learn the IVM users were older on average, with 30% >50 yo versus 20% for non-IVM users. The mortality reduction is even higher looking at different age groups. 85% for 31-49 yo and 59% for >50 yo. pic.twitter.com/K6D5naybCS — Simon Vallée (@sival84) December 11, 2021  The authors adjusted for relevant confounding variables, including age, sex, medical history, previous diseases, and other conditions.  The analysis contradicts an October report by Business Insider which claims, based on a Brazilian ICU doctor's anecdotal evidence, that the experiment was a failure.  Study limitations:  The authors note, ""Being a retrospective observational analysis, it is uncertain whether results would be reproducible in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial, but likely, since groups of ivermectin users and non-users had similar demographic characteristics, and rates were adjusted for the relevant confounding variables.""  We're sure the 'fact checkers' are already hard at work trying to debunk the pre-print, however they may also want to take a look at ivmmeta.com - a real-time meta analysis of 70 studies which found that Ivermectin works as a prophylaxis 83% of the time. In peer-reviewed studies, it was found effective 70% of the time as an early treatment, and just 39% of the time as a late treatment.  As we noted during the whole 'horse paste' controversy:  Ivermectin  This widely prescribed anti-parasitic which is also used in horses has shown meaningful efficacy worldwide in the treatment of mild and moderate cases of Covid-19, plus as a prophylactic. India's Uttar Pradesh province, with a population of over 200 million, says that widespread early use of Ivermectin 'helped keep positivity [and] deaths low.'  (source, May 12th)  Separately, there have been several studies funded by the Indian government, primarily conducted through their largest govt. public medical university (AIIMS).  Role of ivermectin in the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers in India: A matched case-control study (source) Conclusion: Two-dose ivermectin prophylaxis at a dose of 300 μg/kg with a gap of 72 hours was associated with a 73% reduction of SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers for the following month .  Ivermectin as a potential treatment for mild to moderate COVID-19 – A double blind randomized placebo-controlled trial (source) Conclusion: There was no difference in the primary outcome i.e. negative RT-PCR status on day 6 of admission with the use of ivermectin. However, a significantly higher proportion of patients were discharged alive from the hospital when they received ivermectin .  Clinical Research Report Ivermectin in combination with doxycycline for treating COVID-19 symptoms: a randomized trial (source, double-blind randomized, peer-reviewed) Discussion: In the present study, patients with mild or moderate COVID-19 infection treated with ivermectin in combination with doxycycline generally recovered 2 days earlier than those treated with placebo . The proportion of patients responding within 7 days of treatment was significantly higher in the treatment group than in the placebo group. The proportions of patients who remained symptomatic after 12 days of illness and who experienced disease progression were significantly lower in the treatment group than in the placebo group. Here are more human studies from other countries on the 'horse dewormer': Peru: Sharp Reductions in COVID-19 Case Fatalities and Excess Deaths in Peru in Close Time Conjunction, State-By-State, with Ivermectin Treatments (source, peer-reviewed, University of Toronto, Universidad EAFIT) For the 24 states with early IVM treatment (and Lima), excess deaths dropped 59% (25%) at +30 days and 75% (25%) at +45 days after day of peak deaths . Case fatalities likewise dropped sharply in all states but Lima Spain:  The effect of early treatment with ivermectin on viral load, symptoms and humoral response in patients with non-severe COVID-19: A pilot, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial (source, University of Barcelona, peer-reviewed) Findings: Patients in the ivermectin group recovered earlier from hyposmia/anosmia (76 vs 158 patient-days; p < 0.001) .  Bengladesh: A Comparative Study on Ivermectin-Doxycycline and Hydroxychloroquine- Azithromycin Therapy on COVID-19 Patients (source - peer reviewed, though not govt funded) Conclusion: According to our study, the Ivermectin-Doxycycline combination therapy has better symptomatic relief, shortened recovery duration, fewer adverse effects, and superior patient compliance compared to the Hydroxychloroquine- Azithromycin combination. Based on this study's outcomes, the Ivermectin-Doxycycline combination is a superior choice for treating patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 disease . A five-day course of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19 may reduce the duration of illness (source, peer-reviewed double blind randomized, though small sample size) Discussion: A 5-day course of ivermectin resulted in an earlier clearance of the virus compared to placebo (p = 0.005), thus indicating that early intervention with this agent may limit viral replication within the host. In the 5-day ivermectin group, there was a significant drop in CRP and LDH by day 7, which are indicators of disease severity.  Why does Ivermectin, a 'horse dewormer' work? For starters, it's a protease inhibitor. Interestingly, Pfizer's 2x/day Covid-19 prophylactic they're trialing right now is also a protease inhibitor.  Perhaps the most damning evidence in favor of Ivermectin is the medical establishment's position that it's essentially snake oil, despite the fact that it's had a glowing safety profile for decades, until now.","Hospitalizations, Mortality Cut In Half After Brazilian City Offered Ivermectin To Everyone Pre-Vaccine",false
436,88992595120006181808580301868625504013,"(Natural News) This finding can only be described as a true “horror” in its implications. Stunning new research published in Viruses, part of the SARS-CoV-2 Host Cell Interactions edition of MDPI (Open Access Journals) reveals that vaccine spike proteins enter cell nuclei and wreak havoc on cells’ DNA repair mechanism, suppressing DNA repair by as much as 90%.  The research paper is entitled, “SARS–CoV–2 Spike Impairs DNA Damage Repair and Inhibits V(D)J Recombination In Vitro” and is authored by Hui Jiang and Ya-Fang Mei, at the Department of Molecular Biosciences, The Wenner–Gren Institute, Stockholm University, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden, and the Department of Clinical Microbiology, Virology, Umeå University, SE-90185 Umeå, Sweden, respectively.  We have saved a copy of the research paper in a PDF document on NN servers at this URL:  https://www.naturalnews.com/files/viruses-13-02056-v2.pdf  In the conclusion of the paper, authors write, “We found that the spike protein markedly inhibited both BRCA1 and 53BP1 foci formation (Figure 3D–G). Together, these data show that the SARS–CoV–2 full–length spike protein inhibits DNA damage repair by hindering DNA repair protein recruitment.”  The DNA repair mechanism, known as NHEJ (Non-Homologous End Joining) is a kind of intracellular “emergency response” system that repairs double-stranded DNA breaks. Without the NHEJ mechanism, all advanced multi-cellular life would cease to exist. No human being, animal or plant can survive with the integrity of its genetic code being protected and constantly repaired through multiple mechanisms.  DNA damage can be caused by exposure to radiation, chemicals found in foods and personal care products, or even exposure to mammography equipment. Excessive sunlight exposure can also cause DNA breaks, and minor DNA mutations occur spontaneously in all living organisms. Airline pilots, for example, are routinely exposed to ionizing radiation due to flying at altitude.  In a normal, healthy person, the NHEJ mechanism repairs the DNA and prevents a pathogenic mutation from occurring. But in the presence of the vaccine spike protein, NHEJ effectiveness is suppressed by as much as 90%, meaning it is unable to do its job due to the suppressed ability to recruit proteins for repair.  As a result, the following “errors” are introduced into chromosomes inside the nuclei of human cells, all due to the presence of the spike protein from mRNA vaccines:  Mutations or “errors” in the genetic sequence.  DELETIONS of entire segments of genetic code.  INSERTIONS of incorrect segments.  Mixing and matching / permutations of genetic code.  These errors, when expressed through cell division and replication, result in:  An explosion of cancer and cancer tumors throughout the body  Loss of production of immune system B and T cells (i.e. induced immunodeficiency)  Autoimmune disorders  Accelerated aging and reduced telomere length  Loss of functioning of complex organ systems such as circulatory, neurological, endocrine, muskuloskeletal, etc.  Cellular damage resembling radiation poisoning as cells destroy themselves from within  Many of these effects are, of course, fatal. Others will burden vaccine victims with horrendous debilitating injuries and organ malfunctions that will require a lifetime of medical intervention.  Spike protein goes into the nucleus of the cell  From the paper linked above:  Mechanistically, we found that the spike protein localizes in the nucleus and inhibits DNA damage repair by impeding key DNA repair protein BRCA1 and 53BP1 recruitment to the damage site.  This means that the spike protein, which is generated in cell ribosomes after the cells have been hijacked by mRNA vaccines, doesn’t always leave the cell and enter the bloodstream as we are told by mRNA vaccine proponents. In some cases, the spike protein enters the cell nucleus. There, it interferes with the DNA repair mechanism as described throughout this article.  “Surprisingly, we found the abundance of the spike protein in the nucleus (Figure 1A),” concluded study authors.  This means, without question, mRNA vaccines result in chromosomal alterations in the body’s cells. It is confirmation that such vaccines are, indeed, wreaking havoc with genetic integrity and are exhibiting side effects that have not been anticipated or described by mRNA vaccine proponents.  Dr. Thomas Levy writes about the toxicity of the spike protein on Orthomolecular.org:  Concern has been raised regarding the dissemination of the spike protein throughout the body after vaccination. Rather than staying localized at the injection site in order to provoke the immune response and nothing more, spike protein presence has been detected throughout the body of some vaccinated individuals. Furthermore, it appears that some of the circulating spike proteins simply bind the ACE2 receptors without entering the cell, inducing an autoimmune response to the entire cell-spike protein entity. Depending on the cell type that binds the spike protein, any of a number of autoimmune medical conditions can result.  More alarmingly, Dr. Levy explains that current evidence shows the spike protein continues to produced in the body, following the initial mRNA injection. He explains:  While the underlying pathology remains to be completely defined, one explanation for the problems with thrombotic tendencies and other symptomatology seen with chronic COVID and post-vaccination patients relates directly to the persistent presence of the spike protein part of the coronavirus. Some reports assert that the spike protein can continue to be produced after the initial binding to the ACE2 receptors and entry into some of the cells that it initially targets. The clinical pictures of chronic COVID and post-vaccine toxicity appear very similar, and both are likely due to this continued presence, and body-wide dissemination, of the spike protein (Mendelson et al., 2020; Aucott and Rebman, 2021; Levy, 2021; Raveendran, 2021).  Full-length spike protein resulted in the greatest suppression of NHEJ DNA repair mechanism  See the figures below. SARS-CoV-2 viral fragments are named “Nsp1, Nsp5” and so on. The full-length spike is called “Spike” and the nucleocapsid — another structural part of the whole spike protein pathogen — is identified separately.  From the study:  Overexpression of Nsp1, Nsp5, Nsp13, Nsp14, and spike proteins diminished the efficiencies of both HR and NHEJ repair (Figure 1B–E and Figure S2A,B).  Figures C and E show the suppression of NHEJ repair by these various portions of viral fragments. (See the blue vertical graph lines representing activity / efficiency levels of the DNA repair mechanism).  What these data show is that the greatest suppression of NHEJ activity is measured when the full spike protein is present. From the study:  Together, these data show that the SARS–CoV–2 full–length spike protein inhibits DNA damage repair by hindering DNA repair protein recruitment.  This is the spike protein that’s generated by the body’s own cells after being injected with an mRNA vaccine:  In figure 2, below, we see that the suppression of NHEJ activity exhibits a dose-dependent response to the presence of spike protein (figures 2B and 2C). This indicates that the more spike proteins are present, the greater the suppression of DNA repair:  The bottom right figure, 2G, shows how the presence of the spike protein inhibits DNA repair following various insults to the DNA, such as radiation, chemical exposure or oxidation. Importantly, as the study authors explain:  Following different DNA damage treatments, such as ?–irradiation, doxorubicin treatment, and H2O2 treatment, there is less repair in the presence of the spike protein (Figure 2F,G). Together, these data demonstrate that the spike protein directly affects DNA repair in the nucleus.  5G exposure, chemtrail exposure, food chemical exposure, mammography and even sunlight exposure will wreak havoc in those who have taken mRNA vaccines  The horrifying upshot of this finding is that people who have taken mRNA vaccines will experience suppressed DNA repair, escalating exposures that were once thought to be minor issues to significant threats to their health.  In other words, people exposed to 5G radiation, mammography exams, plasticizer chemicals in food products, and carcinogens in personal care products (laundry detergents, perfumes, shampoos, skin lotions, etc.) will be unable to repair the DNA damage caused by those exposures. Following relatively small exposures, they will begin to mutate and develop cancers throughout their bodies.  Don’t forget that 5G exposure results in peroxynitrite production in the blood, an extremely dangerous free radical that causes DNA damage in brain cells and tissue cells across the body.  This could even be described as a kind of binary weapon system where mRNA vaccines weaken DNA repair, and 5G exposure (or chemical exposure in the food supply) provides the weapon that breaks DNA strands and leads to the body being unable to maintain genetic integrity during cell replication. This doesn’t take long to be expressed in horrific physical ways, such as the attempted growing of internal organ tissues on the surface of the skin or face, which is why I have titled today’s Situation Update podcast, “Monsters, Zombies and Mutants.”  The presence of the spike protein interferes with normal immune function and leads to immunodeficiency (an AIDS-like condition)  This research also finds that spike proteins from mRNA vaccines can lead to immunodeficiency conditions, similar to AIDS. This is consistent with what we have previously reported about immune function dropping roughly 5% per week in those who have taken covid vaccines. From the study:  …[L]oss of function of key DNA repair proteins such as ATM, DNA–PKcs, 53BP1, et al., leads to defects in the NHEJ repair which inhibit the production of functional B and T cells, leading to immunodeficiency.  Immune function is also critically affected by the presence of the spike protein, potentially leading to cancerous mutations throughout the body’s cells. As the study explains:  DNA damage repair, especially NHEJ repair, is essential for V(D)J recombination, which lies at the core of B and T cell immunity.  As Science Direct also explains:  Maintaining genomic integrity is imperative for the survival of an organism. Among different DNA damages, double-strand breaks (DSBs) are considered as most deleterious since they can lead to cell death if left unrepaired or chromosomal rearrangements when mis-repaired, leading to cancer.  Further, mutations in NHEJ genes including Ku70 and Ku80 have been associated with shortened life spans in mice [54]. In addition, defects in DNA-PKcs (DNA-dependent protein kinase) resulted in impaired telomere maintenance and shortened life span in mice [55]. Taken together, these lines of evidence suggest that NHEJ plays an important role in preventing age-related increase in genomic instability and functional decline.  In effect, this means the spike protein’s suppression of the NHEJ DNA repair mechanism also leads to reduced lifespan and accelerated aging.  By some estimates, 50% of the people injected with mRNA vaccines will be dead within five years. Now we have a deeper understanding of the mechanisms by which those vaccine-induced fatalities may occur.  Hear the verbal explanation of all this in today’s Situation Update podcast:  Brighteon.com/cb351cd3-6c94-4f2b-a05d-bbda757d4472  We will cover more about this in tomorrow’s podcast as well.

Dr. Fauci was commenting on a recent study that showed that the Covid vaccines may actually make a recipient more likely to be reinfected than someone with natural immunity from a prior infection.  “This would not be the first time, if it happened, that a vaccine that looked good in initial safety actually made people worse,” Fauci said. “There was the history of the Respiratory Syncitial Virus vaccine in children, which paradoxically made the children worse.”  Pause and read that again. Now consider all of the announcements made by “public health experts” that promised the “vaccines” were “100% safe and effective,” even for children who are at nearly zero risk.

He went on to state another example that he was directly involved with where a treatment made individuals worse.  “One of the HIV vaccines that we tested several years ago actually made individuals more likely to get infected,” Fauci added.  The RSV vaccine’s failure was exposed in 2008 by researchers who finally untangled the decades-old mystery.  “In the late 1960s, children in Washington, DC received an RSV vaccine in which the virus was inactivated with formalin,” Reuters reported. “Eighty percent of the children given the shot were hospitalized with severe respiratory disease, and two died. Many scientists had thought the formalin was responsible for the vaccine’s problems, but the chemical has been used safely in other vaccines.”  “The problem, they report this month in the journal Nature Medicine, was that the children’s antibodies were not binding strongly enough to the inactivated virus to produce a protective immune response,” the report noted. “Instead, the antibodies were dragging the dead virus with them, triggering a massive attack by other arms of the immune system.”  It should be noted that in 2019, the NIH admitted that “we are still lacking a safe and effective RSV vaccine.” But it somehow developed a “safe and effective” Covid-19 vaccine in a matter of months?  As noted before, the American public has no way of knowing if the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was rigorously tested, because the FDA refuses to fully release the documents for 75 years. A “whistleblower” on the inside of Pfizer’s clinical trials has documented many alleged serious issues, including “falsifying data.”  The phenomenon that Dr. Fauci is alluding to, “leaky vaccines,” has been well-documented. A Penn State University study showed that “leaky” vaccines can cause viruses to become lethal for the unvaccinated.  “Not all vaccines prevent infection,” PSU noted. “Some, known as leaky vaccines, prolong host survival or reduce disease symptoms without preventing viral replication and transmission. Although leaky vaccines provide anti-disease benefits to vaccinated individuals, new research by CIDD’s Andrew Read, David Kennedy and colleagues at the Avian Oncogenic Virus Group in the United Kingdom, and The University of New England in Australia, has demonstrated that leaky vaccines can make the situation for unvaccinated individuals worse.”  “Leaky vaccines work by enhancing host immunity to a particular pathogen, without necessarily blocking or slowing viral replication,” the article continues. “The result is that infected but vaccinated individuals have extended survival, allowing highly virulent pathogen that would normally reach an evolutionary dead-end in a dead host, can transmit. The evolutionary consequences of high virulence are thus reduced and these pathogens can be selectively favored as a result of leaky vaccination. ”  A 2019 article in Healthline discussed the attempt to prevent Marek’s disease from spreading among chickens.  “After experiments done in a specialized pathogen-containment facility at The Pirbright Institute in the United Kingdom, the researchers concluded that the vaccines developed to combat Marek’s disease were imperfect or leaky,” the story notes.  “These vaccines also allow the virulent virus to continue evolving precisely because they allow the vaccinated individuals, and therefore themselves, to survive,” said Venugopal Nair, who led the research team.  “These less-than-perfect vaccines create a ‘leaky’ barrier against the virus,” the story continues. “Vaccinated individuals may get sick but have less severe symptoms, but the virus survives long enough to transmit to others, which allows it to survive and spread throughout a population.”  “Our research demonstrates that the use of leaky vaccines can promote the evolution of nastier ‘hot’ viral strains that put unvaccinated individuals at greater risk,” Nair said.  A new Harvard study recently showed that the mRNA “vaccines” endorsed by the FDA and CDC are worse than useless at stopping the spread of Covid-19.  The study of 68 nations and 2,947 counties in the United States published in the European Journal of Epidemiology showed that “At the country-level, there appears to be no discernable relationship between percentage of population fully vaccinated and new COVID-19 cases in the last 7 days. In fact, the trend line suggests a marginally positive association such that countries with higher percentage of population fully vaccinated have higher COVID-19 cases per 1 million people.”  That is exactly what Becker News had pointed out in September:  As the Covid pandemic continues to defy predictions about when it will finally be ‘over,’ there is a curious phenomenon taking place across the United States and around the globe: Covid-19 case rates increasing alongside vaccination rates. The textbook examples of this disturbing trend are the nations of Israel, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Israel is now experiencing its fourth wave, which is being accompanied by another round of ‘booster shots.’ Israel has 61.5% of all adults “fully vaccinated” (although the use of ‘booster shots’ throws the term into question.)  Meanwhile, a new independent study corroborates the famous Israeli study from August that shows natural immunity is superior to “vaccinated immunity.”  The latest study states that: “Confirmed infection rates increased according to time elapsed since the last immunity-conferring event in all cohorts. For unvaccinated previously infected individuals they increased from 10.5 per 100,000 risk-days for those previously infected 4-6 months ago to 30.2 for those previously infected over a year ago. For individuals receiving a single dose following prior infection they increased from 3.7 per 100,000 person days among those vaccinated in the past two months to 11.6 for those vaccinated over 6 months ago. For vaccinated previously uninfected individuals the rate per 100,000 person days increased from 21.1 for persons vaccinated within the first two months to 88.9 for those vaccinated more than 6 months ago.”  Thus, the vaccinated previously uninfected individuals are two-to-three times more likely to be reinfected after six months than unvaccinated previously infected individuals. One of the more useful aspects of this study is that it unpacks the overlap between vaccinated immunity and natural immunity; some research suggests the overlap between the two categories may be as high as 60-70%. Therefore, claims about “vaccinated immunity” may be benefiting from the fact that over half of the United States is estimated to have natural immunity.  The latest remarks from Dr. Fauci suggest that the NIAID chief is not surprised by the abysmal failure of the “vaccines” to stop the spread. Indeed, one wonders if it was all a “part of the plan.”  The Wildfire Newsletter is a free and paid subscription service provided by independent journalist Kyle Becker.

440,188400114705260793737092814606599394686,"‘Even if children and adolescents and people in their 20s are infected, it is naturally mild or asymptomatic,’ Japanese drug bulletin Med Check said. ‘It is a ridiculous to consider vaccination for school children.’  OSAKA, Japan (LifeSiteNews) – COVID vaccines may pose at least a seven times higher risk of death than the virus itself for people in their 20s, a Japanese medical bulletin warns.  A review in the most recent issue of Med Check, a bimonthly bulletin published by the Japan Institute of Pharmacovigilance (NOPJIP) as a member of the International Society of Drug Bulletins (ISDB), found that the death risk of the jabs may even be as high as 40 times greater for young people.  Med Check cited three reports of individuals between the ages of 20 and 29 who died within days or weeks of vaccination, estimating the death rate for that age group at 3.2 per 1 million. One of the apparent vaccine deaths was that of a 27-year-old professional baseball player, who collapsed eight days after getting jabbed and died after a month-long battle in a hospital.  The bulletin noted that the number of deaths may be higher, in part because the Japanese government only requires reports of suspected vaccine injuries within 28 days of injection. The Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare received a total of 1,308 reports of deaths after COVID vaccination by October 15.  Even with just three cases, the risk of a fatal reaction to the vaccine significantly outpaced the danger of the virus for young people, who have a 0.6-0.8 per 1 million chance of dying from the disease in Japan, according to Med Check. Just seven of 11.8 million Japanese people in their 20s died of COVID by June 2021, and 10 died by mid-August.  Risk of death from vaccination was more than seven times higher as of June, and nearly five times higher by August 11, compared to the risk presented by coronavirus, Med Check determined. Over several years, death risk for vaccination among those in their 20s could range as high as 40 times greater than for COVID-19.  Med Check also pointed out that there were no COVID deaths in Japan under the age of 20 until September 2021. “If children in this age group are vaccinated, it may cause death,” the bulletin warned.  “Even if children and adolescents and people in their 20s are infected, it is naturally mild or asymptomatic because they have less SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 than adults especially old people. It is a ridiculous to consider vaccination for school children.”  Between 0.00 and 0.03 percent of COVID cases in the United States under age 18 have resulted in deaths, and zero healthy children between the ages of 5 and 18 died of the virus during the first 15 months of the pandemic in Germany, a recent study found.  The survival rate for COVID-19 has been estimated at no lower than 99.7 percent for all age groups under 60 years old.  Med Check’s analysis echoes similar assessments by other experts, such as Dr. Jessica Rose, a viral immunologist who told an FDA panel in September that the jab’s dangers “outweigh any potential benefit,” citing a “highly anomalous” rise in vaccine injury reports due to the injections.  “We could end up killing thousands of our children with these safety untested vaccines,” health researcher and former Trump official Dr. Paul Elias Alexander likewise warned in an article for LifeSiteNews. “There is no proper safety data, either medium or long term, and parents must stand up now and say NO!”  Share","Vaccines pose 7 times higher death risk than COVID for young people, Japanese experts warn",false
441,49502616749902706969724397347051491962,"Cabal leaders go to Antarctica to surrender to Extraterrestrials & Earth Alliance  [Important Update Below] News has recently emerged of global elites (aka cabal) going to Antarctica for a secret meeting. We know from public tweets that Claus Schwab, Founder and Executive Chairman of the World Economic Forum, and Cristina Lagarde, President of the European Central Bank attended a secret Antarctica meeting. Two others present were Brad Garlinghouse and David Schwartz, respectively the President and Chief Technical Officer of Ripple Labs, a computer software company specializing in online payment systems.  The four tweets by the above elites, which began with Lagarde tweeting back in July 2021 that she was going to attend a meeting in Antarctica, has generated much speculation. To learn more about the Antarctica meetings, I contacted Elena Danaan to find out if her off-planet sources could supply answers to what was really happening in Antarctica.  Elena received answers from Thor Han Eredyon, a Commander with the Galactic Federation of Worlds, and Oona from the Intergalactic Confederation (aka the Guardians). The answers were stunning. It appears that a major turning point has been reached and global elites are being summoned to Antarctica to meet a delegation of extraterrestrial races and Earth Alliance leaders to negotiate the terms of their surrender.  Antarctica was chosen for the meeting because it contains a portal that can transport global elites to a distant world in another galaxy where they will be well provisioned, but forever banished.  Prior to leaving for the new world, however, they have to first help the transition of the global financial system, and to undo much of the black magic that has been cast to keep humanity and the Earth itself in bondage.  Here is the first message Elena (E) received from Thor Han (TH) on December 14 about what transpired at the Antarctica meeting.  TH: By the decision of the High Council of the GFW, following the recent agreements set on Jupiter between the Earth Space Alliance and the Galactic Federation of Worlds, the Council of Five and the Zenatean Alliance.  The Terran elites under enemy leadership complied to meet on the southern continent, with our representatives, in order to hand over to the Earth Alliance their powers upon the global financial system. This ancient system is to be replaced by the new system that is to be put in place by the Earth Alliance. They are being offered, in exchange, a life off-world with all commodities.  E: Why are they not just judged for their misdeeds and sentenced accordingly?  TH: They only can unwind the dark web they created, for they cast into the foundations of your societies the anchors of great immorality. It was decided with the Terran high hierarchy of the Earth Alliance, that no greater chaos would unfold from these transfers of power, as an economic collapse would add even more suffering to these challenging times for the Terran people, already greatly wounded. The GFW and the Earth Alliance are making sure that this transition will cause the least damage as possible.  E: Does this concern only changes in the financial system?  TH: Industrial domains are interdependent with the financial system. Be prepared to witness surprising changes in the matter of new energy systems and the rolling out of technologies in many sectors.  E: Why were you on Jupiter these last days? And just back on the very same day when these meetings in Antarctica are leaked?  TH: I told you there were meetings on Jupiter. The dark elites weren’t there, they would not be tolerated in the Shari facility (Ashtar GC). The dark ones met on Antarctica’s land with our envoys. The latest meetings on Jupiter were about those I just mentioned, with the leadership of the Earth Alliance only. These meetings were completed today, Terran time. This is the statement I can give to you, with my superiors’ blessings. Did Oona contact you?  E: Yes, she did.  TH: Then she knows more details than I do, at least for now. I shall speak to you again in the coming hours. You can of course tell Dr. Michael, and give him my fond salutations.  E: I surely will, thank you, Thor Han.  Thor Han’s message gives us a clear idea of what really transpired in Antarctica. The global elites summoned there met with a delegation of leaders from different extraterrestrial organizations and the Earth Alliance that participated in the Jupiter Accords signed in July 2021. The elites were required to come up with a plan for a smooth economic transition to a more equitable monetary system and prevent a global financial collapse.  This is supported by the tweets by the two senior officials from Ripple Labs, Schwartz and Garlinghouse. Their presence and expertise signaled that what was being negotiated in Antarctica involved a new online payment system.  Could this be linked to a Quantum Financial System (QFS) that has been a topic of much speculation? According to one source, Nigel Matte, the coming QFS would be linked to a quantum internet that will be created through the Starlink Satellite system being created by Elon Musk’s SpaceX. Schwartz and Garlinghouse would have the necessary expertise to help plans for a smooth transition from the current global financial system to a QFS linked to quantum cloud computing.  Thor Han pointed out that the implications for multiple industries will be enormous starting with the energy sector. Indeed, abandoning fossil fuels is the key to unleashing a multitude of alternative energy technologies that have been suppressed since the early 1900s. Similarly, many other suppressed technologies such as electromagnetic and holographic healing modalities will be also released, thereby replacing the soon to be discredited pharmaceutical industry, as a result of national populations rebelling against mandatory vaccine policies and big pharma support for these.  It’s worth keeping in mind that there are currently over 5900 patents that are suppressed in the US alone due to national security orders imposed by the intelligence community. The bulk of these suppressed patents involve alternative energy and healing technologies. When in January 2017, President Donald Trump issued a Top Secret Memorandum for the release of 1000 of these patents over the next two years, he was ignored by the intelligence community, and his administration subsequently targeted.  Interestingly, the cabal was not allowed to travel to the headquarters of the Ashtar Galactic Command where the Jupiter Accords were first negotiated between 14 spacefaring nations led by the US, with representatives of the Galactic Community. This is a big indicator of how the situation in our solar system has dramatically changed with the expulsion of the Ciakahrr (Draconian) Empire and Orion (Gray) Collective forces, and Earth’s cabal being isolated from their former patrons.  After his first response, Thor Han sent additional information to Elena about the meetings he was attending on Jupiter:  TH: Another aspect of my presence on Jupiter was to discuss this phenomenon which very recently occurred in the vicinity of your star system: a collapse of the 3rd Density continuum. This occurs in pockets in the fabric of space and your star system is entering one of these on its trajectory through this arm of the galaxy. More 3rd Density collapsing will occur, as a bridge to the 5th Density. The enemy and the dark ones know about it, they knew it was happening and it is one of the reasons why they knew for a long time that they had lost this star system. I will tell you more later.  Thor Han’s message corroborates that our solar system has entered a region of space which possesses a galactic anomaly that greatly impacts third density space. In 2014, scientists confirmed that our solar system was about to enter a large interstellar cloud called “the local fluff”, which is approximately 30 light-years wide and held together by a very large magnetic field.  According to various researchers, this interstellar cloud was first observed back in 1961 around the Pleiades constellation and called a ‘photon belt’—due to the white halo it projected. One of the “Photon Belt” advocates was Noel Huntley, Ph.D., who wrote an article in 2010 titled “The Photon Belt Encounter” where he described its existence and great interest to extraterrestrials:  What is this electromagnetic cloud, this golden nebula, sometimes referred to as the radiant nebula by ETs? Its more universal designation is ’photon belt’ or ’photon band ’, consisting of many bands, and any encounter with this belt is recognized by extraterrestrials as of great import.    According to Thor Han’s information, Dr. Huntley was correct and the region of space we have entered will accelerate consciousness from a materialistic third density existence to a fifth density existence. According to the Law of One material, “fifth density is perhaps best described as extremely white in vibration.” Therefore the “photon belt” is not an inaccurate description of this 5th density region despite what many critics have to say about the term.  If humanity’s collective consciousness was not sufficiently developed to accommodate fifth density frequencies, it would implode in a self-induced global calamity. If humanity’s consciousness evolved, however, a golden age of wisdom, love and peace would begin.  Thor Han is making clear that the global elites understood that the battle for Earth had been lost, and they wanted no part of what was coming. Hence their willingness to cooperate in the transition to a new Earth in order to be able to use the Antarctica portal to leave forever to another planet.  In a second follow up message sent on December 14, Thor Han communicated with Elena and shared more information about this “photon belt” (aka local fluff) and how the Jupiter Accords gave the global elite five months to surrender to the Earth Alliance. Thor Han said:  TH: I am going to talk about this natural phenomenon occurring in the vicinity of your star system. This is not an isolated phenomenon; as your star system moves throughout the grid of this galaxy, composed of fluctuating waves of frequencies, you encounter pockets of higher vibrational density of matter. What does it mean: the physical laws binding the atoms together oscillate at a faster rate. It is not about time, do you understand, the time rate doesn’t change, only the perception you have of it, because your rate changes. It is not about time but only about the physicality of the fabric of space that shifts. As the universal laws of physics function, it happens that this phenomenon occurs progressively, unless the pocket of higher density is as big or bigger than the said star system. The limit of a density zone is not sharp but fuzzy. You enter into it progressively, by encountering “bubbles” until you completely merge into the new area.  E: What happens when Earth will cross through one of these higher density zones, or bubbles?  TH: Nothing near a dramatic event, such as many Terrans imagine with fear could happen. It manifests as a change in consciousness as the perceptions, mental and physical, shift into a higher range. Physical symptoms can occur, those who have prepared their mind openly follow the wave but for those who are not ready and resist it, it translates for them by physical and mental suffering. The vision changes, the perceptions change, especially the perception of linear time, that is perceived as faster. But you know, this process, entering through this new area in Nataru, is inevitable. So Terrans need to truly let go of any resistance, such as the greatest, that is fear.  Thor Han has here confirmed that our solar system’s movement into the “photon belt” (“local fluff”) is not something that heralds physical destruction, but instead signals a speeding up of consciousness. Those individuals sufficiently prepared emotionally and mentally will be able to surf the coming galactic waves and manifest a new reality—the proverbial Kingdom of Heaven on Earth. Those that are not prepared will do the opposite, and experience more great stress and turmoil in their personal and collective lives.  Thor Han continued his second follow up message as follows:  E: Going back to Antarctica, what else can you tell me? I don’t like these guys, they are the embodiment of evil. They have caused so much suffering.  TH: They won’t anymore. When the Jupiter agreements took place, they received a warning that we would meet in five months and they would have to prepare to surrender. So they knew this and that is why they are pushing all their agendas at once, with despair. But your people is starting to see that.  E: Wait, why give them five months?  TH: For the transition. This meeting is a turning point for them, and for you. If we had suppressed them all at once, the financial and economical systems on Terra would have imploded in a terrible chaos. There are better ways. They are summoned to transfer to the Alliance their keys and tools, in order to make the transition as smooth as possible for the population.  Something else that is worth mentioning, is that they have been taught dark aetherical arts and the spells need to be undone. This will undo their power. It is powerless that they will leave this world. Because they will leave. You know, when I mentioned transition, I meant to say that Terrans need to see the faces of their enemy, in order to open their consciousness to the truth. However painful this process is, it is necessary.  E: It reminds me what the Nine told me recently, that every sentient being has a role to play in the games of the evolution of the universe.  Th: That is exact. You know, when I stayed in the Himalayan base, four years ago, I witnessed great plans being prepared for the awakening of the Terrans. The time war was the main concern. Imagine a time war like a multi layered chess board. There is no better way to describe it to you.  Thor Han’s reference to the global elites use of the “dark aetherical arts and the spells” is very significant. He is referring to a little understood aspect of the global elite’s control system which is the use of black magic to undergird all their activities. Thor Han is confirming here what several researchers have revealed in the past, the cabal routinely uses black magic as part of their global control system.  A good example is how the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) routinely used magical symbols for the public Space Program as documented by Richard Hoagland and Mike Bara in their best selling 2009 book, Dark Mission: The Secret History of NASA.    What we also learned from President Vladimir Putin and a military intelligence group associated with the Q movement (a movement linked to the 17th letter of the alphabet) was that the global elite are practicing ‘Satanists’ who conjure up the power of demonic and other negative entities to subjugate humanity and the spirit of the planet. In this regard, what Putin effectively said in his 2013 State of the Nation Address was “the New World Order Worships Satan.”    These dark magic ceremonies are routinely held at different energy vortexes or ‘sacred sites’ around the planet as revealed by many occult researchers such as Fritz Springmeier in his book series, Bloodlines of the Illuminati. More recently, Brad Olsen, a highly competent researcher and author, also revealed many of these black magic/Satanist practices in his book series Beyond Esoteric:  There is a complete control over the human race, and to think that black magic could be used to control the masses is disturbing. The occult is employed in a new kind of fascism today among some of the elite globalists, who completely control almost every aspect of our lives, from health and finance to politics and education…. Research indicates that occult ceremonies and rituals at the upper levels go far beyond what anyone can imagine…. Why is it so hard to believe that occult practices are a real tool for control? (p. 55).  Importantly, Thor Han pointed out the explicit connection between the Jupiter Accords signed in July and the Antarctica meetings held five months later. A provision of the Accords was the surrender of the global elite by December 2021. This timeline is corroborated by Christine Lagarde’s July tweet that meetings were to be held in Antarctica in December. Her tweet is compelling evidence that the cabal had indeed been given five months to prepare to hand over their power, without collapsing the world financial system as a condition for their leaving Earth through the Antarctica intergalactic portal.  This negotiated surrender and departure of the cabal signals an incredible new time lies ahead as the world transitions to new financial, political, health, and energy systems that will revolutionize life. The message from Oona, one of the Guardians, provides yet more details into the incredible planetary transitions we are soon about to witness. I will analyze her message in Part 2 of this series.  A video version of this article is available on YouTube & Rumble  I wish to thank Elena Danaan for permission to publicly release Thor Han’s messages. Her website is here.    © Michael E.

The four tweets first appeared on the twitter account of XRP the Standard Productions on December 3. They were then reposted in an article published on The Void on December 7, which I used as my source for the above article. Two of the tweets were then posted by Ben Fulford on his site on Dec 13, 2021. Joseph Farrell cited the Void article and referred to Klaus Schwab tweet on Dec 13. I posted the above article discussing the four tweets on Dec 16. The XRP site posts satirical stories, and takes pride in misinforming people. Unfortunately, regarding the four Antarctica tweets, this does cast considerable doubt on their authenticity. However, disinformation is designed to muddy the waters about real events, and something did genuinely happen in Antarctica as one of the four sources, David Schwartz, is actively posting about his recent trip there. So we know one of the four twitter sources did go to Antarctica. Did Klaus Schwab and Christine Lagarde also go there? Now we don’t know. This unfortunate development does not diminish the accuracy of the information relayed by Elena Danaan from her source Thor Han about what has recently happened in Antarctica. All it does is cast confusion and misdirection in an already difficult field to research. While I did conduct some due diligence on the four twitter posts, it plainly wasn’t good enough.

But data doesn’t support its safety and health practitioners around the world are sounding the alarm.  A Canadian doctor, who has effectively treated COVID patients with Ivermectin throughout, urges pregnant women to abstain from getting the COVID injections.  Speaking to a reporter in November, Dr. Daniel Nagase argues COVID vaccines are directly attributed to an alarming increase in stillbirths across Canada.  TRENDING: EVIL: SNL 'Jokes' About Gang F***ing Roger Stone's 75-Year-Old Wife Who Has Cancer (VIDEO)  Doulas who work in women and children’s hospitals in one of the birthing centers for Vancouver “had 13 stillbirths in a 24-hour period,” Nagase contends.  “In Waterloo, Ontario, I have a more reliable statistic,” he continued. “There were 86 stillbirths between January and July. Normally, it’s only five or six stillbirths every year. So, about one stillbirth every two months is the usual rate. To suddenly get to 86 stillbirths in six months, that’s highly unusual,” he continued. “But the most important confirmation that we have from the Waterloo, Ontario report was that all of the 86 stillbirths were fully vaccinated.  “We are seeing a correlation and certainly when you see a correlation, you have to start asking, ‘In the water in Waterloo, is there something? Is there something in the air? Is there some toxin in the food supply? But when you see the same correlation in different parts of the country – in Vancouver and then in Waterloo, and you see an increase in stillbirths. You have to ask yourself what is going on that is both in Waterloo, Ontario and Vancouver that is suddenly causing an increase in stillbirths?”  Taxpayer-funded hospitals must be held accountable, Nagase argued.  “We need to get Freedom of Information Requests. We need doctors, nurses, unit clerks at hospitals to start printing out the statistics because we know if we ask the health authorities to print out the statistics they will refuse and that is absolutely criminal because who pays for the hospitals? We do. It is our information– we own that information,” he said. “We should not be asking some administrator for permission to get the death statistics. We should not have to ask some kind of health minister for permission to get the actual rate of [intensive care unit] stays. They’re saying it’s ‘unvaccinated people,’ but there are so many people who are within 2 weeks of their second shot and they getting deathly ill. This information is our information.  “We deserve to know how many percent of the ICU is filled with people who are having side effects within one week of the injection. And then, if they are clogging the ICUs because they are getting a vaccine injury, but then they’re being labeled as unvaccinated, that is an absolute lie.”  On Nov. 30, Dr. Nagase and Dr. Mel Bruchet launched an investigation into Lions Gate Hospital in North Vancouver to verify why claims alleged by doulas about the influx of stillbirths among COVID-vaccinated mothers.  “Nagase launched an official complaint with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police against executives at the College of Physicians & Surgeons of BC, alleging conflicts of interest influencing their policies, decisions and statements made to the people of British Columbia,” Fox 26 reports.  The CDC maintains there is no increased risk of miscarriages among those who’ve been vaccinated, however, the former Pfizer vice president Dr. Michael Yeadon has corroborated the claims made by Nagase and a multitude of health practitioners underfire for warning against COVID injections.  “We never, ever give experimental medicines to pregnant women,” said Yeadon warned in August during a “Stop the Shot” conference hosted by Life Site News. “You never, ever give inadequately tested medicines, medicinal products, to a pregnant woman. And that is exactly what is happening. Our government is urging pregnant women, and women of childbearing age, to get vaccinated. And they’re telling them they’re safe. And that’s a lie because those studies have simply not been done.”    Yeadon, who holds degrees in biochemistry, toxicology, and a Ph.D. in respiratory pharmacology and launched his own biotech company after working in the pharmaceutical industry for 32 years. The former Pfizer executive called attention to a Japanese study that found high concentrations of the spike protein in the ovaries when tested on mRNA vaccine injected rats.  “What we find is the vaccine [in rats] doesn’t just distribute around the body and then wash out again, which is what you’d hope,” he said. “It concentrates in ovaries of rats, and it concentrates at least 20-fold over the concentration in other background tissues like muscles.  “You don’t want this product in your ovaries. It’s simply not necessary to induce immunity to have a vaccine in your ovaries. And, as it’s concentrating in the ovaries, getting higher concentrations over time, they have not even defined what the maximum levels are or when that occurs.”","(VIDEO) Doctor Warns Stillbirths Are Rampant Among Fully Vaccinated Mothers, Launches Investigation",false

(Source.)  The vast majority of these have been from the Pfizer shot (1,862 deaths) and the Moderna shot (656 deaths.)  There have been more fetal deaths in the past 11 months following COVID-19 shots than there have been for the past 30+ years following ALL vaccines (2,198 – Source.)  Last month (October, 2021) the New England Journal of Medicine admitted that the original study used to justify the CDC and the FDA in recommending the shots to pregnant women was flawed. (Source.)  Since then, researchers in New Zealand have conducted a new study on the original data, and concluded:  A re-analysis of these figures indicates a cumulative incidence of spontaneous abortion ranging from 82% (104/127) to 91% (104/114), 7–8 times higher than the original authors’ results. (Source.)  And yet, the CDC and FDA still continue to recommend the shots for pregnant women, even though a correct analysis on the original data shows that 82% to 91% of pregnant women will suffer miscarriages if their unborn child is less than 20 weeks old. (Source.)  VAERS is a passive system that is severely under reported. The CDC and FDA have never conducted a study to determine what this under-reported factor is, but independent scientists have, and we have previously published the analysis conducted by Dr. Jessica Rose, who has determined that a conservative under-reported factor would be X41. See:  This means that there have probably been at least 99,753 fetal deaths following COVID-19 injections so far.  Here is a video report we made on this last month with some very unfortunate gruesome examples of what these shots are doing to unborn babies.  Related:  UPDATE – November 7, 2021 PM  A couple of hours after publishing this article, a video that has been circulating on the Internet of an interview with a Funeral Director in the UK became known to me.  He has been in practice for over 3 years and is identified as “Wesley,” and was interviewed by a group called “Resistance GB.”  He claims that last fall was one the slowest periods of seeing deaths for all funeral directors, but when the COVID-19 shots were introduced, deaths started dramatically increasing.  It started with the elderly, but then by April they were seeing large numbers of people in their 30s and 40s. Many of them were dying of myocarditis.  Now, they are seeing unprecedented numbers of newborn babies, and they are piling up in hospital refrigerators. Some are full term, some are pre-term, he claims.  The UK originally recommended that pregnant women and nursing mothers should NOT get the experimental COVID shots, but like the CDC in the U.S., they eventually changed their recommendation to encourage pregnant women to get the shots.

The problem with this is official data shows the alleged Delta variant has been evading the Covid-19 vaccines for at least the 3 past months, because since August 2021 the fully vaccinated have accounted for 9 in every 10, Covid-19 deaths.  Public Health Scotland (PHS) publish a weekly report on Covid-19 statistics which includes data on cases, hospitalisations and deaths by vaccination status.  The report includes data over a period of four weeks and the latest statistics were published by PHS on December 1st 2021, including data on cases and hospitalisations from 30th October to 26th November 2021, and data on deaths from 23rd October to 19th November 2021.  By analysing the data contained within the report alongside data from previous reports that stretches as far back as August 14th 2021, we can see that Scotland has very much been experiencing a ‘Pandemic of the Fully Vaccinated’ since at least August.  Proving the introduction of new restrictions has nothing to do with the worry that the new Omicron variant may impact the effectivenes of the Covid-19 vaccines, and instead has everything to do with control, because the jabs have proven to be ineffective for months.  Covid-19 Cases  Table 19 of the latest ‘Covid-19 Statistical Report’ shows the number of Covid-19 cases per week by vaccination status. We’ve created the following chart on the published data from several reports, including the most recent published December 1st.  As you can see from the above the unvaccinated population accounted for the majority of cases every week between August 21st and September 17th, but since then the fully vaccinated have accounted for the majority of cases every week. However, by including the number of cases among the partly vaccinated population we find that the vaccinated population have in fact accounted for the majority of Covid-19 cases since at least August 21st.  The above chart shows the cumulative number of cases per week by vaccination status between August 21st and November 26th. Here we can see that something significant happened in the week beginning 16th October in regard to the number of cases accumulating among the unvaccinated and fully vaccinated populations, in that the number of cases were beginning to fall among the unvaccinated whilst increasing significantly among the fully vaccinated.  Official data shows that between August 21st and November 26th there were 142,945 cases among the unvaccinated population, 30,204 cases among the partly vaccinated population, and 165,008 cases among the fully vaccinated, bringing the total number of cases among the vaccinated population in this time frame to 195,212.  Covid-19 Hospitalisations  Table 20 of the latest ‘Covid-19 Statistical Report’ shows the number of Covid-19 hospitalisations per week by vaccination status. We’ve created the following chart on the published data from several reports, including the most recent published December 1st.  As you can see from the above the data proves that it is the fully vaccinated population who have been putting a strain on the healthcare system and not the unvaccinated as the authorities and mainstream media would have you believe.  The above chart shows the cumulative number of hospitalisations per week by vaccination status between August 21st and November 26th, in which there were 2,531 hospitalisations among the unvaccinated population but more twice the among among the vaccinated population, who recorded 6,094 hospitalisations.  Covid-19 Deaths  Table 21 of the latest ‘Covid-19 Statistical Report’ shows the number of Covid-19 deaths per week by vaccination status. We’ve created the following chart on the published data from several reports, including the most recent published December 1st.  The data shows that the fully vaccinated have accounted for the vast majority of Covid-19 deaths by a long way since at least August 14th. In the past four weeks along there were just 59 deaths among the unvaccinated population whilst 407 deaths occurred among the vaccinated population.  This means the vaccinated population accounted for 9 in every 10 Covid-19 deaths between October 23rd and November 19th.  The above chart shows the cumulative number of deaths per week by vaccination status between August 14th and November 19th, in which there were just 219 deaths among the unvaccinated population, but 1,280 deaths among the vaccinated population.  This data suggests that the fully vaccinated are 144% more likely to die once hospitalisated with Covid-19 based on the hospitalisation/fatality rates that can be calculated from the statistics.  With 2,531 hospitalisations and 219 deaths among the unvaccinated population this equates to a hospitalisation/fatality rate of 8.6%.  But with 6,094 hospitalisations and 1,280 deaths among the vaccinated population this equates to a hospitalisation/fataity rate of 21%.  Pandemic of the Fully Vaccinated  The data available from Public Health Scotland stretching back 14 weeks proves very much that this is a pandemic of the fully vaccinated, and with the vaccinated accounting for 6 in every 10 cases (57%), 7 in every 10 hospitalisations (70%), and 9 in every 10 Covid-19 deaths (85%) since at least August, this also proves that the Covid-19 vaccines have already been ineffective for months.  Therefore any restrictions enforced in the name of protecting the public from the alleged new Omicron variant have absolutely nothing to do with protecting your health, and instead everything to do with control.

This is now fact, not speculation.  More people have died from the COVID-19 vaccine than from all other vaccines over the last 20 years… COMBINED.  That’s right: the vaccine that is supposed to “protect” you from COVID is now responsible for killing more people than all the other vaccines put together.  Does that make you feel safe yet?  This isn’t our calculation.  This number has been confirmed by the CDC itself.

We’ve also been told to trust the science and to trust the experts.  Well… now the scientific experts at the CDC are telling us the vaccine is deadlier than all the other vaccines!  WND has a breakdown of the CDC’s revealing statement on their website:  There have been nearly as many deaths from complications following inoculation with the so-called Covid-19 “vaccines” as there have been for all previous vaccines total since Jan. 1, 2001. In fact, the data are five days old so the gap, which was at four on May 3, has almost certainly been bridged. According to the CDC website: “Over 245 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines were administered in the United States from Dec. 14, 2020, through May 3, 2021. During this time, VAERS received 4,178 reports of death (0.0017%) among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine. CDC and FDA physicians review each case report of death as soon as notified and CDC requests medical records to further assess reports.” The website went on to boldly proclaim that a “review of available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records has not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines.” This is important medical editorializing so as not to scare people. The CDC has a vested interest in getting as many people vaccinated as possible, so even when burying the important data about deaths at the bottom of a page intended to assuage concerns over these experimental drugs, they did so with every intention of making people take it.  Of course, the concern over the vaccine is nothing new.  Fox News’ Tucker Carlson has been raising legitimate questions.  However, after a segment last week questioning the vaccine, Carlson’s segment was BANNED from YouTube.  Fortunately, people have been ripping the segment and sharing it online.

As they should.  But similar to the 2020 presidential election, rather than answering these questions with transparency and integrity, people are refusing to talk about the numbers.  Fortunately for us, the numbers speak for themselves.  Conservative commentator David J. Harris, Jr. had this to say:  On Wednesday night’s episode of Fox News’ “Tucker Carlson Tonight” host Tucker Carlson asked a very important question: “How many Americans have died after taking the COVID vaccines? Not Americans who’ve been killed by the virus, that’s a huge number, but how many Americans have died after getting the vaccines designed to prevent the virus? Do you know the answer to that question? Do you know anything about the downside? We know a lot about the upside of the vaccine. We’ve been completely in favor of vulnerable people taking vaccines.” With our federal government teetering on the edge of going full authoritarian concerning getting the COVID vaccine, do you know all the risks involved? President Joe Biden was on television Tuesday talking about vaccines, about how he wants us all to get one. In fact, everyone with authority wants you to get the COVID vaccine and they are starting to apply enormous pressure for people like me who have been holding out to get the shot. The Biden administration has said that they won’t force COVID vaccine passports or anything like that but when he said that Dr. Fauci also indicated, or was it a dog whistle, to institutions and corporations that they would start using some form of a COVID vaccine passport to let you into the building or use their services. You may not be able to fly on an airplane or go to work or even educate your children if you don’t get the vaccine. Friends and family members may tell you that you’re not welcome at their homes or events if you have not yet been vaccinated. Okay, so a lot of you are contemplating on getting the vaccine because you don’t want to have to deal with the immense pressure being applied on you, but before you get that shot, do you know anything at all about the possible risks of getting the shot? You probably don’t know what I’m about to tell you, and you should know because it’s your life we’re talking about. People don’t normally associate vaccines with causing serious problems, even fatalities, because vaccines for the most part are not dangerous, at least according to the numbers. About 160 million Americans get the flu shot each year, as do I, proving that I am not an anti-vaxxer. I just have questions about the COVID vaccine that I can’t really find too many people to answer. Tucker said, “Every year, a relatively small number of people seem to die after getting those shots. To be precise, in 2019, that number was 203 people. The year before, it was 119. In 2017, a total of 85 people died from the flu shot.” Out of 160 million people who get the flu shot, those numbers of people who died, every one of them being tragic to their loved ones, aren’t significant enough for the rest of us to consider not getting the flu shot. Carlson wanted to know how many people have died from getting the COVID vaccine: “We checked today. Here’s the answer, which comes from the same set of government numbers that we just listed: Between late December of 2020, and last month, a total of 3,362 people apparently died after getting the COVID vaccines in the United States. Three thousand, three hundred and sixty-two — that’s an average of 30 people every day. So, what does that add up to? By the way, that reporting period ended on April 23. We don’t have numbers past that, we’re not quite up to date. But we can assume that another 360 people have died in the 12 days since. That is a total of 3,722 deaths. Almost four thousand people died after getting the COVID vaccines. The actual number is almost certainly much higher than that — perhaps vastly higher.” [emphasis added] GET THE TRUTH: DailyTruthReport.com How come no one is talking about that? Do doctors and other medical personnel now instinctively know that you’re not supposed to talk about anything that violates the Woke Supremacy’s stance on COVID? This is our lives we’re talking about.  These are legitimate questions.  And these are serious concerns.  So why aren’t our “leaders” more willing to be transparent?  If they really want to earn the trust of the American people, perhaps they should begin with full transparency and integrity to the public.

Bush, with the latter requesting a continuance to gather exculpatory evidence.  Counselors of the law firm Williams & Conolly arrived at Guantanamo Bay Friday, five days ahead of Bush’s tribunal date, arguing that the military had given them inadequate time to prepare a defense. Senior Counsel David D. Aufhauser asserted Bush’s innocence but demanded an additional 90 days to prepare a rebuttal to, what he called, the military’s specious allegations. Moreover, they said JAG’s seizure of documents and electronic devices from Bush’s Crawford ranch violated his 4th Amendment rights, and, therefore, ought to be inadmissible in courts of law.  Lt. Dawn Cusumano, a junior member of JAG’s National Security Litigation team, noted that Bush’s arrest took place on 11 November, giving his legal team nearly a month to mount a defense, and asked why, if Bush were innocent, they needed three more months.  “Because your office has fabricated flagrantly bogus charges on our client,” Aufhauser said.  “Mr. Aufhauser, if you’re prepared to accuse our offices of manufacturing evidence to wrongfully prosecute your client, well, those are serious allegations, ones you should be prepared to back up. Rear Adm. Crandall is patient, but he doesn’t tolerate foolery,” Lt. Cusumano said.  Aufhauser wanted to know why JAG hadn’t shared its discovery file with the defense team.  “This is not a civilian court; it’s a military commission. We’re not obligated to, and what we have shared, we’ve done for professional courtesy,” Lt. Cusumano replied.  Aufhauser then asked to speak with Rear Adm. Crandall, saying he felt personally slighted because JAG had sent “only a lieutenant” to evaluate his request.  Lt. Cusumano excused herself from the conference room, telling Aufhauser she’d make a phone call, only to return a minute later with Rear Adm. Crandall’s response.  Request denied.  “This is outrageous,” Aufhauser barked, “we’ll see him in court.”  Bush’s tribunal will commence at GITMO on Wednesday morning.",George W. Bush Denied Tribunal Extension,false
452,243860664657437129115243375517318764074,"An American who founded an animal rescue clinic in Kabul is still in Afghanistan, trying to persuade the Taliban to let her retrieve animals released by the U.S. military and airlift them out of the country with the clinic's employees.  Charlotte Maxwell-Jones was unable to board a military evacuation flight with the animals or charter a private aircraft before international troops left earlier this week.  The U.S. military released the clinic's animals from their cages in an enclosed area at the Kabul airport that had previously been used by the former Afghan army, Maxwell-Jones and a Pentagon statement said.  Maxwell-Jones founded Kabul Small Animal Rescue in 2018 to rescue strays, provide veterinary services and help ship animals abroad for adoption. American service members who befriended animals during their deployments and wanted to bring them home have been among her most steady clientele.  The Tennessee native has vowed to stay until she secures the evacuation of her staff, their family members and up to 250 cats and dogs. Maxwell-Jones said she has had eight charter planes canceled in recent days, costing her a substantial amount of money in nonrefundable deposits.  The entire group arrived at the airport together last week, but Taliban guards initially allowed only Maxwell-Jones and the dogs to enter. The employees were told to wait with the cats, she said.  In the end, only nine of the over 125 people associated with the clinic made it through the gates and left Afghanistan, she said. The cats returned to the clinic with staff members.  “Despite an ongoing complicated and retrograde mission, U.S. forces went to great lengths to assist the Kabul Small Animal Rescue as much as possible,” Army Lt. Col. Karen Roxberry, a spokeswoman for U.S. Central Command said in a statement Tuesday.  But Maxwell-Jones said the military provided a lot of “unnecessary pushback” once she was inside the airport.  “All the service members on the ground were very nice,” she said. “They helped take care of the animals; they took them out; they cuddled them. They were really, really great.  “But some of the higher-ups were like: ‘You’re using our resources. We need to get people out. Do you care about animals more than people?’ I didn’t ask to move animals instead of people. I said let’s move them in addition.”  The animals likely would have ridden in cargo spaces, she said.  Photos of some 125 dogs in carrier cages that Maxwell-Jones has been trying to ship out of Afghanistan have been circulating on social media along with accusations that American forces left their working dogs behind when they completed their withdrawal this week.  Pentagon spokesman John Kirby denied the accusations Tuesday, tweeting that the military left none of its dogs and that those photographed belonged to Kabul Small Animal Rescue.  The fate of the animals, about 50 of which Maxwell-Jones described as working dogs left in her care by contractors who supported the U.S. mission, remains unknown.  “There’s a decent chance that most of them are alive,” she said Tuesday in a phone interview, adding that she intends to work with the Taliban, who now control the airport, to retrieve the animals.  She remains hopeful of getting both animals and staffers out of Afghanistan in the coming weeks.  And while the employees wait to depart, they will continue to work, with an extra emphasis on rescuing more contractor working dogs that are believed to have been left behind, Maxwell-Jones said.",American rescue clinic founder stays in Afghanistan to pursue evacuation for staff and animals left behind,true
453,155162318731024885125315075182575857001,"The US government has deported people to face abuse and even death in El Salvador. The US is not solely responsible—Salvadoran gangs who prey on deportees and Salvadoran authorities who harm deportees or who do little or nothing to protect them bear direct responsibility—but in many cases the US is putting Salvadorans in harm’s way in circumstances where it knows or should know that harm is likely.  Of the estimated 1.2 million Salvadorans living in the United States who are not US citizens, just under one-quarter are lawful permanent residents, with the remaining three-quarters lacking papers or holding a temporary or precarious legal status. While Salvadorans have asylum recognition rates as high as 75 percent in other Central American nations, and 36.5 percent in Mexico, the US recognized just 18.2 percent of Salvadorans as qualifying for asylum from 2014 to 2018. Between 2014-2018, the US and Mexico have deported about 213,000 Salvadorans (102,000 from Mexico and 111,000 from the United States).  No government, UN agency, or nongovernmental organization has systematically monitored what happens to deported persons once back in El Salvador. This report begins to fill that gap. It shows that, as asylum and immigration policies tighten in the United States and dire security problems continue in El Salvador, the US is repeatedly violating its obligations to protect Salvadorans from return to serious risk of harm.  Some deportees are killed following their return to El Salvador. In researching this report, we identified or investigated 138 cases of Salvadorans killed since 2013 after deportation from the US. We found these cases by combing through press accounts and court files, and by interviewing surviving family members, community members, and officials. There is no official tally, however, and our research suggests that the number of those killed is likely greater.  Though much harder to identify because they are almost never reported by the press or to authorities, we also identified or investigated over 70 instances in which deportees were subjected to sexual violence, torture, and other harm, usually at the hands of gangs, or who went missing following their return.  In many of these more than 200 cases, we found a clear link between the killing or harm to the deportee upon return and the reasons they had fled El Salvador in the first place. In other cases, we lacked sufficient evidence to establish such a link. Even the latter cases, however, show the risks to which Salvadorans can be exposed upon return and the importance of US authorities giving them a meaningful opportunity to explain why they need protection before they are deported.  The following three cases illustrate the range of harms:  In 2010, when he was 17, Javier B. fled gang recruitment and his particularly violent neighborhood for the United States, where his mother, Jennifer B., had already fled. Javier was denied asylum and was deported in approximately March 2017, when he was 23 years old. Jennifer said Javier was killed four months later while living with his grandmother: “That’s actually where they [the gang, MS-13 (or Mara Salvatrucha-13)] killed him.… It’s terrible. They got him from the house at 11:00 a.m. They saw his tattoos. I knew they’d kill him for his tattoos. That is exactly what happened.… The problem was with [the gang] MS [-13], not with the police.” (According to Human Rights Watch’s research, having tattoos may be a source of concern, even if the tattoo is not gang-related).  In 2013, cousins Walter T. and Gaspar T. also fled gang recruitment when they were 16 and 17 years old, respectively. They were denied asylum and deported by the United States to El Salvador in 2019. Gaspar explained that in April or May 2019 when he and Walter were sleeping at their respective homes in El Salvador, a police patrol arrived “and took me and Walter and three others from our homes, without a warrant and without a reason. They began beating us until we arrived at the police barracks. There, they held us for three days, claiming we’d be charged with illicit association (agrupaciones ilícitas). We were beaten [repeatedly] during those three days.”  In 2014, when she was 20, Angelina N. fled abuse at the hands of Jaime M., the father of her 4-year-old daughter, and of Mateo O., a male gang member who harassed her repeatedly. US authorities apprehended her at the border trying to enter the US and deported her that same year. Once back in El Salvador, she was at home in October 2014, when Mateo resumed pursuing and threatening her. Angelina recounted: “[He] came inside and forced me to have sex with him for the first time. He took out his gun.… I was so scared that I obeyed … when he left, I started crying. I didn’t say anything at the time or even file a complaint to the police. I thought it would be worse if I did because I thought someone from the police would likely tell [Mateo].… He told me he was going to kill my father and my daughter if I reported the [original and three subsequent] rapes, because I was ‘his woman.’ [He] hit me and told me that he wanted me all to himself.”  As in these three cases, some people deported from the United States back to El Salvador face the same abusers, often in the same neighborhoods, they originally fled: gang members, police officers, state security forces, and perpetrators of domestic violence. Others worked in law enforcement in El Salvador and now fear persecution by gangs or corrupt officials.  Deportees also include former long-term US residents, who with their families are singled out as easy and lucrative targets for extortion or abuse. Former long-term residents of the US who are deported may also readily run afoul of the many unspoken rules Salvadorans must follow in their daily lives in order to avoid being harmed.  Nearly 900,000 Salvadorans living in the US without papers or only a temporary status together with the thousands leaving El Salvador each month to seek safety in the US are increasingly at risk of deportation. The threat of deportation is on the rise due to various Trump administration policy changes affecting US immigration enforcement inside its borders and beyond, changes that exacerbated the many hurdles that already existed for individuals seeking protection and relief from deportation.  Increasingly, the United States is pursuing policies that shift responsibility for immigration enforcement to countries like Mexico in an effort to avoid any obligation for the safety and well-being of migrants and protection of asylum-seekers. As ever-more restrictive asylum and immigration policies take hold in the US, this situation—for Salvadorans, and for others—will only worsen. Throughout, US authorities are turning a blind eye to the abuse Salvadorans face upon return.  Some people from El Salvador living in the United States have had a temporary legal status known as “Temporary Protected Status” or “TPS,” which has allowed those present in the United States since February 2001 (around 195,000 people) to build their lives in the country with limited fear of deportation. Similarly, in 2012, the Obama administration provided some 26,000 Salvadorans with “Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals” or “DACA” status, which afforded some who had arrived as children with a temporary legal status. The Trump administration had decided to end TPS in January 2020, but to comply with a court order extended work authorization to January 2021. It remains committed to ending DACA.  While challenges to both policies wend their way through the courts, people live in a precarious situation in which deportation may occur as soon as those court cases are resolved (at the time of writing the DACA issue was before the US Supreme Court; and the TPS work authorization extension to January 2021 could collapse if a federal appellate court decides to reverse an injunction on the earlier attempt to terminate TPS).  Salvadoran asylum seekers are also increasingly at risk of deportation and return. The Trump administration has pursued a series of policy initiatives aimed at making it harder for people fleeing their countries to seek asylum in the United States by separating children from their parents, limiting the number of people processed daily at official border crossings, prolonging administrative detention, imposing fees on the right to seek asylum, extending from 180 days to one year the bar on work authorization after filing an asylum claim, barring asylum for those who transited another country before entering the United States, requiring asylum seekers to await their hearings in Mexico, where many face dangers, and attempting to narrow asylum.  These changes aggravated pre-existing flaws in US implementation of its protection responsibilities and came as significant numbers of people sought protection outside of El Salvador. In the decade from 2009 to 2019, according to government data, Mexican and United States officials made at least 732,000 migration-related apprehensions of Salvadoran migrants crossing their territory (175,000 were made by Mexican authorities and just over 557,000 by US authorities).  According to the United Nations’ refugee agency, the number of Salvadorans expressing fear of being seriously harmed if returned to El Salvador has skyrocketed. Between 2012 and 2017, the number of Salvadoran annual asylum applicants in the US grew by nearly 1,000 percent, from about 5,600 to over 60,000. By 2018, Salvadorans had the largest number (101,000) of any nationality of pending asylum applications in the United States. At the same time, approximately 129,500 more Salvadorans had pending asylum applications in numerous other countries throughout the world. People are fleeing El Salvador in large numbers due to the violence and serious human rights abuses they face at home, including one of the highest murder rates in the world and very high rates of sexual violence and disappearance.  Despite clear prohibitions in international law on returning people to risk of persecution or torture, Salvadorans often cannot avoid deportation from the US. Unauthorized immigrants, those with temporary status, and asylum seekers all face long odds. They are subjected to deportation in a system that is harsh and punitive—plagued with court backlogs, lack of access to effective legal advice and assistance, prolonged and inhumane detention, and increasingly restrictive legal definitions of who merits protection. The US has enlisted Mexico—which has a protection system that its own human rights commission has called “broken”—to stop asylum seekers before they reach the US and host thousands returned to wait for their US proceedings to unfold. The result is that people who need protection may be returned to El Salvador and harmed, even killed.  Instead of deterring and deporting people, the US should focus on receiving those who cross its border with dignity and providing them a fair chance to explain why they need protection. Before deporting Salvadorans living in the United States, either with TPS or in some other immigration status, US authorities should take into account the extraordinary risks former long-term residents of the US may face if sent back to the country of their birth. The US should address due process failures in asylum adjudications and adopt a new legal and policy framework for protection that embraces the current global realities prompting people to flee their homes by providing “complementary protection” to anyone who faces real risk of serious harm.  As immediate and first steps, the United States government should adopt the following six recommendations to begin to address the problems identified in this report. Additional medium- and long-term legal and policy recommendations appear in the final section of this report.  The Trump administration should repeal the Migration Protection Protocols (MPP); the two Asylum Bans; and the Asylum Cooperation Agreements.  administration should repeal the Migration Protection Protocols (MPP); the two Asylum Bans; and the Asylum Cooperation Agreements. The Attorney General of the United States should reverse his decisions that restrict gender-based, gang-related, and family-based grounds for asylum.  Congress and the Executive Branch should ensure that US funding for Mexican migration enforcement activities does not erode the right to seek and receive asylum in Mexico.  Congress should immediately exercise its appropriation power by: 1) Refraining from providing additional funding to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) unless and until abusive policies and practices that separate families, employ unnecessary detention, violate due process rights, and violate the right to seek asylum are stopped; 2) Prohibiting the use of funds to implement the Migrant Protection Protocols, the “Asylum Bans,” or the Asylum Cooperation Agreements, or any subsequent revisions to those protocols and agreements that block access to the right to seek asylum in the United States.  Congress should exercise its oversight authority by requiring the Government Accountability Office and the Office of Inspector General to produce reports on the United States’ fulfilment of its asylum and protection responsibilities, including by collecting and releasing accurate data on the procedural experiences of asylum seekers (access to counsel, wait times, staff capacity to assess claims, humanitarian and protection resources available) and on harms experienced by people deported from the United States to their countries of origin.  Congress should enact, and the President should sign, legislation that would broadly protect individuals with Temporary Protected Status (including Salvadorans) and DACA recipients, such as the Dream and Promise Act of 2019, but without the overly broad restrictions based on juvenile conduct or information from flawed gang databases.  Glossary  The National Civilian Police (Policía Nacional Civil, PNC)  The PNC is the only governmental agency with offices in all 262 municipalities of El Salvador. It receives crime reports, but by law must refer them to the District Attorney’s office (Fiscalía General de la República, FGR), which officially classifies crimes. The PNC is the first to arrive at homicide scenes. At the center to which deportees arrive (the migrant return center), the PNC conducts one of two interviews deported adults must complete before being released.  The Salvadoran Attorney General’s Office (Fiscalía General de la República, FGR)  The Salvadoran Attorney General’s Office (FGR) has at least one District Attorney’s Office per department. This agency is responsible for bringing criminal charges and conducting criminal investigations. At homicide scenes, the FGR often enters with the police and always directs the investigation. Given the high incidence of crime in El Salvador, prosecutors and investigators have very large caseloads.  The Salvadoran Institute of Legal Medicine (Instituto de Medicina Legal, IML)  The Salvadoran Institute of Legal Medicine (IML) is the national forensic body tasked with conducting anthropological, biological, chemical, forensic, and pathological exams and autopsies at crime scenes and for criminal investigations. Every department has at least one IML office, and seven departments have a regional clinic, totaling 17 IML installations countrywide. Of the three governmental agencies that attend homicide scenes and crime victims, IML has the smallest staff and budget, despite some of the highest levels of education and training.  Local Office for Attention to Victims (Oficina Local de Atención a Víctimas, OLAV)  During the Sánchez Cerén administration, Plan El Salvador Seguro (adopted by the Salvadoran government to try to improve security conditions in the country) created 20 Local Offices for Attention to Victims (OLAV) in 10 departments to provide legal, psychological, and social attention to victims of crime, including those displaced by violence. One OLAV is located at the migrant return center. There, migration authorities are expected to screen returned migrants for protection needs in their intake interviews. Any adult who presents a protection need should then be referred to the OLAV.  Salvadoran Institute for the Holistic Development of Children and Adolescents (Instituto Salvadoreño para el Desarrollo Integral de la Niñez y la Adolescencia, ISNA)  ISNA is the Salvadoran governmental institution that develops and executes programming for children and adolescents. Their programming includes childcare and foster care, physical and psychological health and wellbeing services, job and vocational training, and education.  The Center for Attention to Children, Adolescents and Family Niñez, Adolescencia y Familia, CANAF)(Centro de Atención a la  Created in response to increased attention to child migration in El Salvador, the Center for Attention to Children, Adolescents and Family (CANAF) is a program overseen by ISNA primarily providing health and social services to returned child and youth migrants and their families. According to the Salvadoran newspaper La Prensa Gráfica, between January to July 2019, 4,150 children were returned to El Salvador from Guatemala, Mexico, and the United States, and CANAF had contact with at least 2,000 of these children through its staff at the migrant return center and four offices in San Vicente, Usulután, San Miguel and Santa Ana departments. Staff at departmental offices reported caseloads no greater than 300 since opening their doors, in part because so many children migrated again.  El Salvador’s General Directorate for Migration and Foreigners (Dirección General de Migración y Extranjería, DGME)  The General Directorate for Migration and Foreigners (DGME) is the Salvadoran government agency responsible for overseeing migration matters. This includes services ranging from the issuance of passports and visas to immigration enforcement.  Directorate for Attention to the Migrant (Dirección de Atención al Migrante, DAMI)  Also called the “Center for Holistic Attention to the Migrant (CAIM),” “Migrant Return Center,” and “Return Center,” the Directorate for Attention to the Migrant (DAMI) is the DGME-run center in the Quiñonez neighborhood (also called “La Chacra”) of San Salvador where people deported from US federal immigration detention are processed back into El Salvador. As of 2018, up to three flights from the US arrive to El Salvador’s International Airport each week, with as many as 135 people on each flight who are taken by bus to DAMI for two interviews. In the first interview, DGME officials ask deportees basic questions about their destination, family, and plans. At the second, PNC agents ask about where the person plans to live, run the deported person’s name in the Salvadoran criminal database, and photograph tattoos and scars. Agents conduct additional questions based upon information received in advance about certain people marked as gang members by US law enforcement agencies or with criminal records in the US. The responses are stored in Salvadoran police databases and shared the same day with local PNC’s where deportees say they will reside.  Yo Cambio (“I Change”)  Officially, Yo Cambio is a government-sponsored program and prison management model administered by El Salvador’s General Directorate of Prison Centers (Dirección General de Centros Penales) that works with former gang members and incarcerated persons on their rehabilitation and reintegration into society. According to El Salvador’s government, Yo Cambio began in 2011 as a treatment project in a sector of the Apanteos Prison in Santa Ana Department. In 2014, Yo Cambio was launched from a program to a prison management model used across El Salvador, but as of 2016, it had hardly any budget. As of February 2018, Yo Cambio has been replicated in 14 prisons. Demand is high, but lack of budget continues to be an issue. Two deportees interviewed for this report who had never been charged with a crime in El Salvador carried with them a Yo Cambio certificate to verify for police who harassed them that they had no criminal record.  Particularly / Chronically Violent Neighborhood  Human Rights Watch will call “particularly” or “chronically” violent those neighborhoods that are typically densely populated and low-resourced and which consistently (year-in and year-out) register higher numbers of homicide, sexual crime, and other crime than nearly all others in a municipality. Gang presence is strong in these neighborhoods. As a result, authorities and society view them and their residents as particularly dangerous, creating stigma impossible to escape, even if a resident from one of these neighborhoods moves to a new neighborhood. State actors, so-called death squads or extermination groups and private actors have also committed abuses in these neighborhoods.  Methodology  This report is based on research conducted by Human Rights Watch in El Salvador, Mexico, and the United States between November 2018 and December 2019. Human Rights Watch conducted multiple-session interviews with more than 50 directly impacted individuals, including 11 female and 22 male deportees; the surviving relatives or friends of two women (one who was transgender) and 16 men killed after their deportations; and the surviving relatives of two women killed following their husbands’ return to El Salvador after long-term residence in the US. In a few cases, our researchers had previously spoken with the same interviewees in 2014.  In El Salvador, we interviewed 41 officials in nine departments at local district attorney’s offices (FGR), forensic units (IML), and police agencies (PNC) who work at homicide scenes and participate in both crime investigations and hearings, and 31 additional authorities at the migration agency (DGME), local child migrant protection offices (CANAF), the armed forces of El Salvador, criminal sentencing courts, and victim’s assistance offices (OLAV) in all 14 departments, as well as researchers, journalists, and non-profit service providers. In the United States, we interviewed approximately 30 immigration attorneys, three defense attorneys, and several social workers, trauma-informed healthcare workers, and researchers in nine states and the District of Columbia. These interviewees identified deportees who suffered harm. They also discussed other cases known to them, professionally or personally, of individuals and families harmed following deportation.  In the United States, we went to the individuals and families those in El Salvador and the US referred to us, visiting the three most common counties of residence of Salvadorans in the US and others in nine states and the District of Columbia. We also contacted reporters, immigration attorneys, social service providers, and organizers and asked them to further reach out to their colleagues and networks about persons who had either been recently deported or harmed after deportation.  Included in this report are cases of people who experienced post-deportation harm between 2013 and 2019. In the majority of these cases, the harm occurred within a year of deportation, often in the same month of deportation. In order to assess harms that escalate over time or which for other reasons do not occur immediately (for instance, because a deportee successfully hides from potential abusers for a period), our analysis also includes cases in which the post-deportation harm started within five years of deportation. For deportees killed, we have detailed the time elapsed between deportations and deaths in section II. Likewise, we focused this report on harms suffered after deportation from the US, as opposed to Mexico or other countries.  We spoke with fewer women than men who had been deported, primarily because they constitute a smaller proportion of deportees. According to statistics obtained through a public information request with El Salvador’s General Directorate for Migration and Foreigners (DGME), women constituted between 7.7 and 17.1 percent of all individuals deported from the United States annually from 2012 to 2017. We chose to conduct our interviews with children with their parents present and therefore could have missed important components of their experiences related to their parents or household, such as domestic violence or neglect.  Human Rights Watch carried out interviews in Spanish or in English, without interpreters, depending on the preference of the interviewee(s). We conducted a handful of interviews in the US and two interviews in El Salvador by voice or video call. We conducted all other interviews in person. Human Rights Watch informed all interviewees of the purpose of the interview, its voluntary nature, and the ways in which the information would be collected and used. Interviewers assured participants that they could end the interview at any time or decline to answer any questions, without negative consequences. All interviewees provided verbal informed consent to participate. When appropriate, Human Rights Watch provided contact information for organizations offering counseling, health, legal, or other social services.  Initial interview sessions with deportees, their family, or friends lasted between one and four hours and were intentionally unstructured so that the interviewee could elect what they shared. Subsequent sessions were shorter and more structured. In El Salvador and Mexico, sessions most often took place in a private part of the preferred restaurant closest to an interviewee’s home, although a few sessions took place at the person’s home, workplace, or by phone or social media (principally Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp). In the US, interviews most often took place in the person’s home but also occurred in a detention center, at an office, and by phone.  Human Rights Watch did not provide interviewees with compensation for participating but did in some cases provide a meal and transportation costs. Interviews with other types of sources lasted between half-an-hour and two hours, with almost all occurring in work offices or over the phone, although a few with persons previously known to Human Rights Watch took place over a meal or while in transit together.  Human Rights Watch took extreme care to minimize the risk that recounting experiences could further traumatize those interviewed. Besides letting interviewees determine the first session’s structure and building rapport over multiple sessions, we also fact-checked aspects of each individual’s account before meeting with them again.  The names of all persons interviewed, including officials, have been replaced with pseudonyms to mitigate security concerns or retaliation. In particularly sensitive cases, like those involving state perpetrators of harm or interviewees in the process of fleeing or seeking asylum, we have also deliberately withheld details about the date or location of abuses and our interviews. Although we analyzed the neighborhoods in which particular deportees were harmed, deportees’ pseudonyms are intentionally disassociated from them to further ensure anonymity.  In addition to interviews, we used four techniques to identify possible cases of harm experienced by deported people, to fact-check individual accounts obtained through interviews, and to deepen our contextual knowledge of the neighborhoods and circumstances surrounding deportees’ daily lives in El Salvador:  First, we compiled data from the three Salvadoran agencies that maintain registries on disappearances, sexual crimes and violent deaths. Through public information requests to the Salvadoran Attorney General’s Access to Public Information Office, we acquired municipal-level data on adult and child homicides and sexual crimes and arrests, hearings and convictions for these crimes. The supplied data was aggregated annually for the years 2013 to 2018. We also monitored the national Salvadoran attorney general’s Twitter page and compiled a database of public reports of child disappearances.  Second, we systematically searched the Salvadoran printed press (in Spanish) for the neighborhood names (including various spelling variations, when necessary) where those interviewed lived or fled, yielding over 22,000 articles that formed the basis of analysis. The relevant results were skimmed, and we then read and analyzed relevant articles describing violence or other aspects of neighborhood life relevant to deportees’ (and other residents’) experiences. These data have extreme limitations. However, they did allow us to identify themes in neighborhood dynamics, including incidents of violence, stories evidencing economic hardship in these neighborhoods, crimes committed, victims, victimizers, and state actions. Having these additional data facilitated chronological questioning during subsequent interview sessions.  Third, we searched the words “ deportada/o ” in digitized decisions of El Salvador's 24 criminal sentencing tribunals. Among the 260 resulting criminal sentencing tribunal decisions, we found 18 decisions that documented harm to persons deported from the United States in eight Salvadoran departments, but only seven documented harm experienced in 2013 or more recently. We obtained one more 2018 decision by requesting it from the tribunal in person.  ” in digitized decisions of El Salvador's 24 criminal sentencing tribunals. Among the 260 resulting criminal sentencing tribunal decisions, we found 18 decisions that documented harm to persons deported from the United States in eight Salvadoran departments, but only seven documented harm experienced in 2013 or more recently. We obtained one more 2018 decision by requesting it from the tribunal in person. Fourth, we searched the words “deportada/o” in 14 Salvadoran news outlets (all in Spanish). Among the 3,767 articles that returned, we found 288 appearing in 13 Salvadoran outlets and five international or US outlets reporting on abuse of deportees. Among these, we identified 219 articles describing the killings of 106 persons deported from the United States. The deaths occurred between January 2013 and September 2019 in all 14 Salvadoran departments.  When describing our findings from these various sources we used the term “identified” for cases found only through press searches; and the terms “investigated” or “documented” for cases we found through interviews with directly impacted individuals cross-checked with other sources such as criminal tribunal decisions, press accounts, or interviews with officials.  Finally, Human Rights Watch compiled data from El Salvador’s General Directorate for Migration and Foreigners (DGME) on deportations. Through public information requests to DGME’s Access to Public Information Office, we acquired data on deportations from 2012 to 2017 for all countries, and for only Mexico and the United States for 2018, according to municipality of birth and residence for children and adults. However, these data contain no information about the experiences of deportees after their return to El Salvador. No governmental or nongovernmental organizations, domestic or international, monitor what happens to deported Salvadorans, including their criminal victimization or other alleged harm suffered. This makes it impossible to obtain a complete or representative sample of cases of deportees harmed after return to El Salvador.  I. Background  Human Rights Situation in El Salvador  El Salvador, with just over six million citizens, has among the world’s highest homicide rates, alongside thousands of missing-persons cases and sexual crimes since 2013, according to data from the Salvadoran Attorney General’s Access to Public Information Office. State authorities have historically been largely ineffective in protecting the population from this violence, which is often perpetrated by gangs.  At the same time, Salvadoran security forces have themselves committed extrajudicial executions, sexual assaults, enforced disappearances, and torture. Impunity is widespread. For example, investigations reached hearings in only 14 of 48 cases involving 116 extrajudicial killings committed from 2014 to 2018 that the Salvadoran Ombudsperson for the Defense of Human Rights (PDDH) examined. Two resulted in convictions. Successive Salvadoran governments have deployed military units alongside police in public security operations, despite a 1992 peace accord stipulation against it. Media outlets widely report that the current national police director is under investigation for threats and links to drug trafficking and extermination groups.  In 2019 alone, the Central American University Human Rights Institute received seven reports of elite Salvadoran police units burning victims. For example, in March 2019, Tactical Operation Section agents beat, strangled, blindfolded, and handcuffed a 20-year-old man in a sugarcane field in Apopa municipality whom they suspected of gang membership or hiding weapons or drugs, and set fire to the field where they left him unconscious. He emerged from the fire with burns to his face and feet. Victims or witnesses of eight arbitrary arrests in two incidents in 2019 and late 2018 told Human Rights Watch of beatings at police barracks.  In August 2019, the Lethal Force Monitor reported that Salvadoran police and soldiers killed 1,626 people from 2011 through 2017, including 48 boys, four women, and 355 men in 2017. Authorities recorded every year more than 92 percent of victims as gang members and nearly all incidents as “confrontations” or “shootouts.” However, also in August 2019, the PDDH reported that it had examined killings of 28 boys, seven women, and 81 men and found few resulted from confrontations.  As of October 2019, the country’s jails, juvenile and youth facilities, and adult prisons held 45,439 people in custody, more than twice the official capacity, according to the online database World Prison Brief. The IML registered 14 homicides in police barracks and prisons in 2018. One official told Human Rights Watch that 10 other detainees had died from extreme heat. Two inmates said there was tuberculosis in Salvadoran prisons. One of these same inmates along with another inmate told Human Rights Watch that officials provided them inadequate food, hygiene products, and medicine and, in what appeared to be instances of excessive use of force, beat them and used pepper spray during prison searches.  Gangs  Gangs in El Salvador effectively exercise territorial control over specific neighborhoods and extort residents throughout the country. They forcibly recruit children. They sexually assault people targeted on the basis of their gender and/or real or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity. Gangs kill, abduct, rape, or displace those who resist. Many of those who are abducted are later found dead or never heard from again. According to unverified estimates cited by the UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, approximately 60,000 gang members reportedly operate in some 247 out of 262 municipalities in the country. Gangs enforce their territories’ borders and extort and surveil residents and those transiting, particularly around public transport, schools, and markets. Allegations of security and elected officials collaborating with gangs in criminal operations have been reported by the press and all political parties have negotiated with gangs according to consistent allegations reported, but not substantiated by, the UN special rapporteur.  Disappearances, Abductions, and Missing Persons  The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) reported in December 2019 that the FGR registered 3,289 people who “disappeared” in 2018 and 3,030 in 2019. According to the IACHR, victims said they are at times unable to file complaints regarding family members who have gone missing, and that they usually face delays in the investigations, including failure to respond in the critical first hours after a disappearance.  Between 2010 and August 2019, the police have registered over 10,800 victims who have gone missing—more than the estimated 8,000 to 10,000 disappeared during the civil war (1979-1992), according to press accounts. Because very few cases are investigated, knowledge of perpetrators is limited. These figures likely include suspected abductions by criminal gangs or state authorities and other cases in which people have gone missing in unexplained circumstances.  Harassment and Violence Against Women and LGBT Individuals  A 2017 national survey found that 67 percent of women in El Salvador faced violence at some point in their lives, and the rates of “feminicide,” including domestic violence killings are the highest in the region. Despite some reform efforts, such as specialized women’s courts and dedicated units in the Attorney General’s Office, formidable obstacles remain for women seeking police protection, investigation, or justice through the courts.  Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people who are deported from the United States to El Salvador are likely to face specific threats. Human Rights Watch research has found that LGBT people in El Salvador are often rejected by their families, meaning that many would have no family support during the process of reintegration. Human Rights Watch repeatedly heard from LGBT Salvadorans, both in El Salvador and in the United States, that gangs had targeted them on the basis of their sexual orientation or gender identity, subjecting some LGBT people to sexual violence and extorting others due to their perceived vulnerability. Several LGBT Salvadorans also reported being beaten or sexually assaulted by the police. In January 2019, Camila Díaz Cordova, a transgender woman deported from the United States, was beaten to death. In July, the FGR charged three police officers with her kidnapping and aggravated homicide. The case remained open at the time of writing. Within the span of one month in late 2019, three transgender women and one gay man were murdered in El Salvador in circumstances that led activists to suspect they were hate crimes.  US Laws Affecting Salvadoran Asylum Seekers, Refugees, and Other Migrants  Salvadoran nationals who are neither citizens of the United States nor undocumented hold one of several legal statuses, none of which protects them completely from deportation. These various statuses, and the degree to which the US laws affording them comport with international human rights and refugee law are discussed in greater detail in Section VI.  According to 2017 US Census data analyzed by the Migration Policy Institute, about 1.2 million non-citizens whose country of birth was El Salvador live in the United States. They in turn fall in four main legal categories.  - First, about 665,000 Salvadorans are living in the United States in an unauthorized legal status, meaning at any moment they could be arrested and deported from the country. During their deportation proceedings, they technically would have the ability to raise their fears of persecution or torture as a defense against removal. In reality, this is extremely difficult to do successfully.  - Second, about 340,000 Salvadorans live in the United States as lawful permanent residents. These people have permission to work and build their lives in the United States, but if they are convicted of any of a long list of crimes (including non-violent drug or driving offenses generally considered as misdemeanors), they are subject to deportation under procedures that severely restrict the possibility of raising their fears of persecution upon return as a defense against removal. They might be able to raise fear of torture in El Salvador, but in reality, the torture standard is more difficult to meet than the “fear of persecution” standard.  - Third, another 195,000 Salvadorans have temporary protection against deportation as recipients of Temporary Protected Status (TPS), a program that the US Congress put in place for Salvadorans since two devastating earthquakes hit the country in 2001. The Trump administration decided to end TPS in September 2019, but a court injunction has prevented termination from going into effect. Consequently, the Trump administration extended work authorization associated with TPS until January 2021, without extending TPS beyond January 2020. If appellate courts lift the injunction, Salvadorans who have been protected by TPS will be subject to removal. Due to lack of resources, legal advice, fear, or other reasons, some Salvadorans have not re-registered their TPS status, which moves them into an unauthorized status. During their deportation proceedings, former TPS holders technically would have the ability to raise their fears of persecution or other types of harm as a defense to removal; but in reality, this is very challenging to do successfully.  - Fourth, some 25,600 Salvadorans have been living in the US with temporary permission to remain in two-year increments under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which began in 2012, but which the Trump administration decided to end in September 2017. DACA status has been maintained by temporary court rulings but the Trump administration’s decision to end the program is being reviewed by the Supreme Court at this writing, making DACA recipients legitimately fearful of deportation. Due to lack of resources, legal advice, fear, or other reasons, some Salvadorans have not re-registered their DACA status, which moves them into an unauthorized status. During their deportation proceedings, former DACA holders technically would have the ability to raise their fears of persecution or other types of harm as a defense to removal; in reality, this is difficult to do successfully.  II. Deportees Killed  In researching this report, Human Rights Watch identified or investigated 138 cases of people killed between 2013 and 2019 after being deported from the United States. El Salvador’s high homicide rates (alongside many other types of harm), and the fact that these cases have been reported publicly over time, has put the United States government and its immigration officials on notice. On a daily basis, US immigration officials and judges nevertheless turn a blind eye to the reality that people deported by the United States to El Salvador have lost their lives, often at the hands of their original persecutors or people they legitimately feared would harm them in the future. In several of the cases we investigated for this report, such targeting was evident.  In other cases, the US government is returning people to a country with such significant levels of violence that there is a real risk that deportees will face a serious threat to their lives or physical integrity. Because current US asylum law does not provide “complementary protection” that would protect people facing such serious threats of violence, Human Rights Watch calls on the US Congress to adopt such a standard (discussed further in Section VII below). Even without such a standard, Salvadorans subject to deportation should have a meaningful opportunity to describe the risks they would face upon return and have that information considered before they are returned to El Salvador. The deaths described in this section, moreover, represent the tip of the iceberg—as detailed in subsequent sections, people deported to El Salvador encounter a wide range of human rights abuses that fall short of death.  Deported Former or Current Gang Members Killed by Gangs  According to Salvadoran authorities, the deportees at the highest risk of harm are alleged former and current gang members and those with alleged links to gangs. These alleged former and current gang members are sometimes killed by their own or rival gangs (they are also killed by state actors or death squads, as discussed below). An individual deportee’s reported status as a gang member by the press, by the police, or by other observers, may or may not be true.  Accounts of killings of deportees by gangs in court filings and press accounts indicate that a deportee might be killed by his own gang for not “re-activating” with the gang once in El Salvador, battling for power within the gang, committing crimes like robbery, or calling attention to the gang through flamboyant behavior. Gangs reportedly kill members of rival gangs, or those assumed to be members, for living in or transiting their area, including one who was evangelizing after leaving behind gang life and one who was recently deported.  Deported Former or Current Gang Members Killed by State Actors  State actors, such as police or other law enforcement, reportedly have killed deportees alleged to be former or current gang members, according to relatives, journalists, and academics who spoke with Human Rights Watch. Through interviews with directly affected persons and witnesses, we learned of several such cases. For example:  Enrico X. told Human Rights Watch in 2019 his cousin, Luis Y., a former member of a gang then called B-18, tried to leave the gang by fleeing to the United States, but after he was deported from the US in either 2016 or 2017, Enrico said that the police in El Salvador killed Luis. Enrico told us:  After he was deported back to El Salvador, one day he [Luis] was eating breakfast and the police came to the house and shot him in the head and killed him. The police officer said: “I told you I was going to kill you eventually,” and put a gun to his head and shot him right there on the spot in front of the neighbor woman who used to cook his meals for him. Some of the other neighbors also witnessed this shooting.  Enrico told Human Rights Watch that police in 2018 shot another young deportee from the United States in front of his home. “He was known to be deported from the US.” An affidavit filed by Enrico in his asylum and withholding case gave further details:  I don’t know the young man’s real name, but everyone in town called him ‘Roberto M.’.… I heard a shot and a noise.… I ducked down low, and I saw two police officers run towards [him], who was down on the ground in front of my property in the street. Roberto had been going by on a bicycle when he was shot. The two police officers picked him up and took him away with them. I saw them take [him] into a sugar cane field. A police motorcycle drove up around the same time this was all happening. I did not see where they took [him] after they went into the field. I was very scared and I quickly went in my house and closed the door. Not long after this, a police officer came and banged on my door, yelling at me to come outside. I went outside and he immediately put a gun to my head and said, ‘I know you saw.’ I recognized this officer by his face. I had seen him patrol my street many times in the past with other rural police officers.… The officer was very aggressive with me, asking me who else was home with me.… The officer told me that Roberto was a B-18 gang member and that if I said anything about what I saw, the same will happen to me or worse.… Every day after [that], the same rural police officers started to come to the house and bang on my door.… They would bang on my door and yell profanities at me, demanding I come out.  Our research indicates that Salvadoran officials often assume that individuals deported from the US are both active gang members and were convicted of violent crimes while in the US. They also may choose to target specific deportees based on information shared by the United States via INTERPOL. Three departmental police delegations told Human Rights Watch they receive lists of deportees alleged to be gang members and share those lists throughout the department, including with neighborhood-level posts where deportees indicate they will live. One ranking police officer explained to Human Rights Watch: “ICE communicates with INTERPOL in advance of deportation flights, and lists of persons with a capture order [an INTERPOL Red Notice] or guilty of a crime are sent to us in the departmental offices, [even though] most on this list are captured in the airport.” The police then visit the locations provided. This officer said, “We think that if a person wasn’t wanted in the United States, it must be because the deported person is bad.”  Police scrutiny of such individuals may be a legitimate activity in furtherance of public safety. At the same time, even if an individual is an active gang member or has served a sentence for a violent crime in the US and is suspected of further criminal activity in El Salvador, unlawful use of force by law enforcement is never justified. Security officials involvement in extrajudicial executions and excessive use of force is often linked to government efforts to combat gangs, as reported by the UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial killings in her 2018 report on El Salvador, as well as the Legal Force Monitor and the Salvadoran Ombudsperson for the Defense of Human Rights in 2019.  Deportees Killed Without Apparent Gang-Involvement  In some cases, the deportee victims had no apparent involvement with gangs, but nevertheless were killed in circumstances suggesting the killers were gang members. For example, several of the below cases identified through press accounts reference failure to pay extortion demands and non-gang-related tattoos as possible motives for the killings.  Carlos Alberto Garay, 43, was killed while driving his pick-up truck in Usulután. A press account reported that he was intercepted by two men, who shot him several times and then fled on foot, according to police sources. Garay’s neighbors told reporters he had been deported several months earlier from the United States, and they knew he was being extorted by gangs and that his family had been threatened. The press account did not describe Garay as gang-involved.  Mario Enrique Sandoval Gómez, around 30 years old, was shot dead in his home on June 29, 2017 by two people who convinced him to open the door by pretending they were police officers. According to press accounts, Sandoval Gómez was not suspected of gang affiliation and the “tattoos on his body were not related to gangs.” Sandoval Gómez reportedly had been deported from the United States two years prior to the incident. His wife, who was at home on the night of the murder, had applied for him to return to the US, where the couple planned to join her parents already living there.  Tommy Eduardo Paiz, 41, who worked in a call center in El Salvador, had been deported from the United States about one year prior to his death. A relative interviewed by the press said of Paiz, “he came here and started working.” On August 4, 2018, he was on his way to visit his partner and 6-month-old son when his car broke down in the department of La Libertad. Paiz had called a family member that same day to ask that they “let her know that I'm going to get home to see my little one."" Paiz had several “artistic tattoos” on his body. Police reports indicated he was approached by attackers, hit with a blunt object on the head and shot several times in the head and abdomen. When found, he was handcuffed. The press account did not describe Paiz as gang-involved.  While press accounts did not speculate on whether the victims faced harm from their killers previously, some interviewees specified that the same gang members who targeted individuals before they fled El Salvador were responsible for killing these individuals after deportation. For example, José Miguel C., told us about his nephew, Joaquín, who he did not believe to be gang-involved, and who had fled gang threats to the US, but was deported in 2017 and killed by alleged gang members that same year. He said: “[Joaquín] always said they [MS members] would try to kill him again. They did [kill him] on [Salvadoran] Father’s Day…. The same members who killed him had threatened him beforehand.”  Similarly, a policeman told us about Nicolas P., 25, who was the victim of an attempted homicide by gang members in 2015. The same year, he migrated to the US, only to be deported in 2017. According to a police report, the policeman said, “on the day Nicolas returned to El Salvador, he arrived at his family home…. At 9:30 p.m., he was at home, the gang members arrived and shot him dead.”  Deported Former Police Officers Killed by Gangs  Human Rights Watch interviewed two families who had multiple members working for the Salvadoran military or police who were threatened, then fled to the United States hoping to seek asylum but were subsequently deported and killed.  Adriana J. worked for the Salvadoran police. After being threatened by gangs, she fled El Salvador for the United States, but according to her cousin Irene J., Adriana was detained by US authorities and did not get to apply for asylum presumably because she was rejected after her credible fear interview in the expedited removal screening. Irene believes that Adriana was still in detention in the US in 2015 and deported that year or later to El Salvador. Her death certificate indicates she died in El Salvador from gunshot wounds to her abdomen and skull in 2017. Irene learned from her mother, who lived nearby, that when she went to the cordoned crime scene and spoke with police officers, the officers told her, “The gang members killed her. Three bullets.”  According to press accounts, Mauricio de Jesús Amaya had been a municipal police officer in El Salvador for 14 years. In 2017, his sister, Gloria, was shot dead as they rode together on a motorcycle in the El Vado neighborhood of Nueva Concepción municipality of Chalatenango department. Mauricio believes he was the actual target. Twenty days later, he and his family, including his brother, Santos Amaya, who also worked with the municipal police, fled El Salvador and arrived in the US approximately 10 days later. Santos, who had received death threats from gang members who had been deliberately targeting police in the municipality where the family lived, was deported from the US in April 2018, and was killed that same month.  Jacinto K. Human Rights Watch interviewed Jacinto K. and first interviewed his then 15-year-old son, Óscar K., in El Salvador in April 2014. In December 2011, Jacinto and his wife had been ordered removed from the United States. In order to avoid permanent bars in US law on returning to the country, they chose to depart “voluntarily.” Jacinto and his wife had to borrow money to pay for the family’s plane tickets (they had three children, Óscar, age 15 in 2014, and a younger daughter and US citizen son). Jacinto told us that upon the family’s return to El Salvador: “I thought starting a small business in [a rural area of El Salvador’s Central Region] was our best bet for paying the loan back quickly. Unfortunately, MS began charging me renta shortly after I opened it. I haven’t been able to pay down the loan, am barely supporting my family, and worry that I won’t be able to keep paying renta.” At the time of our interview Jacinto discounted the power of MS in the area, telling us he felt relatively safe. However, two weeks after our interview, Jacinto was shot dead in broad daylight in a public space of their town. Prior to his dad’s death, when a Human Rights Watch researcher sat down to interview Óscar K. he said, “We can speak in English. I’ve missed it.” He said he wanted to return to the Midwestern United States, where he lived from 2003 to 2011, to finish high school. Óscar said he had just completed 9th grade in his Salvadoran neighborhood public school. Besides the classes not being challenging, he told us, “I do not feel safe. I only leave the house to go to and from school. Still, to get there, I have to walk past the neighborhood’s Mara Salvatrucha gang. They shout insults at me and threaten to kill me if I do not join them.” After his father was killed, Óscar separated from his mother and siblings, and they each went to a different part of the country in search of safety. According to our subsequent contacts with Óscar, the gang has found them each in their new locations within the country, and at the time of writing Óscar and his mother and siblings had each moved at least one other time.  Data on Deportees Killed  For this report, we identified or investigated 138 cases of people killed after their deportations from the United States between 2013 and 2019. Most of these people died between a few days and two years after their return to El Salvador. Of 106 cases reported in 219 articles by the Salvadoran press, 81 deportees died after being in the country for one year or less, with 15 additional deportees killed after 13 months to two years in the country. Fourteen deportees were killed less than a week after their return, with three dying in their first 24 hours in El Salvador.  We eliminated many cases of deportees reportedly killed between 2013 and 2019 from our final count because they died more than five years after their deportations or after an unknown period from their deportations. For all deported people killed, we focused only on individuals deported from the United States. In addition, of all 138 cases included, the earliest year of deportation was 2010 (this was the year of deportation for one person killed in 2013, for one killed in 2014, and for two people killed in 2015).  In addition to the cases identified through the press, we documented five cases of deportees killed between 2013 and 2019 by reviewing court documents for Salvadoran criminal sentencing tribunals. For 14 cases in the same time frame, we learned of the killing of deportees through interviews with the victim’s family members. We documented 23 cases in interviews with authorities. In all of these cases, we sought corroboration of the killing and circumstances of the individual deportee’s case with other sources. The below graphic illustrates the corroboration we were able to obtain.  Among the 219 press reports on killings of 106 deportees, Human Rights Watch found cases of six deportees killed between 2013 to 2019 that named state authorities or indicated death squads as the alleged killers. The Rural Police were the suspected killers in two cases in an isolated rural area where gang members or authorities had previously prevented press from entering (and where police had been documented to have committed extrajudicial killings starting in 2013). Private actors were the alleged perpetrators in the overwhelming majority of the killings. Only three accounts identified through our press searches–in which one to three others were killed at the same time–left open the possibility that the deported man was not the target of the lethal attack.  Killing of Deportees Likely Undercounted  Homicide data are regularly reported by police authorities in El Salvador. However, we believe our count of 138 persons killed after deportation from the US to El Salvador between 2013-2019 represents a significant undercount for two main reasons. First, the specific victimization of deportees often goes unrecorded in forensic, media, or governmental accounts. Among victims who do report, protocol does not require authorities to ask about migration status of victims.  All homicide journalists interviewed for this report said they mostly rely on police sources to determine if a victim was deported from the United States. Police acknowledged to Human Rights Watch that they do not always consult the relevant database to get a victim’s migration status. In fact, they told Human Rights Watch that they only do so when the victim had no documents or had tattoos. Reports on the killings of 53 deported men included police telling the press the victim had no identity documents or was a gang member; was linked to gangs, a thief, a drug user, or some other type of criminal (including 13 of those with tattoos).  There is no mandatory requirement that the Salvadoran prosecutor’s office (FGR) collects migratory status in its investigations, including in its homicide investigations. One prosecutor explained his office’s reasoning to Human Rights Watch: “We see crimes and do not give importance to this [migratory status]. It is not relevant.” An investigator in a different department also said migratory status was irrelevant to their office, “unless the person requests it.” Salvadoran authorities told us that too much stigma exists around deportation for victims or their family members to acknowledge it on their own. For example, a police chief told Human Rights Watch: “The deportee is stigmatized.” Likewise, a forensic doctor told us that none of the persons harmed after their deportation, or their surviving loved ones in cases of disappearance or killings, initially wanted to mention the victim’s status as a deportee because, “They do not always identify themselves…. Many times, I think it’s because of stigma, that they would feel pain to say it.”  In addition, Human Rights Watch documented three cases from 2013 to 2018 that illustrate how a victim’s identity as a deportee may go unreported unless they possess a stigmatized characteristic, such as having tattoos, being a gang member, or being a male between the ages of 15 and 39. The press did not mention in any of these three cases that the victim had been deported from the United States. None of the three had tattoos, and two were middle-aged men, perhaps explaining why the police did not check on their status in relevant databases or through other means.  The second reason we believe the 138 cases of killings to be an undercount is that certain categories of homicide cases, regardless of whether the person is a deportee or not, are much more likely to be undercounted, including cases involving (1) female victims, (2) people with identity documents (because they are less likely to be identified as deportees), (3) people without tattoos, (4) people killed in areas where crimes are more likely to go unreported including particularly violent neighborhoods, isolated rural areas, and areas where gangs or authorities do not permit journalists to enter, (5) LGBT victims, and (6) people killed in the custody of Salvadoran authorities.  Police, other Salvadoran officials, and reporters have apparently also failed to determine the migration status of female homicide victims. We could not find a single press report on the killing of any cisgender (non-transgender) female deportees—even for a case of a former female police agent whom we documented through our interview with her surviving relatives, who was killed after her deportation from the United States. Nevertheless, several directly impacted individuals and authorities told us about women killed after their deportations. For example, one forensic official recalled multiple females killed after their deportations, just in the one department where he works:  Yes, there are women among these [who were deported and killed] …. Always by the gang, for the same phenomenon they’d left fleeing. She became their subject and could not free herself. If she gets with another [man], even [one] in the [same] gang, she is killed. Even if he’s in prison, both [she and he] could be killed.  III. Other Harms Faced by Deportees  In our research for this report we heard many gut-wrenching accounts from people subjected to terrible abuse after their deportations from the United States. Often, these were the same abuses from the same abusers that deportees had tried to escape by fleeing to the United States–only to be returned directly back to the violence they originally feared. The cycle of abuse and flight is chronic, and for many deportees feels inescapable. Given the horrors they had endured, it was not surprising to us that these people often tried to flee again.  Even more so than the numbers of killings of deportees, instances in which deportees were attacked by gangs or others, disappeared, forced into hiding, sexually assaulted, and tortured certainly exceed what we have been able to document. Many non-homicide crimes are unreported and thus undocumented in El Salvador. For example, one survey suggests that less than five percent of sexual crimes were reported to Salvadoran authorities in 2018. Crimes less serious than homicide go unreported to authorities, are infrequently investigated and prosecuted; and partly as a result of the lack of public accountability for these categories of crimes, they go unreported in the Salvadoran press. As discussed in the previous section, the victimization of deportees in particular goes almost completely undocumented in the country, due in part to the lack of any requirement that law enforcement authorities obtain the migration status of victims and also because victims and their family members often fail to report the victim’s status as a deportee.  Disappearances  Press reporting on individual cases of disappearances in El Salvador is rare. If a victim is killed, their body may never be found, and if a victim is alive, their whereabouts may not be known. When a victim’s body is found, often too much time has passed for the Salvadoran press to take interest. A common security practice among Salvadoran reporters is not reporting on their own neighborhoods. Not surprisingly then, two journalists each told us about a case of a disappeared deportee they had not reported in 2018, one because the incident happened in his neighborhood and one because he had other incidents to report on the same day that interested his editors more.  Still, we were able to identify 18 separate incidents (between 2013 and 2019, for which the disappearance happened within five years or less of the deportation) involving disappearances of deportees from the United States: at least one woman and four men, alongside 13 men who disappeared or were kidnapped before being found killed.  In a separate case, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (CIDH) issued precautionary measures (measures the commission adopts after reviewing evidence indicating imminent risk of irreparable harm to an individual) to an 18-year-old man deported from the US in September 2017 who was taken from his home in January 2018 by “some youth [muchachos],” and has not been seen since.  We also spoke with an IML investigator who said that he knew of “people deported who did disappear,” and a second IML investigator who agreed with this statement during the same interview.  Sexual Crimes  The United States Department of State (USDOS) Human Rights Reports on El Salvador from 2013 to 2018 stated that “rape and other sexual crimes against women were widespread.” Even so, news reporting on sexual crimes in El Salvador is rare, and as noted above, we believe widely under-reported by victims to authorities.  We documented four cases of sexual crimes and harassment against people deported from the United States (in three of these cases we know the victimization occurred between 2013 and 2019 and was within five years or less of the deportation. For one of the cases, our source was unwilling to provide any dates for security reasons). A male deportee died after castration, according to a criminal sentencing tribunal decision. In addition, according to a local prosecutor we interviewed, a woman was subjected to sexual harassment after her deportation from the US. Two additional cases include a woman deportee who told us that she was physically assaulted by a person linked to her former intimate partner, and after years of previous emotional, physical, and sexual abuse that prompted her original flight from the country; and a female deportee who said that she was raped by a gang member after deportation from the US.  Angelina N. In 2014, when she was 20 years old, Angelina N. fled abuse at the hands of Jaime M., the father of her 4-year-old daughter, who regularly beat her. Jaime falsely accused her of having an affair with Mateo O., a gang member in their neighborhood who had been persistently making advances towards her. Angelina fled, alone, to the United States and was apprehended at the border and detained. After a rare phone call home brought news that her 4-year-old was hospitalized in El Salvador, she chose not to appeal the US government’s decision to deport her in September 2014. Once back in El Salvador, Mateo resumed pursuing and threatening her, having his fellow gang members do so as well. She repeatedly rejected Mateo’s advances, but according to a statement of facts in an immigration court ruling, “he threatened to kill Angelina’s father and daughter if she did not accept to be ‘his woman.’” In October 2014, Angelina’s father took her daughter to church. She told a Human Rights Watch researcher what happened when she heard a knock at the door: I just opened the door, expecting it to be [my daughter returning home], but it was [Mateo]. He forced open the door because I started trying to close it on him. [Mateo] came inside and forced me to have sex with him for the first time. He took out his gun…. I was so scared that I obeyed…. When he left, I started crying. I didn’t say anything at the time, or even file a complaint to the police. I thought it would be worse if I did because I thought someone from the police would likely tell [Mateo]…. I didn’t want anyone to know what was happening…. He told me he was going to kill my father and my daughter if I reported the [original and three subsequent] rapes, because I was “his woman.” [He] hit me and told me that he wanted me all to himself. One month later, Mateo returned to Angelina’s home. This time her daughter was at home. Mateo told Angelina’s daughter to stay in the living room “watching cartoons” and “not to go to the bedroom.” He then “dragged [Angelina] to the bedroom, took out a gun, and told [her] to be quiet or [she] would see [her] daughter die before [her] eyes.” After he left, Angelina cried but did not tell anyone. She told an immigration court “sometimes it is worse to tell the police because they do not help.” Angelina was raped twice more by Mateo before fleeing again—this time with her daughter—to the United States. She was ultimately granted protection from deportation in the United States under a provision known as “withholding of removal,” and her daughter was granted asylum.  Torture, Other Ill-Treatment, or Excessive Use of Force  We investigated five separate cases of torture, other ill-treatment, or excessive use of force by police or soldiers against deportees that we know occurred between 2013 and 2019 and within five years of the person’s deportation. In interviews with deportees and their relatives or friends, we collected accounts of three male deportees from the United States who said they were beaten by police or soldiers during arrest, followed by beatings during their time in custody, which lasted between three days to over a year. One of these deportees, formerly a member of MS, told us that when police came to his home to arrest him he was unarmed and did not resist arrest. Police hit and kicked him before putting him in the patrol car, and then beat him repeatedly during his detention, which lasted for over a year. He told us that during his detention, police officers kicked him repeatedly in the testicles, threatened to kill him, and “asked me about other MS members and were saying that if I name someone from MS, that is, if I turned them in, they would leave me free.”  Salvadoran criminal sentencing tribunal decisions described police abuses of two additional deported men. In one case, a man deported four months earlier, who police accused of resisting arrest, was put in a patrol car and brought to a police station. Throughout, the police repeatedly hit and kicked him, including kicks with their boots to his neck and abdomen. The deported man sustained injuries requiring an operation for a ruptured pancreas and spleen, month-long hospitalization, and 60 days of post-release treatment. In the second case, a deportee who police accused of extortion, evading arrest, and shooting at police; claimed he was face down on the ground but nevertheless shot at by police agents. Once the agents took him into custody, the deportee claimed he was insulted, kicked in the face, and shot at again repeatedly. The deportee was taken to a hospital for his injuries and was later acquitted of all criminal charges.  Armed Attacks, Beatings, Extortion, and Death Threats by Gangs  We documented the cases of 33 individuals who known or suspected gang members threatened with death after their deportations. Presumed gang members subsequently beat three and shot and injured three others. Suspected gang members likewise extorted 13 deportees (including one beaten and one shot and injured). Alleged gang members subsequently killed 14 deportees (including six of those extorted). For these cases, we know the victimization was within five years or less of the deportation between 2013 and 2019.  Among those killed, known or suspected gang members threatened with death surviving relatives of at least four of the deportees killed. While gang members told three to leave their homes or they would be killed within as little as 24 hours, they told one to stay with her family and keep quiet. Jennifer B. explained to Human Rights Watch: “They [the gang members] threatened my sister [with whom Javier B. had wanted to live] that if she opened her mouth or left that place, they’d look for her everywhere and kill her. So, she remains there. … They’ve kept their mouths shut there.”  People Forced into Hiding  Most Human Rights Watch interviewees attempted to go into hiding in their own or different neighborhoods because they were afraid of gang members, police, or former intimate partners from whom they feared harm that authorities would or could not stop. US and Salvadoran authorities often make unrealistic assumptions about a particular individual’s ability to remain safe, thinking a person could easily relocate. For example, when Alexander N. told Salvadoran migration officials he was afraid to return to the home where his sister was taken and killed, they responded: “‘Why not go elsewhere?’”  Safe relocation in El Salvador is incredibly difficult for anyone. According to unverified estimates cited by the UN special rapporteur for extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, approximately 60,000 gang members reportedly operate in 247 of the 262 municipalities in the country. State authorities have been largely ineffective at protecting the population from gang or private violence, and Salvadoran security forces have themselves committed extrajudicial executions, sexual assaults, enforced disappearances, and torture throughout the country.  The few organizations now offering assistance to the internally displaced can together only provide services to several hundred people per year and even then, are typically delayed, and limited to helping a limited number of people and for a period of no more than three months. This leaves most of the estimated 285,000 internally displaced persons in El Salvador to rely on familial networks, or more commonly, as one survey with a nationally representative sample found, flee abroad.  For example, after learning gang members planned to kill him in his rural municipality, Gabriel G., a retired high-ranking officer with specialized training in the Salvadoran military in his forties, told Human Rights Watch he fled to the United States in 2018 after “the gang went to the police to tell them when, where, and how they’d kill me.” Gabriel’s wife and children have received threats because of his military service as well, and two of his sons fled El Salvador multiple times between 2013 and 2018 related to these threats. However, Gabriel had previously been deported from the US in 2008, after he went to the US seeking refuge because former guerillas were threatening him. Gabriel was detained in Texas and failed his reasonable fear interview. His prior deportation barred him from asylum under US law, so he had to meet the higher standards of withholding of removal, which means that it would be “more likely than not” that he would be persecuted, rather than the lower asylum standard of a well-founded fear of persecution. Alternatively, he had to show he merited protection under the Convention against Torture. Gabriel remembered US officials asked him if he had been tortured. He told Human Rights Watch, “I didn’t want to lie, because [what I consider torture] had not happened to me, although threats had been made, and they remained active.” Since being deported in 2018, Gabriel remains fearful and stays in hiding when he is not at work as a security guard, leaving his home as little as possible and refusing even to inform his wife of his weekly work schedule for fear that she might inadvertently tell others and the gang would attack him while he travels to work. He described to us how different gang members come to the gate outside his house to demand he turn over his work-issued firearm. He consistently refuses to hand over the weapon, and in response the gang members threaten to kill him.  At least 17 deported individuals whose cases we identified or investigated for this report attempted to hide from the violence or extortion they feared in the same neighborhoods they had originally fled. Two who were beaten and extorted, and one who was beaten, extorted, and raped have since fled El Salvador again. Seven are dead. Discussed more fully in Section IV below, individuals also relocated from one particularly violent neighborhood to another. In another case, a male deportee fled the particularly violent neighborhood where one gang killed his father, to a neighborhood where a different gang controlled the territory. Three additional male deportees attempted to go into hiding in a new location before they were killed or disappeared, according to press accounts.  Alexander N. Several months before our November 2018 interview with 20-year-old Alexander N. and his parents, men dressed in black identifying themselves as police arrived in the night. The men wanted only to take Alicia N., Alexander’s teenage sister. They tied up the rest of the family and posted two men outside to make sure they did not leave. The other men took 17-year-old Alicia with them. Not long after, the family heard a shot, seemingly a few blocks away. Once they broke free and felt sure the men outside were gone, they went toward it. They found Alicia dead with one bullet to her forehead. Alexander and his parents showed a Human Rights Watch researcher the photo of her body, splayed on the dirt, hands above her head and blood coming from the gunshot wound. After the killing, the press arrived. Nearly every Salvadoran media outlet covered the murder, some in more than one story. Some for several months. None could say definitively if the men in black were gang members of the neighborhood’s particularly strong gang clique, law enforcement, or so-called “extermination groups.” Alexander and his family suspect police involvement. In recent years, the Attorney General’s Office investigated a group, police chiefs and businessmen among them, for forming an extermination group who killed those they believed to be gang members in Alexander’s neighborhood and in surrounding municipalities. Alicia’s murder was at least the seventh in four months in their community; she was the second child to be killed, and the second female. More killings, including of two females, occurred in the same neighborhood before the year ended. Authorities found additional bodies in clandestine graves. A press report alleged a member of the gang had raped girls and young women in the neighborhood. Within 48 hours of his sister’s death, the killers called Alexander’s home and told his mother that they would come back and kill her son, Alexander, for “giving the press information” on the way they had killed her daughter. She and her husband could not bear the thought of losing their son too. She told us what little they had; they gave him to flee. Alexander’s father broke down when he told us he had decided, “My only child who remains can at least go.” Less than a month after his sister’s murder, Alexander was at the border in Texas. He told Human Rights Watch that he had told US authorities what happened to his sister and that he was afraid to return. At the seventh US immigration detention center he was held in, he got lucky: a group of volunteers worked with him and five or six other asylum seekers on how to present himself in his credible fear interview (the first stage of the US asylum process). US authorities determined Alexander had demonstrated credible fear and he was transferred to another detention center to present his case before the Immigration Court nearest it. A fellow detainee from Mexico helped him translate the proof he carried: photos, a news report, death certificate, and letters of support from his Catholic church, work, school, and City Hall. In our interview with him, Alexander appeared humble and shy. He had recently graduated high school. In his community, eye contact and talking could get you killed, he said. According to Alexander, after four hearings, at which he appeared without counsel, he was denied asylum. Alexander said, “There was no one to help me. I felt so bad. There was danger of return.” About a month later, US officials cuffed him at the wrists and ankles to deport him to El Salvador. Alexander and his family told us that the men in black have gone to other homes since then, and they see masked police and soldiers stroll their dirt roads. Alexander lives in constant fear, saying that he feels it “day and night.” His strategy: “I don’t go out. I hide.” He is not studying, working, or spending time with friends, despite his dreams to get a college degree and help his family. When asked how long this could last, Alexander’s mom said she did not know. “Meanwhile,” she said, “we fear.”  IV. Particularly Violent Neighborhoods  When people are deported to El Salvador, the original neighborhoods they lived in prior to their emigration may carry significant risks of disappearance, homicide, and sexual crime, such that living in safety at home is nearly impossible. These particularly violent neighborhoods (see Glossary for definition) tend to have not just a concentration of organized crime but also of abusive law enforcement actors, documented cases of domestic and sexual violence, and violence perpetrated by so-called “death squads” or “extermination groups” (as discussed in Section V).  Specific Neighborhoods, High Levels of Violence  According to government data, from 2013 to 2018, all of El Salvador’s 262 municipalities registered at least a homicide or sexual crime. In most municipalities, however, crime tends to concentrate in a small percentage of specific neighborhoods. Such neighborhoods register multiple homicides and sexual crimes each year. Many have also been the sites of clandestine graves containing victims who were kidnapped, disappeared, and often tortured before they were killed. Multiple actors, including gangs, authorities, those who present themselves as authorities, and private individuals are alleged to have committed these crimes. Victims include girls, boys, men, and women and those known or believed to be informants or witnesses. Visitors to these neighborhoods are also victims, and residents of these neighborhoods are victimized elsewhere because they are imputed to be affiliated with the gang that controls the neighborhood from which they fled.  Given persistent violence in these neighborhoods, individuals growing up in them likely experience multiple traumatic events. For example, an aid director for deported persons, in summarizing the case of a mother and her daughters who fled sexual harassment, extortion, and threats (but have since been deported from the US back to El Salvador), said of residents of such neighborhoods: “One [criminal] event does not tend to be it [for what drove them to flee].” The majority of directly impacted individuals we interviewed who originated from a particularly violent neighborhood recounted they or their loved ones being victims of multiple crimes before and after deportation, including witnessing or having loved ones abused, disappeared, or killed. Four deportees we interviewed had to live in the same home in which a family member had been killed. They—like other residents—may show symptoms of trauma. At time of writing, such particularly violent neighborhoods in El Salvador included but were not limited to:  Lourdes neighborhood of Colón municipality in La Libertad department;  Altavista neighborhood at the border of Ilopango, San Martín, and Tonacatepeque municipalities of San Salvador department, and surrounding areas like San José Flores neighborhood of Tonacatepeque municipality of San Salvador department;  San Roque neighborhood and surrounding neighborhoods like Zacamil of Mejicanos municipality in San Salvador department;  Iberia and San Jacinto neighborhoods of San Salvador municipality in San Salvador department;  La Campanera neighborhood of Soyapango municipality in San Salvador department;  Amapalita neighborhood of La Unión municipality in La Unión department;  El Platanar neighborhood of Moncagua municipality in San Miguel department;  Ciudad Pacífica, Milagro de la Paz and San Antonio Silva neighborhoods of San Miguel municipality in San Miguel department;  Tierra Blanca neighborhood of Jiquilisco municipality in Usulután department;  Chaguantique neighborhood and surrounding areas at the border of Jiquilisco and Puerto El Triunfo municipalities in Usulután department;  El Ojuste and La Poza neighborhoods of Usulután municipality in Usulután department;  El Junquillo neighborhood of Ahuachapán municipality in Ahuachapán department; and  Apaneca and surrounding neighborhoods of Chalchuapa municipality of Santa Ana department.  No publicly available dataset demonstrates what percentage of migrants leaving El Salvador come from hot spots of violence; however, among the cases of people deported from the United States who were subsequently harmed in El Salvador identified or investigated for this report, many had lived in the neighborhoods listed above. For example:  From 2006 to 2019, four deportees were reported killed in Lourdes neighborhood of Colón municipality , as was an uncle who reportedly died defending his deported nephew in a shootout in which the nephew and one other person with them were also injured.  , as was an uncle who reportedly died defending his deported nephew in a shootout in which the nephew and one other person with them were also injured. In 2017 and 2018, a Salvadoran-born individual who moved between El Salvador and the United States, and two deportees—who residents told reporters were cousins—were killed in El Platanar of Moncagua .  . In 2014, one deportee was reported killed in Tierra Blanca of Jiquilisco .  . Two deportees were killed in the La Poza neighborhood of Usulután municipality in 2014 and 2018.  in 2014 and 2018. In September 2017, according to press sources, in El Junquillo neighborhood of Ahuachapán municipality a deportee’s female partner, her mother, and her child were killed; one article reporting on this incident also reported that the deportee himself had been killed the day prior. An official in that region told Human Rights Watch two other deportees from the United States had also been killed in El Junquillo or adjacent Las Viñas in 2012 or 2013 and 2016. A separate official in the same region told reporters they “go [there] frequently” to investigate homicides.  a deportee’s female partner, her mother, and her child were killed; one article reporting on this incident also reported that the deportee himself had been killed the day prior. An official in that region told Human Rights Watch two other deportees from the United States had also been killed in El Junquillo or adjacent Las Viñas in 2012 or 2013 and 2016. A separate official in the same region told reporters they “go [there] frequently” to investigate homicides. In 2014, two deportees were reported killed near Cara Sucia neighborhood in San Francisco Menéndez municipality (where one’s brother was killed a month earlier).  Society and Authorities Stigmatize Certain Neighborhoods  According to a poll by the Salvadoran paper, La Prensa Gráfica, Salvadorans fear particular neighborhoods and try to avoid them. From 2008 to 2017, La Prensa Gráfica three times polled a representative sample of the population in El Salvador’s most populous municipalities, asking: “From what you know and have heard said, what is the most dangerous place in the municipality?” Residents’ responses included Altavista (and San Jose de las Flores next to it), San Roque, Iberia, La Campanera, Ciudad Pacífica, Milagro de la Paz, and San Francisco adjacent to Apaneca of Chalchuapa. These neighborhoods are often notorious beyond just residents. For example, in 2019, the Salvadoran investigative press outlet, El Faro, noted that Altavista, La Campanera, and Milagro de la Paz are nationally stigmatized.  For their security, multiple non-PNC governmental offices keep maps or appoint a long-serving staff member to inform others of neighborhoods where staff have been threatened or harmed in the past, and thus, they either cannot enter or only enter with a police presence. One police officer expressed concerns to Human Rights Watch that naming such neighborhoods can negatively impact their residents and make them “even hotter.”  Police statements to the press in articles reporting on crime sometimes solidified stigmatization. Police would describe homicide victims in these neighborhoods as either gang members, collaborators of gang members, or those with personal relationships to gangs or gang members, even when relatives told the press their loved ones who were killed had no such links. For one youth from Iberia, this stigma from authorities especially stung. He broke down in tears recalling to a reporter what a policeman told him about his neighborhood: “All of them that live in that community, they are rats.”  The stigmatization of these neighborhoods’ residents is partially due to perceived and real links between crime and poverty. The residents of these neighborhoods that Human Rights Watch interviewed reported monthly household incomes of less than US$500, and their homes were often composed of mud- or dirt-mixture for the walls, tin metal for the roof, bars to cover windows, and dirt floors. Similarly, two youth from one of the neighborhoods listed above, who fled in 2013 and were deported in 2018, made only $5 per day in the nearby fields; even in planting and harvesting season, they could not count on five days of work in a week. Another family whose young daughter fled with her grandmother in 2017 and was deported in 2018 did not have a home, and they instead moved from place to place in the neighborhood, living with hosts who would let them stay for brief periods if they paid for their use of utilities only.  One Salvadoran policeman said: “Evidently, there are places safer than others, and it is related to wealth levels. Poverty levels influence [crime]. We rarely go to residences where middle-class people live.” One criminal sentencing judge went further in his analysis of the links between poverty and crime to say that in these places, “We have to say it … the state has been absent.”  Nowhere Else to Go  Deportees often have nowhere to go in El Salvador except to live with family already residing in a particularly violent neighborhood. For example, Nohemy P. fled El Salvador at the age of nine in 2000 because she feared gang kidnapping and rape. She had lived two-thirds of her life in the US, had DACA status, and had three US-citizen children under the age of nine. However, US authorities near the Texas-Mexico border accused her of trafficking her own children across the border (she told us she had not crossed the border), told her “DACA was over,” and detained and deported her in the fall 2018. Upon arriving back in El Salvador, Nohemy had no choice but to live with an aunt in a violent neighborhood “because she is the only family we have here [now].” Nohemy’s mother, Leticia P., told Human Rights Watch that Nohemy and her two deported male cousins “almost don’t go out, because they’re afraid to do so.”  Deportees are often unable to find another, safer neighborhood to live in. Press accounts we identified for this report describe three male deportees’ attempts to hide in new neighborhoods before they were killed or disappeared. An FGR prosecutor told Human Rights Watch that “depending on the deportee’s [neighborhood], we do see changing addresses as a risk [for death].”  Deportees often cannot afford to relocate long distances away nor can they afford exclusive, gated residences with private security. An FGR prosecutor told Human Rights Watch: “People with few resources [who are displaced] have nowhere to go. Someone should be investigating that. Sometimes, it hurts me to observe that there is nothing more we [the authorities] can do for these people.” The brother of a young man killed approximately two years after his September 2013 deportation explained why his brother did not try to live elsewhere: “We don’t have resources to go moving around in El Salvador. Likewise, if he’d gone to a place without the gang [in our neighborhood], they [rival gang members] would have assumed [he was aligned with the gang in our neighborhood]. You are trapped in the same system.”  Individuals we interviewed for this report were repeatedly forced to move from one particularly violent neighborhood to another after being deported to El Salvador from the United States. For example, the neighborhood where Ransés I. grew up no longer existed when he was deported nearly 15 years later in 2015. Therefore, he went to an uncle’s home in a chronically violent neighborhood. He said: “One day, I went to the store not far [from my home] with my nephew who’d lived his whole life there.… Two [gang members] looked at me. Then, five more came and asked who I was, from where I was.… I told them I was deported.… I was there only a month [before I moved again].  In nearly all particularly violent neighborhoods, gang members, authorities, and residents view new arrivals with suspicion. Nelson E., after his most recent deportation from the US in October 2014, tried living on his own in a new neighborhood but soon had to flee that neighborhood. He told Human Rights Watch,  When I got back [in 2014], I didn’t want to live with my mom.… I had work. But one time, people arrived to rob me. They wanted my DUI [government-issued, photo identification]. They told me I couldn’t be there. They told me to remove myself from there. They said they would disappear me if I stayed … so I went back to my mom. This is the risk here. You cannot go where they do not know you.  It is likely, and especially dangerous, that a person who attempts to relocate inside El Salvador will end up in a neighborhood controlled by a different gang. A PNC officer told Human Rights Watch that among murdered deportees, including women, are those who “arrive to live in or visit a neighborhood different from the one they are from.” Irene J., said of her recently deported husband:  It actually worries me more [that he’s not in our old neighborhood]. Our neighborhood was MS-controlled, but where he is now is 18 [18 Revolucionarios or 18 Sureños]-controlled. If they realize that, they’ll take him out and kill him just for that. He is afraid of it, too, so he’s not going out at all. He can’t stay in one place. He’s having to move around.  V. State Actors as Perpetrators of Harm  Many authorities in El Salvador are dedicated to protecting Salvadoran citizens and ensuring justice in the country. However, authorities often face significant barriers to providing protection, especially—as discussed in the previous section—in particularly violent neighborhoods. These authorities and their families face serious threats themselves from gangs or from other authorities within their own government for the actions they may take to protect the public.  Data obtained by Human Rights Watch through a public information request submitted to El Salvador’s Attorney General Office’s (FGR) illustrate pervasive impunity. Nationwide, in 2018, authorities made arrests in approximately 22 percent of registered homicide cases. For homicides of boys, the 2018 clearance rate (meaning charges were filed) in El Salvador is 13.6 percent. The clearance rate for homicides in the US (adults and children) was several times higher at 62 percent; in many European countries the rate is above 75 percent. For sexual crimes, authorities in El Salvador made arrests in only 9.5 percent of registered cases in 2018. The comparable clearance rate for sexual crimes in the US was 33.4 percent in 2018. For sexual crimes against girls in El Salvador, the 2018 clearance rate was 7.6 percent. Low clearance rates can occur for a number of reasons, but in El Salvador, the state is frequently either unable, due to limited resources, or unwilling, because of corruption, infiltration and threats, to protect its citizens.  In this report, we documented cases in which government authorities were responsible for committing grave abuses against deportees in particularly violent neighborhoods. These abuses—alongside low arrest, hearing, and conviction rates—are especially concerning, because they contribute to residents’ perception that authorities are persecutors, rather than protectors facing structural limits on their ability to successfully pursue their work.  Enrico X., a resident of a particularly violent neighborhood, told Human Rights Watch about his state of mind after police killed his cousin, a former gang member, at point blank range in public in 2016 or 2017 (after the cousin had been deported from the US in 2016 or 2017): “I became wary of the police even more after they killed my cousin in this manner…. I was afraid to report [other crimes] to them.”  El Salvador’s crime and insecurity should be seen within the context of the power, control, and violence imposed by gangs, and the state’s feeble struggles to protect public safety. Violence and killings occur against a backdrop of “armed confrontations,” when authorities report being called to an area or on a routine patrol, are attacked with gunfire and respond with reportedly defensive fire. In 2016, the Central American Institute of Investigations for Development and Social Change (INCIDE) reported an increase of these incidents in El Salvador between state actors and gangs, with 142 incidents in 2013, 256 incidents in 2014 and 676 incidents that left 359 people dead in 2015.  Unable or Unwilling to Protect  There are many reasons why authorities are unable or unwilling to help protect Salvadoran citizens who are afraid for their safety, including the fact that they themselves are monitored and threatened, authorities’ offices have also been infiltrated by gangs, they lack resources, and carry large caseloads. Women victims of violence face particular obstacles in seeking protection or justice, due to the inadequacy of Salvadoran laws and deeply entrenched institutional resistance to gender equality, which has led to, among other problems, insufficient funding for investigation and law enforcement focused on violence against women, and virtual impunity for the failure of governmental officials to carry out their responsibilities.  For this report, we interviewed several individuals who attempted to seek help from Salvadoran",Deported to Danger,true
454,272550226107746940822145255262880376936,"A wide-ranging domestic terrorism investigation of ""The Base,"" a militant neo-Nazi group, has culminated in the arrests of seven alleged members last week and has provided extensive new details about the inside operations of an organization that authorities say advocates for a ""violent insurgency"" to overthrow the U.S. government.  The investigation comes amid an increased focus on domestic terrorism and white supremacy in the United States and fear that such groups are joining forces with like-minded individuals overseas. And it came to light in the context of a controversial Richmond, Virginia gun rally where alleged members of The Base plotted to attack police officers and civilians.  According to a review of court documents released in cases out of Maryland, Georgia and Wisconsin over the past week, investigators believe the group was founded “in or around July 2018” by white nationalists who look to promote and plot acts of violence with an overarching goal of inciting a race war to create “a white ethno-state.”  “Members of The Base communicate with each other through online platforms and encrypted online messaging applications and chat rooms,” FBI special agent Jessica Krueger wrote in an affidavit filed in a Wisconsin District Court last week. “In these communications, they have discussed, among other things, acts of violence against minorities (including African Americans and Jewish Americans), Base military training camps, and ways to make improvised explosive devices.”  Three alleged members of the group were arrested in Maryland and Delaware on federal gun and immigration charges. Three others were arrested in Georgia on state gang charges and conspiracy to commit murder. Another man was arrested in Wisconsin and charged with conspiracy to vandalize a synagogue.  According to a court filing Tuesday in Maryland, The Base’s leaders are “particularly interested in applicants with military and explosives backgrounds.”  “Applicants submit an application form, which includes questions regarding the applicant’s current associations with white supremacist organizations; the applicant’s military, science, and engineering experiences and training; and the applicant’s race and gender,” the filing said.  It’s not entirely clear, based on the court filings, how many followers the group has -- though investigators have identified what they say is a clear leadership structure and found that members had divided into several separate “regional chapters.”  For instance, one such chapter in Wisconsin is identified as the “Great Lakes cell,” whose members organized an armed training session after passing out recruitment fliers at Marquette University in July of last year, according to the court filings.  “The Base cells have a significant degree of autonomy regarding their activities, and criminal conduct is typically not centrally coordinated in order to foster “plausible deniability” among those not directly involved,” an FBI affidavit said.  The FBI says it gained access to The Base’s encrypted online messaging application in July 2019, when an undercover agent participated in an online vetting interview and then personally met with members of the group in Georgia.  For months, according to the FBI, the agent continued meeting and participating in weapons training exercises with three members of The Base, who were arrested on state charges last week after the agent revealed their alleged plot to assassinate two members of the radical group ‘Antifa.’  From those interactions and The Base’s online messaging, investigators say they believe members participated in such training exercises in preparation for “The Boogaloo,” a moniker that, according to the authorities, the group’s members use to “describe the collapse of the United States and subsequent race war.”  One alleged member of the group arrested last week, former Canadian army reservist Patrik Mathews, had allegedly invoked ""The Boogaloo"" in connection to an attack the group planned to conduct on a pro-gun rights rally that occurred in Richmond over the weekend, according to the FBI.  “You want to create f----- some instability, while the Virginia situation is happening, make other things happen, derail some rail lines… like shut down the highways… you know, you can kick off the economic collapse of the U.S. within a week, after the boog starts,” Mathews said in a conversation federal agents say was recorded in his Delaware residence.  During a so-called ‘sneak-and-peek’ search of his residence prior to Mathews’ arrest, agents took pictures of items used to assemble assault rifles, “go-bags” with military-supplies like ‘Meals-Ready-To-Eat’ (MREs), and found several videos of Mathews in a gas-mask where he discussed killing people “in furtherance of the movement,” according to an FBI affidavit  “If you are not getting physically fit, if you are not getting armed, if you do not acquiring weapons, ammunition, and training right… now, then you should be preparing to do what needs to be done,” Mathews said in one video, according to FBI documents. “Derail some [sic] trains, kill some people, and poison some water supplies.”  A magistrate judge in Maryland ordered Mathews to remain in detention pending his trial, in which he has not yet entered a plea on federal gun and immigration charges, related to an alleged illegal entry into the U.S.  At a hearing Wednesday, Matthews' lawyer defended his client.  “One man’s domestic terrorist can be another man’s exercise of his First Amendment rights,” said the lawyer, Joseph Balter.  “This is a very dangerous person, espousing very dangerous beliefs,” the judge said Wednesday.  According to authorities, Mathews’ alleged involvement in The Base, after they say he entered the country illegally in August of last year, underscores their concerns that its influence stretches well beyond the U.S.  According to court filings, investigators say the group has been “building” a coalition “within the United States and abroad” and specifically mentioned members communicating with individuals in the United Kingdom and at least one member who discussed traveling to Ukraine, “to fight with nationalists there.”  Just last week, the Justice Department’s top terrorism coordinator said that the threat facing the U.S. from potential domestic terrorists is shifting in nature and becoming an increasingly transnational issue, with law enforcement seeing more Americans engaging and finding inspiration from overseas right-wing extremist groups -- in some cases even traveling abroad to meet with their members.  ""This issue in many respects has become transnational in nature,"" DOJ’s counsel for domestic terrorism Thomas Brzozowski said during an event at George Washington University. ""Some folks cite one another, others gain or gather support from another, use the same contacts and techniques without any demonstrable connection that would constitute conspiracy or things of that nature.”  Brzozowski specifically pointed to the neo-Nazi group Atomwaffen, whose members have traveled to train with right-wing groups in Ukraine and eastern Europe. According to prosecutors, some Atomwaffen members have also joined ranks with The Base.","Inside the neo-Nazi hate group 'The Base,' which is the center of an FBI investigation",true
455,44552698923272633765331931773245091984,"DENVER—Colorado’s governor signed bills Wednesday that place new restrictions on firearms, signaling a change for Democrats who have traditionally shied away from gun control in a state with a pioneer tradition of gun ownership and self-reliance.  The legislation thrust Colorado into the national spotlight as a potential test of how far the country might be willing to go with new gun restrictions after the horror of mass killings at an Aurora movie theater and a Connecticut elementary school.  Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper signed bills that require background checks for private and online gun sales and ban ammunition magazines that hold more than 15 rounds.  The debate in the Democratic-controlled Legislature was intense, and Republicans warned that voters would make Democrats pay. The bills failed to garner a single Republican vote.  The bills’ approval came exactly eight months after dozens of people were shot in Aurora, and a day after the executive director of the state Corrections Department, Tom Clements, was shot and killed at his home. Hickenlooper signed the legislation right after speaking with reporters about Clements’ slaying.  Hickenlooper said large-capacity magazines “have the potential to turn killers into killing machines.” He also said he realized some gun owners may be inconvenienced but that “the potential for damage seems to outweigh, significantly, the inconvenience that people would have,” he said.  The bills signal a historic change for Democrats in a state where owning a gun is as common as owning a car in some rural areas.  “He just slapped rural Colorado right in the face,” said Republican Sen. Brophy, who represents an eastern plains district. “They are overwhelmingly upset about this.”  Both bills take effect July 1. People who currently own larger-capacity magazines will be able to keep them.  At the signing ceremony, Hickenlooper was surrounded by lawmakers who sponsored the bills, and relatives of mass shootings. Hickenlooper also signed requiring buyers to pay fees for background checks.  Each time he signed a bill, applause erupted from lawmakers and their guests, who included Jane Dougherty, whose sister was killed in the attack at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Conn.; Sandy Phillips, whose daughter was killed in Aurora; and Tom Mauser, whose son was killed in the 1999 Columbine shooting in Colorado.  Phillips, who lost daughter Jessica Ghawi, reminded Hickenlooper that it was the eight-month anniversary of the theater rampage.  “You’ve given us a real gift today,” she told the governor.  Later, Phillips added: “Thank you so much. You’re leading the entire country.”  Dougherty thanked Hickenlooper with tears in her eyes. Mauser also expressed gratitude.  “I knew it would be a long haul,” he said. “But I had faith in the people of Colorado.”  Democratic Rep. Rhonda Fields, who represents the district that includes the Aurora theater, said the governor had signed “common-sense legislation.”  “Gun violence is a problem nationwide, and sadly in the state of Colorado, we are all too familiar with some of these tragedies,” Fields.  Lawmakers debated firearms proposals after the Columbine High School shooting, and began requiring background checks for buyers at gun shows. But nothing they did then was as sweeping as the proposals they took up this year.  This year, Colorado lawmakers succeeded while members of their party stumbled in other states.  Washington state’s Democrat-controlled House failed this month to pass a universal background check bill. A bill requiring background checks at gun shows in New Mexico also stalled in that Democrat-led Legislature.  Republicans have warned that voters will punish Hickenlooper and other Democrats who voted in favor of the measures.  “The real solution here is at the ballot box in 2014,” Brophy said.  Republicans have said limiting magazine sizes will drive jobs from the state, and ultimately won’t prevent criminals from getting larger magazines in other states.  One Colorado-based manufacturer of ammunition magazines disclosed plans to relocate because of the new restrictions.  Police chiefs in urban areas supported the bills, but some rural county sheriffs opposed the new background checks, arguing the move is unenforceable and endangers Second Amendment rights.  Hickenlooper said law enforcement should try to find common ground.  “This shouldn’t be rural versus urban. We are one state,” he said.  ———  Associated Press writer Kristen Wyatt contributed to this report.  ———  Find Ivan Moreno on Twitter: http://twitter.com/IvanJourno",Colorado governor signs landmark gun bills,true

(Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)  At the Interior Department’s headquarters in downtown Washington, Secretary Ryan Zinke has revived an arcane military ritual that no one can remember ever happening in the federal government.  A security staffer takes the elevator to the seventh floor, climbs the stairs to the roof and hoists a special secretarial flag whenever Zinke enters the building. When the secretary goes home for the day or travels, the flag — a blue banner emblazoned with the agency’s bison seal flanked by seven white stars representing the Interior bureaus — comes down.  In Zinke’s absence, the ritual is repeated to raise an equally obscure flag for Deputy Secretary David Bernhardt.  Responding this week to questions from The Washington Post, a spokeswoman for Zinke, a former Navy SEAL commander, defended the Navy flag-flying tradition as “a major sign of transparency.”  “Ryan Zinke is proud and honored to lead the Department of the Interior, and is restoring honor and tradition to the department, whether it’s flying the flag when he is in garrison or restoring traditional access to public lands,” press secretary Heather Swift said in an email.    Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke speaks at the Heritage Foundation in Washington last month. At right is his special secretarial flag. (Zach Gibson/Bloomberg News)  Zinke, a Stetson-wearing former Montana congressman who has cultivated an image as a rugged outdoorsman, has come under a harsh spotlight in recent weeks for behavior criticized as extravagant for a public official. The agency’s inspector general opened an investigation after he ran up bills for travel on chartered jets and mixed business with political appearances, sometimes accompanied by his wife, Lola. It’s one of five probes underway of Cabinet secretaries’ travel.  Zinke upset some of the 70,000 employees at the agency that manages public lands by stating that 30 percent of the workers are “not loyal to the flag” in a speech to oil and gas executives. It is unclear whether the reference was literal or figurative.  Zinke rode to work on horseback on his first day in office and displays animal heads on his wood-paneled office walls. For a while, he kept a glass-case display of hunting knives but was asked to remove them because of security risks, according to people familiar with the decision.  He has commissioned commemorative coins with his name on them to give to staff and visitors, but the cost to taxpayers is unclear. Zinke’s predecessors and some other Cabinet secretaries have coins bearing agency seals, but not personalized ones.  The flag ritual is unique in President Trump’s administration. The White House does not raise the presidential flag when Trump alights at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. There is no defense secretary’s flag atop the Pentagon.  Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, like his predecessors, has a personal flag that flies beside the U.S. flag in front of the department’s Foggy Bottom headquarters. But it’s there whether Tillerson is in the building or not.  “We’re talking about Cabinet members and federal buildings, not the Queen of England and Buckingham Palace,” said Chris Lu, deputy labor secretary in the Obama administration, referring to the British tradition of announcing the queen’s presence by raising her personal heraldic flag.    Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke commissioned commemorative coins with his name on them to give to staff and visitors. (Obtained by The Washington Post)  “If we had a secretarial flag at the Obama Labor Department, we never bothered to locate it or use it,” Lu said.  Retired Army Col. Steven Warren, who ran the Pentagon’s press operation before retiring this year, could not recall the place in Washington hierarchy represented by the raising of a federal official’s personal flag.  “Is he trying to send a message?” Warren wondered.  “Is he big on pomp and circumstance, or is this a case of ‘Look at me?’ ”  Personal flags for federal government officials have a proud, if arcane, history that originated with the secretary of the Navy in 1866, to help sailing ships in the fleet recognize which one carried the naval commander. The Coast Guard and secretary of war wanted one, too.  By the early 20th century, the civilian heads of the Treasury, Commerce and Labor departments had flags.  The first one for Interior was adopted in 1917.  “If you were the secretary of agriculture, you asked yourself, ‘Hey, the secretary of war has a flag, how come I don’t have one?’ ” said Joseph McMillan, a retired Defense Department official and student of flag history from Alexandria who is president of the American Heraldry Society.  The flags proliferated by World War II, with banners for subordinate officials from undersecretaries to assistant attorneys general.  Back when security was not a concern, official government vehicles would display a high-ranking official’s personal flag on its left front fender, with the American flag flanking the right. They were considered pretentious, McMillan said, and eventually went out of fashion.  At Lady Liberty Flag and Flagpole in Austin, one of the largest flag vendors for federal offices, Sandra Dee Merritt said she sells 300 to 500 department flags a year to various Interior offices.  Secretarial flags are no longer in demand. “I haven’t sold any of those individual secretarial flags to any agency in forever,” Merritt said.  Raising a personal flag to mark an official’s presence remains a custom in the military. Field commanders often display their unit’s flag when they are at headquarters to signify that the boss is in.  But the personal flag, whether belonging to a general or a Cabinet secretary, stays behind the desk, if it’s there at all.  By flying his flag, Zinke is doing exactly what the flag was designed for, McMillan said. Yet he’s skeptical. The Interior Department is not the Navy.  “I’m all about tradition,” McMillan said. “But I kind of have an aversion to militarizing everything in our government. The world doesn’t need to know the secretary of the Interior is in the building.”",Where’s Zinke? The interior secretary’s special flag offers clues.,true
457,11574038183170737990271756777451485089,"Key Points Heat waves are occurring more often than they used to in major cities across the United States. Their frequency has increased steadily, from an average of two heat waves per year during the 1960s to six per year during the 2010s (see Figure 1).  In recent years, the average heat wave in major U.S. urban areas has been about four days long. This is about a day longer than the average heat wave in the 1960s (see Figure 1).  The average heat wave season across the 50 cities in this indicator is 47 days longer now than it was in the 1960s (see Figure 1). Heat waves that occur earlier in the spring or later in the fall can catch people off-guard and increase exposure to the health risks associated with heat waves.  Heat waves have become more intense over time. During the 1960s, the average heat wave across the 50 cities in Figures 1 and 2 was 2.0°F above the local 85 th percentile threshold. During the 2010s, the average heat wave has been 2.5°F above the local threshold (see Figure 1).  percentile threshold. During the 2010s, the average heat wave has been 2.5°F above the local threshold (see Figure 1). Of the 50 metropolitan areas in this indicator, 46 experienced a statistically significant increase in heat wave frequency between the 1960s and 2010s. Heat wave duration has increased significantly in 26 of these locations, the length of the heat wave season in 44, and intensity in 16 (see Figure 2).  Longer-term records show that heat waves in the 1930s remain the most severe in recorded U.S. history (see Figure 3). The spike in Figure 3 reflects extreme, persistent heat waves in the Great Plains region during a period known as the “Dust Bowl.” Poor land use practices and many years of intense drought contributed to these heat waves by depleting soil moisture and reducing the moderating effects of evaporation.6  Background A series of unusually hot days is referred to as an extreme heat event or a heat wave. Heat waves are more than just uncomfortable: they can lead to illness and death, particularly among older adults, the very young, and other vulnerable populations (see the Heat-Related Deaths and Heat-Related Illnesses indicators).1 Prolonged exposure to excessive heat can lead to other impacts as well—for example, damaging crops, injuring or killing livestock, and increasing the risk of wildfires. Prolonged periods of extreme heat can lead to power outages as heavy demands for air conditioning strain the power grid. Unusually hot days and multi-day heat waves are a natural part of day-to-day variation in weather. As the Earth’s climate warms, however, hotter-than-usual days and nights are becoming more common (see the High and Low Temperatures indicator) and heat waves are expected to become more frequent and intense.2 Increases in these extreme heat events can lead to more heat-related illnesses and deaths, especially if people and communities do not take steps to adapt.3 Even small increases in extreme heat can result in increased deaths and illnesses.4  About the Indicator This indicator examines trends over time in four key characteristics of heat waves in the United States: Frequency: the number of heat waves that occur every year.  Duration: the length of each individual heat wave, in days.  Season length: the number of days between the first heat wave of the year and the last.  Intensity: how hot it is during the heat wave. Heat waves can be defined in many different ways. For consistency across the country, Figures 1 and 2 define a heat wave as a period of two or more consecutive days when the daily minimum apparent temperature (the actual temperature adjusted for humidity) in a particular city exceeds the 85th percentile of historical July and August temperatures (1981–2010) for that city. This definition is useful for several reasons: The most serious health impacts of a heat wave are often associated with high temperatures at night, which is usually the daily minimum. 5 The human body needs to cool off at night, especially after a hot day. If the air stays too warm at night, the body faces extra strain as the heart pumps harder to try to regulate body temperature.  The human body needs to cool off at night, especially after a hot day. If the air stays too warm at night, the body faces extra strain as the heart pumps harder to try to regulate body temperature. Adjusting for humidity is important because when humidity is high, water does not evaporate as easily, so it is harder for the human body to cool off by sweating. That is why health warnings about extreme heat are often based on the “heat index,” which combines temperature and humidity.  The 85 th percentile of July and August temperatures equates to the nine hottest days in a typical summer. A temperature that is typically only recorded nine times during the hottest part of the year is rare enough that most people would consider it to be unusually hot.  percentile of July and August temperatures equates to the nine hottest days in a typical summer. A temperature that is typically only recorded nine times during the hottest part of the year is rare enough that most people would consider it to be unusually hot. By using the 85th percentile for each individual city, Figures 1 and 2 define “unusual” in terms of local conditions. After all, a specific temperature like 95°F might be unusually hot in one city but perfectly normal in another. Plus, people in relatively warm regions (such as the Southwest) may be better acclimated and adapted to hot weather. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) calculated apparent temperature for this indicator based on temperature and humidity measurements from long-term weather stations, which are generally located at airports. Figures 1 and 2 focus on the 50 most populous U.S. metropolitan areas that have recorded weather data from a consistent location without many missing days over the time period examined. The year 1961 was chosen as the starting point because most major cities have collected consistent data since at least that time. Figure 3 provides another perspective to gauge the size and frequency of prolonged heat wave events. It shows the U.S. Annual Heat Wave Index, which tracks the occurrence of heat wave conditions across the contiguous 48 states from 1895 to 2020. This index defines a heat wave as a period lasting at least four days with an average temperature that would only be expected to occur once every 10 years, based on the historical record. The index value for a given year depends on how often such severe heat waves occur and how widespread they are.  About the Data Indicator Notes As cities develop, vegetation is often lost, and more surfaces are paved or covered with buildings. This type of development can lead to higher temperatures—part of an effect called an “urban heat island.” Compared with surrounding rural areas, built-up areas have higher temperatures, especially at night.10 Urban growth since 1961 may have contributed to part of the increase in heat waves that Figures 1 and 2 show for certain cities. This indicator does not attempt to adjust for the effects of development in metropolitan areas, because it focuses on the temperatures to which people are actually exposed, regardless of whether the trends reflect a combination of climate change and other factors. Figures 1 and 2 focus on the 50 most populous metropolitan areas that had complete data for the entire period from 1961 to 2019. Several large metropolitan areas did not have enough data, such as New York City, Houston, Minneapolis–St. Paul, and Denver. In some of these cases, the best available long-term weather station was relocated sometime between 1961 and 2019—for example, when a new airport opened. As noted above, Figures 1 and 2 focus on daily minimum temperatures because of the connection between nighttime cooling (or lack thereof) and human health. For reference, EPA’s technical documentation for this indicator shows the results of a similar analysis based on daily maximum temperatures. Temperature data are less certain for the early part of the 20th century because fewer stations were operating at that time. In addition, measuring devices and methods have changed over time, and some stations have moved. The data in Figure 3 have been adjusted to the extent possible to account for some of these influences and biases, however, and these uncertainties are not sufficient to change the fundamental nature of the trends. Data Sources Figures 1 and 2 are adapted from an analysis by Habeeb et al. (2015).11 They are based on temperature and humidity measurements from weather stations managed by NOAA’s National Weather Service. NOAA calculated daily apparent temperatures for metropolitan areas and published the results at: www.ncdc.noaa.gov/societal-impacts/heat-stress/data.

458,268382888379242065465215358900330032405,"“The greenhouse effect is here.”  – Jim Hansen, 23rd June 1988, Senate Testimony  The first transient climate projections using GCMs are 30 years old this year, and they have stood up remarkably well.  We’ve looked at the skill in the Hansen et al (1988) (pdf) simulations before (back in 2008), and we said at the time that the simulations were skillful and that differences from observations would be clearer with a decade or two’s more data. Well, another decade has passed!        How should we go about assessing past projections? There have been updates to historical data (what we think really happened to concentrations, emissions etc.), none of the future scenarios (A, B, and C) were (of course) an exact match to what happened, and we now understand (and simulate) more of the complex drivers of change which were not included originally.  The easiest assessment is the crudest. What were the temperature trends predicted and what were the trends observed? The simulations were run in 1984 or so, and that seems a reasonable beginning date for a trend calculation through to the last full year available, 2017. The modeled changes were as follows:  Scenario A: 0.33±0.03ºC/decade (95% CI)  Scenario B: 0.28±0.03ºC/decade (95% CI)  Scenario C: 0.16±0.03ºC/decade (95% CI)  The observed changes 1984-2017 are 0.19±0.03ºC/decade (GISTEMP), or 0.21±0.03ºC/decade (Cowtan and Way), lying between Scenario B and C, and notably smaller than Scenario A. Compared to 10 years ago, the uncertainties on the trends have halved, and so the different scenarios are more clearly distinguished. By this measure it is clear that the scenarios bracketed the reality (as they were designed to), but did not match it exactly. Can we say more by looking at the details of what was in the scenarios more specifically? Yes, we can.  This is what the inputs into the climate model were (CO 2 , N 2 O, CH 4 and CFC amounts) compared to observations (through to 2014):  Estimates of CO 2 growth in Scenarios A and B were quite good, but estimates of N 2 O and CH 4 overshot what happened (estimates of global CH 4 have been revised down since the 1980s). CFCs were similarly overestimated (except in scenario C which was surprisingly prescient!). Note that when scenarios were designed and started (in 1983), the Montreal Protocol had yet to be signed, and so anticipated growth in CFCs in Scenarios A and B was pessimistic. The additional CFC changes in Scenario A compared to Scenario B were intended to produce a maximum estimate of what other forcings (ozone pollution, other CFCs etc.) might have done.  But the model sees the net effect of all the trace gases (and whatever other effects are included, which in this case is mainly volcanoes). So what was the net forcing since 1984 in each scenario?  There are multiple ways of defining the forcings, and the exact value in any specific model is a function of the radiative transfer code and background climatology. Additionally, knowing exactly what the forcings in the real world have been is hard to do precisely. Nonetheless, these subtleties are small compared to the signal, and it’s clear that the forcings in Scenario A and B will have overshot the real world.        If we compare the H88 forcings since 1984 to an estimate of the total anthropogenic forcings calculated for the CMIP5 experiments (1984 through to 2012), the main conclusion is very clear – forcing in scenario A is almost a factor of two larger (and growing) than our best estimate of what happened, and scenario B overshoots by about 20-30%. By contrast, scenario C undershoots by about 40% (which gets worse over time). The slight differences because of the forcing definition, whether you take forcing efficacy into account and independent estimates of the effects of aerosols etc. are small effects. We can also ignore the natural forcings here (mostly volcanic), which is also a small effect over the longer term (Scenarios B and C had an “El Chichon”-like volcano go off in 1995).  The amount that scenario B overshoots the CMIP5 forcing is almost equal to the over-estimate of the CFC trends. Without that, it would have been spot on (the over-estimates of CH 4 and N 2 O are balanced by missing anthropogenic forcings).  The model predictions were skillful  Predictive skill is defined as the whether the model projection is better than you would have got assuming some reasonable null hypothesis. With respect to these projections, this was looked at by Hargreaves (2010) and can be updated here. The appropriate null hypothesis (which at the time would have been the most skillful over the historical record) would be a prediction of persistence of the 20 year mean, ie. the 1964-1983 mean anomaly. Whether you look at the trends or annual mean data, this gives positive skill for all the model projections regardless of the observational dataset used. i.e. all scenarios gave better predictions than a forecast based on persistence.        What do these projections tell us about the real world?  Can we make an estimate of what the model would have done with the correct forcing? Yes. The trends don’t completely scale with the forcing but a reduction of 20-30% in the trends of Scenario B to match the estimated forcings from the real world would give a trend of 0.20-0.22ºC/decade – remarkably close to the observations. One might even ask how would the sensitivity of the model need to be changed to get the observed trend? The equilibrium climate sensitivity of the Hansen model was 4.2ºC for doubled CO 2 , and so you could infer that a model with a sensitivity of say, 3.6ºC, would likely have had a better match (assuming that the transient climate response scales with the equilibrium value which isn’t quite valid).  Hansen was correct to claim that greenhouse warming had been detected  In June 1988, at the Senate hearing linked above, Hansen stated clearly that he was 99% sure that we were already seeing the effects of anthropogenic global warming. This is a statement about the detection of climate change – had the predicted effect ‘come out of the noise’ of internal variability and other factors? And with what confidence?  In retrospect, we can examine this issue more carefully. By estimating the response we would see in the global means from just natural forcings, and including a measure of internal variability, we should be able to see when the global warming signal emerged.        The shading in the figure (showing results from the CMIP5 GISS ModelE2), is a 95% confidence interval around the “all natural forcings” simulations. From this it’s easy to see that temperatures in 1988 (and indeed, since about 1978) fall easily outside the uncertainty bands. 99% confidence is associated with data more than ~2.6 standard deviations outside of the expected range, and even if you think that the internal variability is underestimated in this figure (double it to be conservative), the temperatures in any year past 1985 are more than 3 s.d. above the “natural” expectation. That is surely enough clarity to retrospectively support Hansen’s claim.  At the time however, the claim was more controversial; modeling was in it’s early stages, and estimates of internal variability and the relevant forcings were poorer, and so Hansen was going out on a little bit of a limb based on his understanding and insight into the problem. But he was right.  Misrepresentations and lies  Over the years, many people have misrepresented what was predicted and what could have been expected. Most (in)famously, Pat Michaels testified in Congress about climate changes and claimed that the predictions were wrong by 300% (!) – but his conclusion was drawn from a doctored graph (Cato Institute version) of the predictions where he erased the lower two scenarios:  Undoubtedly there will be claims this week that Scenario A was the most accurate projection of the forcings [Narrator: It was not]. Or they will show only the CO 2 projection (and ignore the other factors). Similarly, someone will claim that the projections have been “falsified” because the temperature trends in Scenario B are statistically distinguishable from those in the real world. But this sleight of hand is trying to conflate a very specific set of hypotheses (the forcings combined with the model used) which no-one expects (or expected) to perfectly match reality, with the much more robust and valid prediction that the trajectory of greenhouse gases would lead to substantive warming by now – as indeed it has.

459,318773687242765777002562577675268584515,"This is the first of a two-part “Explained” on the scientific concepts underlying the concept of the greenhouse effect and global climate change.    When people talk about global warming or the greenhouse effect, the main underlying scientific concept that describes the process is radiative forcing. And despite all the recent controversy over leaked emails and charges of poorly sourced references in the last Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, the basic concept of radiative forcing is one on which scientists — whatever their views on global warming or the IPCC — all seem to agree. Disagreements come into play in determining the actual value of that number.    The concept of radiative forcing is fairly straightforward. Energy is constantly flowing into the atmosphere in the form of sunlight that always shines on half of the Earth’s surface. Some of this sunlight (about 30 percent) is reflected back to space and the rest is absorbed by the planet. And like any warm object sitting in cold surroundings — and space is a very cold place — some energy is always radiating back out into space as invisible infrared light. Subtract the energy flowing out from the energy flowing in, and if the number is anything other than zero, there has to be some warming (or cooling, if the number is negative) going on.    It’s as if you have a kettle full of water, which is at room temperature. That means everything is at equilibrium, and nothing will change except as small random variations. But light a fire under that kettle, and suddenly there will be more energy flowing into that water than radiating out, and the water is going to start getting hotter.    In short, radiative forcing is a direct measure of the amount that the Earth’s energy budget is out of balance.    For the Earth’s climate system, it turns out that the level where this imbalance can most meaningfully be measured is the boundary between the troposphere (the lowest level of the atmosphere) and the stratosphere (the very thin upper layer). For all practical purposes, where weather and climate are concerned, this boundary marks the top of the atmosphere.    While the concept is simple, the analysis required to figure out the actual value of this number for the Earth right now is much more complicated and difficult. Many different factors have an effect on this balancing act, and each has its own level of uncertainty and its own difficulties in being precisely measured. And the individual contributions to radiative forcing cannot simply be added together to get the total, because some of the factors overlap — for example, some different greenhouse gases absorb and emit at the same infrared wavelengths of radiation, so their combined warming effect is less than the sum of their individual effects.    In its most recent report in 2007, the IPCC produced the most comprehensive estimate to date of the overall radiative forcing affecting the Earth today. Ronald Prinn, the TEPCO Professor of Atmospheric Science and director of MIT’s Center for Global Change Science, was one of the lead authors of that chapter of the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report. Radiative forcing “was very small in the past, when global average temperatures were not rising or falling substantially,” he explains. For convenience, most researchers choose a “baseline” year before the beginning of world industrialization — usually either 1750 or 1850 — as the zero point, and compute radiative forcing in relation to that base. The IPCC uses 1750 as its base year and it is the changes in the various radiative forcing agents since then that are counted.    Thus radiative forcing, measured in watts per square meter of surface, is a direct measure of the impact that recent human activities — including not just greenhouse gases added to the air, but also the impact of deforestation, which changes the reflectivity of the surface — are having on changing the planet’s climate. However, this number also includes any natural effects that may also have changed during that time, such as changes in the sun’s output (which has produced a slight warming effect) and particles spewed into the atmosphere from volcanoes (which generally produce a very short-lived cooling effect, or negative forcing).    Although all of the factors that influence radiative forcing have uncertainties associated with them, one factor overwhelmingly affects the uncertainty: the effects of aerosols (small airborne particles) in the atmosphere. That’s because these effects are highly complex and often contradictory. For example, bright aerosols (like sulfates from coal-burning) are a cooling mechanism, whereas dark aerosols (like black carbon from diesel exhausts) lead to warming. Also, adding sulfate aerosols to clouds leads to smaller but more abundant droplets that increase cloud reflectivity, thus cooling the planet.    “The error bars in the greenhouse gas forcing are very small,” Prinn says. “The biggest uncertainty in defining radiative forcing comes from aerosols.”    So, given all these factors and their range of errors, what’s the answer? The current level of radiative forcing, according to the IPCC AR4, is 1.6 watts per square meter (with a range of uncertainty from 0.6 to 2.4). That may not sound like much, Prinn says, until you consider the total land area of the Earth and multiply it out, which gives a total warming effect of about 800 terawatts — more than 50 times the world’s average rate of energy consumption, which is currently about 15 terawatts.    Part two of this series will examine the concept of climate sensitivity, which determines how much the planet’s temperature will change due to a given radiative forcing.",Explained: Radiative forcing,true

Heat exchanges with the landscape bias trends in sea surface temperature (SST) measured close to shore such as at Cape Ferguson near Townsville (Latitude -19.2774o, Longitude 147.0586o), especially during periods of low summer rainfall when maximum temperature (Tmax) is axiomatically higher. Removing seasonal cycles, which show no trend, and accounting for the significant effect of terrestrial Tmax and barometric pressure (hPa), left no trend of change attributable to any other factor. While Tmax is clustered into dry-warm and moist-cool years, there is no evidence that SST has warmed since records commenced in September 1991.  #2. At Cape Ferguson SST cools more slowly from its peak in January to July than it warms from August to to December. Great Barrier Reef (GBR) ecosystems must therefore be adapted to the 8.1C interannual cycle and average month-to-month SST changes of up to 2C.  #3. Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) SST data is short, patchy, poorly dispersed towards the extremities of the Reef and not useful for estimating trend. Selecting day-of-year averages for 27 sites extending from Thursday Island Cape York to North Solitary Island in the south showed Reef ecosystems are adapted to average temperatures between 27C to greater than 29C and greater than 30C for four to five months, and less than 20C in winter (July to September). Highest average SST is predicted to be 29.64C ( ± PI 1.12oC) at Latitude ‑13.5o in late January; SST cools slightly towards the equator.  #4. The Southern Equatorial Current which splits to form the North Queensland current and the East Australian Current (which dissipates south into the Tasman Sea) is cooled continuously by convection, long-wave re-radiation to space by towering clouds, cool rainfall and the formation of reflective residual cirrus ice-clouds. These processes maintain SST within close limits that rarely and only transiently exceed 30oC.  #5. No difference was found between temperatures measured between Port Stephens and Cape Sidmouth in November and December 1871 and data for those times derived from AIMS datasets. Further, data does not support claims by AIMS, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, The Australian Museum, the Great Barrier Reef Foundation and groups including WWF and the Climate Council that sea surface temperature has increased by an unremarkable 0.8oC or that continued warming is likely to threaten survival of the Reef.  #6 Near the Equator the water cycle operates as a self-regulating heat-pump that catapults moisture high into the atmosphere to form cloud that reflects or rejects incoming solar energy during the monsoon and thereby limits input of warm waters to the North Queensland and East Australian currents. There is no evidence that the process has broken-down or is likely to break down in the future.  Background  With operations in Townsville, Darwin and Perth, AIMS is part of arguably the largest, most expensive and elite conglomerate of research institutions in Australia. Spread across multiple universities and state and commonwealth agencies and with strong support from the Australian Research Council, their research focuses on the effect of climate change on Australia’s Great Barrier Reef. They and partner organisations including CSIRO and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA), Great Barrier Reef Foundation, WWF and the Climate Council have consistently claimed survival of the Reef is imperiled by rising seas and anthropogenic warming. For instance, GBRMPA states unequivocally[2] that “Australia’s climate has warmed on average by 1.44 degrees Celsius since national records began in 1910, with most warming occurring since 1950 and every decade since then being warmer than the ones before”; and that “sea surface temperatures in the Australian region have warmed by around 1 degree Celsius since 1910, with the Great Barrier Reef warming by 0.8 degrees Celsius in the same period”.  Research reported here investigates that claim. The main question is:  Is mean SST increasing, and if so, at what rate.  What we did  Using average SST data from September 1991 for the fixed tide gauge at Cape Ferguson, which is part of the Australian baseline Sea Level Monitoring Project run by Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology (BoM), we aimed to distinguish between variables that caused variation IN SST from latent factors that may have impacted ON the data-stream (impact variables). Multiple linear regression (MLR) was used to investigate variation IN SST, while factors that impacted ON the data-stream were investigated using step-change analysis of MLR residuals (SST with covariable effects removed).  Commencing on 28 November 1871, SST was measured between Port Stephens and Cape Sidmouth near the top of Cape York by astronomers from Melbourne and Sydney who sailed on the Governor Blackall to observe the total eclipse of the sun and also on their return voyage commencing 13 December. They used bucket samples taken near the bow of the steamer each hour between 6 am and 6 pm each day. Data were summarised and coordinates were estimated from accompanying notes using Google Earth Pro. Although published in 1877, the data has never been used before to benchmark data collected more recently by AIMS. (National Library of Australia call number NL 551.56 R963.)  As AIMS data consisted of varying numbers of daily observations, collected using a variety of dataloggers and sensors over variable time periods, averages were calculated for 27 sites spanning the Reef corresponding to the time of the 1877 voyages and mainly at the start and middle of each calendar month. Datasets were analysed as transects using polynomial regression and compared statistically and graphically.  The Cape Ferguson, 1871 and derived AIMS SST datasets used in the study are available here .  Principal findings  Data measured close to shore was contaminated by heat transfers with the landscape. Thus, data for Cape Ferguson (and some AIMS dataloggers, notably several in Torres Strait) was warmer during dry hot summers and did not truly reflect SST.  The Eastern Australian Current warms rapidly from November to December and temperature measured on the journey to Cape Sidmouth in 1871 was significantly cooler than values for the return voyage to Port Stephens. However, despite spatial and temporal uncertainties and within and between year variation in the behavior of the currents, confidence bands for AIMS data averaged for 01 and 15 November overlapped those for the voyage north from Port Stephens and were therefore not different. Within the Latitude limits of where datasets overlap, AIMS data for 04 and 18 December, 01 January and 15 and 01 February, are also not different to data for the return voyage from 13 to 24 December 1871.  Furthermore, toward its northern extremity (Bramble Cay, Latitude ‑9.08o, for which there is no useful AIMS data), while SST increases steadily from 01 November to mid-December, from then until March, SST does not exceed between 29o and 30oC. The curvilinear response evidenced an upper-limit to SST, which is rarely or only briefly exceeded.  Average monthly SST attains a plateau in late November that persists until the cooling phase commences in March. SST in the range 27oC to 29oC from November to late March provides a five-month growing season for corals, which combined with the minimum of around 20oC in July (North Keppel Island) defines the ecotone limit of Reef ecosystems.  North Solitary Island is too cool from September to April (<24oC) for Reef ecosystems to establish and thrive. It was estimated that at Latitude -13.5o , which was the warmest point along the Reef transect, maximum SST occurred in late January to early February (29.64oC ± PI 1.12oC ), the minimum occurred in mid-August (24.26oC ± PI 1.47oC), SST increased to mid-November (27.96oC ± PI 1.1oC) after which the cycle repeats. The interannual range was therefore about 5.4oC. Despite trend in sea-surface temperature being touted as a threatening process that may ‘catastrophically’ impact on the long-term health and survival of the Reef, of the scores of sampling sites operated by AIMS, only several are dispersed towards the extremities of the Reef, while too few are sufficiently well maintained and serviced to provide reliable long-term data.  Sea surface temperatures reported by AIMS are no warmer than they were in November and December 150 years ago in 1871. As solar radiation increases in summer, SST north of Latitude -13.5o is cooled by the monsoon and remains in the range of 29oC to 30oC. AIMS SST data shows no evidence that the process has broken-down or is likely to break down in the future.  As SST has not changed, nor is it likely to change in the future, coral bleaching is due to something else.  The full Report is available here .

461,156767442211345646898723441924151360731,"In the 5 years since SoE 2011, the marine environment has experienced several climate extremes, including one of the strongest La Niña events on record, in 2010–12, and the strongest El Niño event since 1998, in 2015–16 (see Interannual and subdecadal variability for a detailed description of ENSO ). Variation in ocean temperatures and circulation associated with the La Niña event, superimposed on rising ocean temperatures associated with climate change, resulted in a marine heatwave (see Hobday et al. 2016 for a definition of such an event) off the Western Australian coast in 2011. The extended period of high ocean temperatures led to widespread bleaching of corals, loss of kelp forests, fish and invertebrate deaths, extensions and contractions in species distributions, variations in recruitment and growth rates, and impacts on trophic (food-chain) relationships and community structure. Cyclone Yasi, the strongest cyclone to make landfall in Queensland since at least 1918, also occurred during this La Niña period, causing widespread direct damage to central regions of the Great Barrier Reef, and resulting in high freshwater and sediment input into the coastal waters of the eastern seaboard because of associated widespread flooding (see also the Coasts report). The 2015–16 El Niño event, superimposed on an increasing baseline of ocean temperatures associated with climate change, resulted in the highest sea surface temperatures across the Great Barrier Reef on record. These extreme temperatures resulted in extensive coral bleaching and die-off, particularly across the northern regions. The conditions also caused a marine heatwave off the east coast of Tasmania from December 2015 to May 2016, the effects of which are yet to be determined.  There has been steady development in the National Representative System of Marine Protected Areas ( NRSMPA ) since 2011, especially in the Commonwealth marine area . In November 2012, 40 Commonwealth marine reserves (CMRs) were proclaimed in the South-west, North-west, North, Temperate East and Coral Sea marine regions, completing the NRSMPA in the Commonwealth marine area . The network was reproclaimed in December 2013, and the management plans for all regions except the South-east were set aside. The 10-year South-east Management Plan came into effect in 2013, with management under the Director of National Parks in accordance with the EPBC Act . A review of the new CMRs and how they were to be managed started in August 2014, and the associated reports were submitted to the Australian Government for consideration in December 2015. The review was released in August 2016, and revised management plans for each reserve are currently being developed by the Australian Government. New marine reserves declared across the states and the Northern Territory since January 2011 and reported in the 2014 Collaborative Australian Protected Area Database comprise reserves in the Northern Territory (675 square kilometres [km2]), Queensland (256 km2), Tasmania (31 km2) and Western Australia (10,055 km2). Management plans for South Australia’s marine reserve network were finalised in 2013.  In the fisheries sector, national assessment and reporting of key Australian fish stocks through a collaboration across all government fisheries agencies was initiated in 2012. This reporting framework provides, for the first time, national fishery-wide reporting. The aim is that, over time, the reports will consider other aspects of ecologically sustainable development, such as the effects of fishing on the marine environment, economic performance and governance. A second report was produced in 2014, expanding on the number of stocks assessed in 2012, and a third was released in December 2016. A national strategy for research, development and extension for fisheries and aquaculture (FRDC 2010) is in place under the broader National Primary Industries Research, Development and Extension Framework, which is a collaboration between Australian Government agencies, state and territory agencies, and key research providers. The Fisheries Research and Development Corporation Indigenous Reference Group released key research, development and extension principles in 2015. These were aimed at developing self-management structures for cultural fisheries and supporting sustainable development of traditional harvesting.  In the oil and gas sector, regulatory reform resulting from the commission of inquiry into the Montara oil spill led to the implementation of the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority ( NOPSEMA ) in 2012. Under the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006, NOPSEMA is responsible for national regulation of safety, oil well integrity, and environmental management of oil and gas operations in Australian waters and in coastal waters where powers have been conferred by the state or territory. With the implementation of NOPSEMA , there has been an increased level of scrutiny of offshore petroleum environmental management through assessment processes and compliance inspections. Investigation and enforcement powers for environmental management have also been strengthened, which has resulted in better understanding of the impacts of activities, greater focus on industry compliance and better preparedness for unplanned events.  Several significant changes to managing commercial vessels in Australian waters have been implemented since 2011 to increase environmental protection. These include:  designation of the Coral Sea Particularly Sensitive Sea Area  review of the National Plan for Maritime Environmental Emergencies  National Plan for Maritime Environmental Emergencies development of the North-East Shipping Management Plan.  The revised National Plan for Maritime Environmental Emergencies, released in 2014, provides a single national, comprehensive and integrated response arrangement for the management of maritime environmental emergencies. In particular, it details Australia’s implementation of provisions set out under the international conventions and agreements that Australia is party to with respect to management of maritime environmental emergencies. In addition, vessel routing measures have been implemented off Ningaloo Reef, the southern Great Barrier Reef and south-western Western Australia. The Great Barrier Reef and Torres Strait vessel traffic service has also been extended.  The Intergovernmental Agreement on Biosecurity (IGAB)—an agreement between the Australian and all state and territory governments, except Tasmania—came into effect in 2012. It aims to strengthen the working partnership between governments; improve the national biosecurity system; and minimise the impact of pests and diseases on Australia’s economy, environment and the community. The marine sector applies the biosecurity principles and framework of the IGAB through a suite of measures, including management of international and domestic ballast water and biofouling.  The deteriorating condition of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area, and concerns raised by a monitoring mission by the World Heritage Centre and the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) triggered an assessment of this World Heritage property by the Australian and Queensland governments in 2014. As a result of this assessment, the Reef 2050 Long-term Sustainability Plan was developed, which aims to include all levels of government, the community, traditional owners, industry and the scientific community in the management of external pressures affecting the Reef. In association with the plan, a Reef-wide integrated monitoring and reporting program is currently being developed to measure the success of the sustainability plan and support adaptive management of the World Heritage Area.  A number of strategies focusing on conservation, biodiversity protection and sustainable development of Australia’s environment have also been released since 2011, including Australia’s Biodiversity Conservation Strategy 2010–2030, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority’s Science strategy and information needs 2014–2019 and the National Marine Science Plan 2015–2025. Each of these provides frameworks for coordinating research input to manage the marine environment.  At the same time, however, several formal frameworks facilitating national coordination between the Australian Government and the states and territories on marine science strategy and investment have been abandoned. These include the National Oceans Advisory Group, and the Marine and Coastal Committee of the Natural Resource Management Ministerial Council and its supporting National Marine Protected Area Working Group.  Government reviews and inquiries relating to the marine environment conducted during the past 5 years include:",Australia State of the Environment Report,true

The governor said the recruitment of more personnel into the armed forces is paramount.  Speaking on Tuesday in Ibadan, Oyo state capital, the governor proffered solutions to the security challenges in the country.  “There are two things that we need to address quickly to bring the current wave of insecurity to a halt,” he said.

Advertisement  “The ungoverned spaces need to be closed up quickly by motivated men with the singular objective to save the nation.  “That takes us to the number two issue of financing and arming large recruitment.”  Fayemi said a cost-effective and quick way to achieve the recruitment drive is to reform the National Youths Service Corps (NYSC) and encourage “willing” corps members to join military services.  He said: “With this, we can use the existing orientation camps to train willing and able graduates to reflate the security personnel under a special arrangement that will be worked out.  “That way, the fund that is currently deployed to the NYSC can be used with just some additional funding, which could be sourced through a national emergency fund for the next five to 10 years.  “Those who cannot join the military services can serve in their community without pay if we must still retain the NYSC for everyone.  “To incentivise those who may volunteer to serve, they will have a separate certificate and medal of honour in addition to having priority for military, paramilitary and civil or public service recruitment after service.”  Commenting on divisive comments, the governor called on the political class “to fashion out a new way of communicating their politics beyond the now obnoxious resort to ethnic jingoism, sectarian and divisive rhetoric”.

466,323498984092816741377831328790613693767,"This was the eye-catching claim made in a recent story in The Times, which asserted that ‘[a] third of Londoners are completely unvaccinated’. With case rates in the capital shooting through the roof and hospital admissions threatening to follow suit as the Omicron variant arrives in town with a vengeance, this sounds like a pretty alarming state of affairs. Indeed, with the emerging evidence suggesting that even two doses of vaccine provide only limited protection and a booster vaccination is required to restore high levels of immunity against Omicron, these seem like worrying times to be in London.  But can this claim really be true? Superficially it appears to be – the figures are taken from the government’s generally excellent Covid-19 dashboard. In fact, you could argue on the basis of the dashboard data that a third is an understatement as this figure reflects the vaccination rate in people ages 12+ only. There are around 1.4 million under 12s in London, which would bring the proportion of people in London who have not had a single vaccination up to 41%. Yet, all is not as it seems…  When it comes to calculating a vaccination rate, we need to know both the number of people we have vaccinated and the total number of people in the population. Counting the number of vaccinated people is easy – we already know how many vaccine doses we’ve given out and how many of those were 1st, 2nd or 3rd / booster doses. But knowing how many people there are in London is, it turns out, surprisingly difficult.  The vaccination rollout has been coordinated using health care records – something called the National Immunisation Management System, or NIMS, to be precise. This is the same system that the NHS uses to send invitations for seasonal flu vaccinations. NIMS gets its data from primary care records – your local GP surgery. This seems like a pretty good way to count people – almost everyone is registered with a doctor after all. However, it turns out there are some serious issues with this data.  Often when people move to a new area and register with a new GP, they don’t get removed from the records of their old one, and so appear twice in the data. Similarly, when people pass away, or leave the country entirely, they aren’t always removed from the system. With the combined effects of Brexit and then Covid-19, we’ve seen a lot of emigration from London in particular, and much higher than usual mortality rates. The upshot of this is that NIMS almost certainly overstates the number of people in the capital.  To get a sense of just how big this overstatement might be, we can look to alternative estimates of our population. The latest of these comes from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and represents their best estimates of the population in mid-2020. These numbers are themselves imperfect, being based on 2011 census data and explicitly not accounting for the mortality impacts of the pandemic, but the difference is remarkable.  NIMS says that there are 9.2 million people aged 12+ in London while the ONS estimate is 7.6 million. That’s a staggering 1.6 million people in London who may or may not actually exist. Since we can’t vaccinate people who don’t exist (for fairly obvious reasons), our choice of population estimate has a huge impact on our estimate of the number of unvaccinated Londoners. Moving from NIMS to ONS increases our estimate of 1st dose coverage in London from 68% to 82%.  A second notable thing about this graph is that the difference between the two estimates is so much bigger for London than other parts of the country. This is in large part because the differences between NIMS and ONS estimates are highest in younger adults, and London has a much younger population than the rest of England. Higher rates of rental, rather than home ownership in London than the rest of England are also likely to contribute to Londoners moving more frequently, increasing the chances they appear in NIMS more than once.  So we have these two, very different figures, but which is right? The answer is that they are both definitely wrong to some extent. NIMS will overstate the number of young people, while ONS doesn’t account for the high death toll in older age groups during the pandemic, so is likely to overstate the number of people in those age groups who are alive today. And both sources are unlikely to fully capture the extent to which former London residents have left the capital or even the country in the past two years. But, there is clear agreement from experts like David Spiegelhalter that ONS figures are more appropriate when looking at vaccine coverage. Indeed, NHS England use ONS estimates for their national and regional vaccination coverage data and the government dashboard uses it for their national figures, but NIMS for their regional numbers.  The huge sensitivity of our overall estimates of vaccine coverage to this choice is a big challenge, particularly for London, and it’s something that doesn’t just affect our estimates of how many unvaccinated people, but also 2nd doses and booster coverage.  There are valid arguments for the use of NIMS (like here) but when our best estimate is that less than one in five Londoners aged 12+ have yet to have any vaccinations, publishing figures from trusted sources that say the true number is one in three is only likely to lead to confusion. This problem is all the more acute because precisely this same issue was what led to recent controversy about Covid-19 case rates in vaccinated vs. unvaccinated groups that led to the UK statistics regulator publicly criticising UKHSA.  In the longer term, hopefully we can work towards reducing the gaps between different population estimates (something the 2021 census will certainly help with), but until then those of us working to communicate Covid-19 data to the public need to do a better job of highlighting these uncertainties and their implications.

467,162163380081547921405937663713286753812,"Nickaylah Sampson seemed well on her way to achieving her dream of becoming an officer in the U.S. Army.  A stellar student whose family has a long tradition of military service, the San Antonio native earned a coveted spot at West Point.  She completed her freshman year in the spring of 2021, just as the military launched its vaccination campaign against COVID-19. Though she had no problem with the nine other vaccines the U.S. military requires upon enlistment, she said she worried that the COVID-19 shots were too new for their risks to be fully understood.  She said her parents, both Army veterans, told her she had only one option: “Get out as quickly as you can.”  Nickaylah Sampson, 19, resigned as a West Point cadet in October 2021 over the military’s vaccine mandate. (Nickaylah Sampson)  Advertisement  So in October, Sampson, 19, quit West Point.  The latest data from the military show that roughly 30,000 active-duty service members remain unvaccinated against COVID-19, despite a Defense Department mandate issued in August and deadlines that have passed.  Their defiance of a military order is a striking illustration of how deeply politicized the pandemic has become in the United States.  “Racism, suicide, addiction to conspiracy theories — you name it. If you can find it in the civilian population, you can find it within the military,” said Peter Feaver, a political scientist at Duke University who specializes in civil-military relations. “The difference is that the military has a wider range of tools to include more day-to-day control over the lives of its members ... to monitor and manage these problems.”  That helps explain why the vast majority of service members — more than 97% of active-duty forces — have received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine.  The rest have sided with the anti-vaccination movement, which is built on conspiracy theories about the pandemic and the vaccines, as well as the libertarian principle against government mandates of any kind.  Marines line up to receive the Moderna vaccine at Camp Hansen in Okinawa, Japan, on April 28, 2021.

The holdouts also include officers and service members who are close to retirement and run the risk of losing their pensions.  Brig. Gen. Thomas Mancino, commanding officer for the Oklahoma National Guard, told his troops last month that he was rejecting the Defense Department’s mandate and would instead be following orders from the state’s Republican governor, Kevin Stitt.  Last week, a federal judge rejected a lawsuit filed by Stitt and the state attorney general challenging the mandate.  In a separate case, a federal judge in Texas issued a preliminary injunction Monday blocking the Navy from enforcing the mandate for 26 SEALs and nine special operations crew members.  The service members had argued in court that the mandate violated their religious freedom because “aborted fetal cell lines” were used in the development of the vaccine, making it an “affront to the Creator.”  A soldier receives a COVID-19 vaccine Sept. 9, 2021, at Ft. Knox in Kentucky. (Jon Cherry / Washington Post)  Laboratory-grown fetal cell lines — obtained from a few abortions decades ago — are used in the production of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and helped in the development of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, though none of the vaccines contain such cells. The same fetal cell lines have also been used in the development of ibuprofen and aspirin.  The lawsuit is backed by 47 Republican members of Congress who filed an amicus brief defending the “religious liberty” of the plaintiffs.  U.S. Navy SEALS v. Joseph R. Biden A request for a preliminary injunction against the Department of Defense’s COVID vaccine mandate from 35 Navy SEALS.  It’s not the first time vaccination has been an issue in the military. In 1998, when the Pentagon mandated the anthrax vaccine, which the Food and Drug Administration approved in the 1970s, some service members openly worried about possible side effects and resisted. A handful quit.  But for the most part, medical directives have not been seriously challenged.  Lori Hogue, who served as a combat medic in the Army in the 1980s, said she remembers when soldiers were suddenly ordered to receive flu shots.  “We all knew what we had to do,” she said. “When you raise your right hand, you agree to all that stuff. You don’t have a lot of rights in the military. They tell you what to do.”  Hogue said she and her husband, a Vietnam veteran, have come to the conclusion that the military has become more politicized, starting at the top.  “How many senior people, say in the Pentagon, are anti-vaxxers or hold that political opinion?” she said. “It’s coming from the political climate outside the military and it’s leaking in.”  In March, as Americans across the country were lining up for their shots, the Department of Defense pledged to make the vaccines available to all military personnel by mid-July. At that point, the FDA had approved the shots under an emergency-use authorization, and the military was not requiring them.  But some service members said officers were already pressuring them to get vaccinated. Sampson said she and 34 other unvaccinated cadets were segregated from the rest of their class during training, barred from sports and subjected to briefings aimed at convincing them the vaccines were safe.  In June, her father, Mathias Sampson, appeared on Fox’s “Sean Hannity Show” to defend his daughter’s position.  “My daughter has valid concerns about this vaccination — concerns pertaining to fertility, long-term effects,” the retired lieutenant colonel told the conservative host. “Neither the CDC nor West Point have answers to these concerns.”  The Defense Department mandate came a day after the FDA granted full approval for the Pfizer vaccine. Service members at bases around the country began lining up at clinics and in gymnasiums for their shots.  But it wasn’t long before anonymous military-themed social media accounts began popping up and spreading misinformation about the vaccines.  One Twitter user who claims to be an active-duty chief warrant officer and has more than 2,000 followers — many of them servicemen or veterans — wrote that the COVID shot “has killed many kids” and that a pharmacy on a military base in Washington was swapping out flu shots for COVID shots without telling people.  In addition to the lawsuit by the Navy SEALs, 16 other service members have sued the Defense Department, the FDA and the heads of every military branch, arguing that the mandates are unlawful.  Coker V. Austin Lawsuit The Coker V. Austin lawsuit filed by 16 service members who sued to stop the U.S. Department of Defense’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate.  Among the plaintiffs is Brian Stermer, a sergeant first class in the Army Reserves who said he distrusts the government’s claims that the vaccines are safe and effective.  “It’s a new technology and there’s a nefariousness behind it,” he said. “And the whole shot in every arm — I don’t trust them.”  Stermer, who lives on the Ft. Leonard Wood military base in Missouri, said he considered applying for a medical exemption but realized that as a healthy 33-year-old he stood little chance.  Like many service members refusing to get vaccinated, he is seeking a religious accommodation, arguing that the mandate goes against Scripture.  His chances of being granted one are next to none. The various branches of the military have received a total of more than 12,000 such requests and after reviewing thousands have yet to approve a single one.  Permanent medical exemptions are also rare — the Army has approved just four. Some service members have temporary exemptions for medical or logistical reasons.  As for what will happen to the unvaccinated service members, the military is still figuring it out.  The National Defense Authorization Act that President Biden signed Dec. 27 says that “any discharge of a service member on the sole basis that the member failed to obey a lawful order to receive a vaccine for COVID-19 shall be an honorable discharge, or a general discharge under honorable conditions.”  The Marine Corps said last month that it kicked out 169 troops for defying the vaccine mandate and that all unvaccinated Marines without a pending or approved exemption or appeal “will be processed for administrative separation.”  Capt. Andrew Wood, a spokesman for the Marine Corps, said that the separations were being handled on a case-by-case basis.  Lt. Col. Terry Kelley, a spokesman for the Army, said that 2,767 soldiers have received “general officer written reprimands” — killing their opportunities for promotions or transfers within the military — and that two battalion commanders as well as four other officers have been relieved of their duties but remain enlisted in the military.  “We need our soldiers to be ready to fight and win, and if this virus is spreading through our ranks, that would obviously have an impact on our readiness,” he said.  Kelley said that the military could not discuss individual cases.  Sampson, who said she received an honorable discharge, wasn’t the only cadet at West Point to give up on a military career because of the vaccine mandate.  Cadet Hannah MacDonald, 19, resigned from West Point in October 2021 over the military’s vaccine mandate. (Hannah MacDonald)  Her friend Hannah MacDonald, who left West Point around the same time, provided The Times with a photograph of her honorable discharge certificate. The two had grown close after the academy began segregating the unvaccinated and they were assigned to the same isolation cabin.  “I really want to be a soldier,” said MacDonald, 19, who grew up in Boston. “I wanted to be able to deploy. I want to be able to fight, and I felt like if I took this vaccine, I would not be commissionable or deployable. I didn’t think it was safe for my health.”  In early November, the two women and a former classmate who also dropped out appeared on Hannity’s show to explain their decisions.  “I truly did feel like it was my calling to be an officer, mostly because my father himself was an Army officer,” Sampson said on the show. “I felt obligated to follow in his footsteps. But when I got there, it didn’t turn out like I thought it would or like I planned.”  MacDonald said that she’s planning on filing a lawsuit against West Point.  A few days after their appearance on “Hannity,” both women received emails from Hillsdale College, a Christian liberal arts college in southern Michigan, offering them admission.  MacDonald said that she decided to take some time off from school to be with her parents to figure out what to do next — and that the college’s offer still stands.  Sampson said she plans to enroll at Hillsdale in the spring and major in mathematics.",How politicized has vaccination become? Thousands of U.S. troops are disobeying orders that they get shots,true
468,182242461509834261137362438601071045068,"I wholeheartedly share the concerns of constituents about the use of storm overflows and, as a passionate conservationist, need no convincing as to the importance of ensuring clean and healthy rivers. That is why I have for some time been leading the campaign to tackle the use of storm overflows.  We have made significant progress this year in particular, and I will explain more about this shortly. However, I will begin by commenting on Lords’ Amendment 45 to the Environment Bill, which was voted on last night, and about which a number of constituents have contacted me.  The Government has inserted a range of amendments to the Environment Bill to address the concerns I and other colleagues have raised about the use of storm overflows. I was pleased to vote in support of Amendment (a) to Lords Amendment 45, which passed by a margin of 265 votes for to 202 votes against.  Concerns have been raised that section 141A, tabled by the Duke of Wellington in the House of Lords, was removed from Amendment 45. Section 141A sought to place a new duty on sewerage undertakers in England and Wales to demonstrate progressive reductions in the harm caused by discharges of untreated sewage.  This all sounds admirable, and indeed is something I support in principle. But the trouble is that the Duke’s amendment came with no plan as to how this can be delivered and no impact assessment whatsoever.  Some might argue that a plan is not essential, that one can be formulated afterwards. I would be sympathetic to this point of view if we were talking about a simple, inexpensive endeavour. But in eliminating storm overflows, we are talking about transforming a system which has operated since the Victorian Era, the preliminary cost of which is estimated to be anywhere between £150 billion and £650 billion.  To put those figures in perspective, £150 billion is more than the entire schools, policing and defence budgets put together, and £650 billion is well above what has been spent combatting the Coronavirus pandemic.  The Government’s view was that it would have been irresponsible to have inserted this section in the Bill given that it was not backed by a detailed plan and thorough impact assessment. It would have been the equivalent of signing a blank check on behalf of billpayers.  However, I was pleased to support of the other amendments to the Environment Bill relating to storm overflows (including the rest of Amendment 45).  One of these amendments places a legal duty on government to publish a plan by 1 September next year to reduce sewage discharges from storm overflows. A separate amendment will also place a duty on government to publish a report on the ‘mechanics’ of eliminating overflows entirely (also due before 1 September next year).  This is absolutely essential, as it will provide Parliament and the public with up-front, clear and comprehensive information on the cost and impact of eliminating storm overflows. Between the Government plan on storm overflows and the new elimination report, we will fully understand precisely how we can best tackle storm overflows.  So while setting out lofty aspirations is all well and good, what we really need to do is the long, detailed, practical work required to understand how we can deliver on these ambitions. It is not glamorous or headline-grabbing. But it is the effective action we need to deliver for local residents.  Please do not think that the Environment Bill only legislates for the production of plans on tackling storm overflows, however vital these no doubt are. I was pleased to support amendments to the Bill which take firm and immediate action to tackle storm overflows in the short-term. This includes:  A new duty on water companies and the Environment Agency to publish data on storm overflow operation on an annual basis.    A new duty on water companies to publish near real time information (within 1 hour) of the commencement of an overflow, its location and when it ceases.    A new duty on water companies to continuously monitor the water quality upstream and downstream of a storm overflow and of sewage disposal works.    A new duty on water companies to produce comprehensive statutory Drainage and Sewerage Management Plans setting out how the company will manage and develop its networks, and how storm overflows will be addressed through these plans.  Outside of the Bill, Ministers have made their expectations crystal clear in DEFRA’s draft Strategic Policy Statement to Ofwat. For the first time, the Government will be telling the industry’s financial regulator that it expects water companies to take steps to “significantly reduce storm overflows”, and that it expects funding to be approved for them to do so.  Ministers will also undertake a review of legislation which would require Sustainable Drainage Systems to be constructed to ministerial standards on new developments, reducing the pressure on the sewage system.  All of these measures are informed by the work of the Storm Overflows Task Force, which Defra established in August 2020 to bring together key stakeholders from the water industry, environmental NGOs, regulators, and Government in order to drive progress in reducing sewage discharges. The Taskforce has agreed a goal to eliminate harm from storm overflows.  I hope this information is helpful and reassures readers that any suggestion that MPs are not taking firm action on storm overflows is false. Last night Parliament voted in favour of taking a range of immediate steps to address storm overflows, together with a legal duty on government to produce detailed and costed plans for reducing and eliminating storm overflows entirely.  Locally, I will continue to pressure Thames Water to deliver the urgent infrastructure upgrades which are required in West Oxfordshire, including the vital expansion of Witney Sewage Treatment Works. Last month I held a Water Action Day, taking leading figures at Thames Water on a tour of West Oxfordshire so they could see first-hand the problems we are experiencing and to demand urgent action. Please be assured that I will continue to drive progress until we can all enjoy clean and healthy waterways.

469,175682727938577327570026444780978361616,"January 2022 was the sunniest start to a year on record for England, and the third sunniest for the UK in provisional figures released by the Met Office.  England saw an average 80.7 hours of sunshine in January, putting it at the top of a series that dates back to 1919. The UK saw an average of 62.7 hours of sunshine in the month, which makes it the sunniest January since 2001 and the third sunniest overall.  Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland also had above average sunshine hours in the month, although not enough to trouble any records. Wales had an average of 55.1 hours of sunshine (17% above average), Scotland 38.1 hours (8% above average) and Northern Ireland 43.4 hours (2% above average). Northern Scotland was the notable exception with a relatively dull month and just 76% of average sunshine.  Sunshine amounts were especially high in northern and eastern England, with a number of regions seeing record-high levels of sunshine in the month, including North Yorkshire (88.6 hours), Derbyshire (80.3 hours) and Nottinghamshire (105.4 hours). For Nottinghamshire, the final figure for sunshine hours was a massive 79% more than their long-term average for the month, and Norfolk exceeded its average sunshine total by 92%.  East Anglia and the Midlands also saw record levels of sunshine in the month, with East Anglia’s figure of 101.8 hours of sunshine topping the previous record of 85.5 hours set in 2001. For the Midlands, 78.4 sunshine hours topped the 74.3 hours seen in 1952.  Sunshine hours in January 2022 against the long term average  A mild theme  January started with the warmest New Year’s Day on record for the UK, with 16.3°C recorded at St James’s Park in London. Scotland and Wales also broke their New Year’s Day record high temperatures, as 15.9°C was reported at Achnagart (Scotland) and 15.6°C at Hawarden (Wales).  The mild theme continued for much of the month, albeit with some cool nighttime temperatures in the south for much of the month.  It was an especially mild January for Scotland, with a mean temperature of 4.7°C putting it as the country’s sixth warmest January on record and 1.8°C above the long-term average.  Mean temperature for January 2022 versus the long term average  Mild conditions were not quite as dominant further south, low levels of cloud resulted in some spells of low overnight minimum temperatures being reported along with more ground frost and air frost compared to further north. For only the third time in 30 years, England saw more air frosts in January than Scotland, with an average of 12 days of air frost topping the 8 days seen in Scotland. Wales reported an average of 11 days and Northern Ireland 5 days.  Air frosts for January 2022 against the long term average  Dry for most  Despite a late-month flurry of rain in the north, January has seen less than half the average rainfall for the month for the UK. An average of 61.3mm of rain fell, which is well below the average of 121.5mm. Scotland was the only country to report more than 50% of its average rainfall, but its figure of 110.2mm was still only 62% of its average.  England had its ninth driest January in a series that goes back to 1862, with just 38% (31.7mm) of its average rainfall. Wales had 44% (68.9mm) of its average, and Northern Ireland 47% (53.4mm).  Rainfall amount for January 2022 versus the long term average  Dr Mark McCarthy of the National Climate Information Centre said, “January has been a dry and sunny month. It has been notably mild for Scotland but a fair share of frosty mornings across much of England.  “High pressure has had a big influence over the UK’s weather this month, with a persistent area of high pressure in the south dominating the picture from mid-month and resulting in a relatively dry month. The exception to this for the UK was the late influence of Storms Malik and Corrie in the last weekend of January, bringing rain and disruptive winds to many in the north.”  Indeed, this is reflected in mean wind speeds which have been generally above average in the north of Scotland in January, but relatively calm across much of England and Wales.

Despite January’s noteworthy sunshine, December’s contrasting dullness – the dullest since 1956 and the sixth dullest calendar month in records back to 1919 – means that winter so far has still been slightly duller than average, with 87.7 hours of sunshine so far, which is 54% of the average for the whole of the season.

471,94216591127937230811006366293938298446,"Earth's atmosphere stretches out to the Moon – and beyond  20 February 2019  A recent discovery based on observations by the ESA/NASA Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, SOHO, shows that the gaseous layer that wraps around Earth reaches up to 630 000 km away, or 50 times the diameter of our planet.  ""The Moon flies through Earth's atmosphere,"" says Igor Baliukin of Russia's Space Research Institute, lead author of the paper presenting the results.  ""We were not aware of it until we dusted off observations made over two decades ago by the SOHO spacecraft.""  Where our atmosphere merges into outer space, there is a cloud of hydrogen atoms called the geocorona. One of the spacecraft instruments, SWAN, used its sensitive sensors to trace the hydrogen signature and precisely detect how far the very outskirts of the geocorona are.  These observations could be done only at certain times of the year, when the Earth and its geocorona came into view for SWAN.  For planets with hydrogen in their exospheres, water vapour is often seen closer to their surface. That is the case for Earth, Mars and Venus.  ""This is especially interesting when looking for planets with potential reservoirs of water beyond our Solar System,"" explains Jean-Loup Bertaux, co-author and former principal investigator of SWAN.  The first telescope on the Moon, placed by Apollo 16 astronauts in 1972, captured an evocative image of the geocorona surrounding Earth and glowing brightly in ultraviolet light.  ""At that time, the astronauts on the lunar surface did not know that they were actually embedded in the outskirts of the geocorona,"" says Jean-Loup.  Cloud of hydrogen  The Sun interacts with hydrogen atoms through a particular wavelength of ultraviolet light called Lyman-alpha, which the atoms can both absorb and emit. Since this type of light is absorbed by Earth's atmosphere, it can only be observed from space.  Thanks to its hydrogen absorption cell, the SWAN instrument could selectively measure the Lyman-alpha light from the geocorona and discard hydrogen atoms further out in interplanetary space.  The new study revealed that sunlight compresses hydrogen atoms in the geocorona on Earth's dayside, and also produces a region of enhanced density on the night side. The denser dayside region of hydrogen is still rather sparse, with just 70 atoms per cubic centimeter at 60 000 kilometers above Earth's surface, and about 0.2 atoms at the Moon's distance.  ""On Earth we would call it vacuum, so this extra source of hydrogen is not significant enough to facilitate space exploration,"" says Igor.  The good news is that these particles do not pose any threat for space travelers on future crewed missions orbiting the Moon.  ""There is also ultraviolet radiation associated to the geocorona, as the hydrogen atoms scatter sunlight in all directions, but the impact on astronauts in lunar orbit would be negligible compared to the main source of radiation – the Sun,"" says Jean-Loup Bertaux.  On the down side, the Earth's geocorona could interfere with future astronomical observations performed in the vicinity of the Moon.  ""Space telescopes observing the sky in ultraviolet wavelengths to study the chemical composition of stars and galaxies would need to take this into account,"" adds Jean-Loup.  The power of archives  Launched in December 1995, the SOHO space observatory has been studying the Sun, from its deep core to the outer corona and the solar wind, for over two decades. The satellite orbits around the first Lagrange point (L1), some 1.5 million kilometres from Earth towards the Sun.  This location is a good vantage point to observe the geocorona from outside. SOHO's SWAN instrument imaged Earth and its extended atmosphere on three occasions between 1996 and 1998.  Jean-Loup and Igor's research team in Russia decided to retrieve this data set from the archives for further analysis. These unique views of the whole geocorona as seen from SOHO are now shedding new light on Earth's atmosphere.  ""Data archived many years ago can often be exploited for new science,"" says Bernhard Fleck, ESA SOHO project scientist. ""This discovery highlights the value of data collected over 20 years ago and the exceptional performance of SOHO.""

472,257582007347413851595881180649390966027,"The UK will block visas for visitors from countries the home secretary believes are refusing to cooperate in taking back rejected asylum seekers or offenders.  In proposed legislation published on Tuesday, Priti Patel and future home secretaries would have the power to suspend or delay the processing of applications from countries that do no “cooperate with the UK government in relation to the removal from the United Kingdom of nationals of that country who require leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom but do not have it”.  The clause in the nationality and borders bill also allows for the home secretary to impose additional financial requirements for visa applications – that is, an increase in fees – if countries do not cooperate.  The proposals mirror US legislation that allows officials to withdraw visa routes from countries that refuse to take back undocumented migrants. It is understood that countries such as Iraq, Iran, Eritrea and Sudan are reluctant to cooperate with the UK on such matters.  The change is one of many in the bill, described as “the biggest overhaul of the UK’s asylum system in decades” by Patel, which includes measures such as:  Asylum seekers deemed to have arrived in the UK illegally will no longer have the same entitlements as those who arrive in the country via legal routes. Even if their claim is successful, they will be granted temporary refugee status and face the prospect of being indefinitely liable for removal.  Asylum seekers will be able to be removed from the UK while their asylum claim or appeal is pending, which opens the door to offshore asylum processing.  For those deemed to have arrived illegally, access to benefits and family reunion rights could be limited.  The appeals and judicial process will be changed to speed up the removal of those whose claims are refused.  The home secretary will be able to offer protection to vulnerable people in “immediate danger and at risk in their home country” in exceptional circumstances. It is thought this will be used to help a small number of people.  The system will be made “much harder for people to be granted refugee status based on unsubstantiated claims” and will include “rigorous age assessments” to stop adults pretending to be children. The government is considering the use of bone scanners to determine age.  Life sentences will be brought in as a maximum penalty for people-smugglers.  Foreign criminals who breach deportation orders and return to the UK could be jailed for up to five years instead of the current six months.  A new one-stop legal process is proposed so that asylum, human rights claims and any other protection matters are made and considered together before appeal hearings.  Campaigners have dubbed the proposed legislation the “anti-refugee bill”, claiming it will penalise those who need help the most.  Analysis of Home Office data by the Refugee Council suggests 9,000 people who would be accepted as refugees under current rules – those confirmed to have fled war or persecution following official checks – may no longer be given safety in the UK due to their means of arrival under the changes.  The charity’s chief executive, Enver Solomon, said that for decades people had taken “extraordinary measures to flee oppression”, but had gone on to become “law-abiding citizens playing by the rules and paying their taxes as proud Britons”.  Steve Valdez-Symonds, refugee and migrants rights programme director at Amnesty International UK, branded the bill “legislative vandalism”, claimed it could “fatally undermine the right to asylum” and accused Patel of a “shameful dereliction of duty”, adding: “This reckless and deeply unjust bill is set to bring shame on Britain’s international reputation.”  Sonya Sceats, chief executive of Freedom from Torture, described the plans as “dripping with cruelty” and an “affront to the caring people in this country who want a kinder, fairer approach to refugees”.  More than 250 organisations – including the Refugee Council, the British Red Cross, Freedom from Torture, Refugee Action and Asylum Matters – have joined to form the coalition Together with Refugees to call for a more effective, fair and humane approach to asylum in the UK.",UK to block visas for countries refusing to take back asylum seekers,true

These are the findings of a study of COVID-19 transmission between household contacts, led by Imperial College London and the UK Health Security Agency (HSA) and published today in The Lancet Infectious Diseases.  It finds that people who have received two doses of vaccine have a lower, but still appreciable, risk of becoming infected with the delta variant in the home compared with people who are unvaccinated. The authors stress that vaccination also reduces the risk of severe illness, hospitalisation and death from COVID-19.  The ongoing transmission we are seeing... makes it essential for unvaccinated people to get vaccinated to protect themselves from acquiring infection and severe COVID-19. Professor Ajit Lalvani NHLI  The analysis found that around 25% of vaccinated household contacts tested positive for COVID-19 compared with roughly 38% of unvaccinated household contacts.  Fully vaccinated people cleared the infection more quickly than those who are unvaccinated, but their peak viral load – the greatest amount of SARS-CoV-2 virus found in their nose and throat – was similar to that seen in unvaccinated people, which may explain why they can still readily pass on the virus in household settings.  According to the researchers, the study is one of few to date conducted using detailed data from households and offers crucial insights into how vaccinated people can still be infected with the delta variant and pass it to others.  Despite transmission between vaccinated people being possible, the researchers say it is essential for people who are unvaccinated, and those who are now eligible for boosters, to get vaccinated against COVID-19 to protect themselves from severe disease and hospitalisation.  “Vaccines are critical to controlling the pandemic, as we know they are fantastic at preventing serious illness and death from COVID-19,” said Professor Ajit Lalvani, of the National Heart & Lung Institute at Imperial College London, who co-led the study.  “Our findings show that vaccination alone is not enough to prevent people from being infected with the delta variant, and from spreading it onwards, in household settings. This is likely to be the case for other indoor settings where people spend extended periods of time in close proximity as will occur increasingly as we head into winter.”  Researchers found that fully vaccinated people cleared the infection more quickly than those who are unvaccinated, but their peak viral load – the greatest amount of SARS-CoV-2 virus found in their nose and throat – was similar to that seen in unvaccinated people, which may explain why they can still readily pass on the virus in household settings. (Credit: NIAID / Flickr)  Household COVID-19 spread  In the study, carried out by the NIHR Health Protection Research Unit in Respiratory Infections at Imperial, researchers enrolled 621 participants, identified by the UK contact tracing system, between September 2020 and September 2021 – before vaccine boosters had become widely available in the UK.  All participants had mild COVID-19 illness or were asymptomatic (showing no symptoms), and took swabs from their nose and throat each day for 14-20 days.  Of the 621 participants, 163 tested positive for COVID-19. Whole genome sequencing confirmed that 71 were infected with the delta variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, 42 had alpha and 50 had the original strain of SARS-CoV-2. Of the 71 participants infected with delta, 23 (32%) were unvaccinated, 10 (14%) received one vaccine dose and 38 (54%) had received two vaccine doses.  Continued public health and social measures to curb transmission thus remain important, even in vaccinated individuals. Dr Anika Singanayagam Department of Infectious Disease  A total of 205 household contacts of delta variant index cases were identified, of which 53 tested positive for COVID-19. Of the 205 contacts, 126 (62%) had received two vaccine doses, 39 (19%) had received one vaccine dose, and 40 (19%) were unvaccinated.  Among household contacts who had received two vaccine doses, 25% (31/126 contacts) became infected with the delta variant compared with 38% (15/40) of unvaccinated household contacts.  Among vaccinated contacts infected with the delta variant, the median length of time since vaccination was 101 days, compared with 64 days for uninfected contacts. This suggests that the risk of infection increased within 3 months of receiving a second vaccine dose, due to waning protective immunity. The authors point to this finding as important evidence of the need for vaccinated people to get a booster shot as soon as they are eligible for one.  Peak viral load  PCR tests on participants’ swab samples were used to detect changes in the amount of virus in a person’s nose and throat (viral load) over time.  A total of 133 participants had their daily viral load trajectories analysed, of whom 49 had pre-alpha and were unvaccinated, 39 had alpha and were unvaccinated, 29 had delta and were fully vaccinated, and 16 had delta and were unvaccinated.  The analysis found that viral load declined most rapidly among vaccinated people infected with the delta variant compared with unvaccinated people with delta, alpha, or pre-alpha.  However, the peak levels of virus in vaccinated people were similar to those in unvaccinated people. The researchers believe this may explain why the delta variant is still able to spread despite vaccination.  Dr Anika Singanayagam, first author of the study and Honorary Clinical Research Fellow within the Department of Infectious Disease at Imperial, said: “Understanding the extent to which vaccinated people can pass on the delta variant to others is a public health priority. By carrying out repeated and frequent sampling from contacts of COVID-19 cases, we found that vaccinated people can contract and pass on infection within households, including to vaccinated household members.  “Our findings provide important insights into the effect of vaccination in the face of new variants, and specifically, why the delta variant is continuing to cause high COVID-19 case numbers around the world, even in countries with high vaccination rates. Continued public health and social measures to curb transmission thus remain important, even in vaccinated individuals”  Professor Ajit Lalvani added: “The ongoing transmission we are seeing between vaccinated people makes it essential for unvaccinated people to get vaccinated to protect themselves from acquiring infection and severe COVID-19. We found that susceptibility to infection increased already within a few months after the second vaccine dose - so those offered a booster should get it promptly.”  The work was carried out through one of several Health Protection Research Unit’s (HPRU) at Imperial College London. Funded by the NIHR, these units are collaborations between Universities, the UK Health Security Agency (UK-HSA) and other partner organisations and aim to provide centres of excellence in multi-disciplinary health protection research.  The research was carried out in response to the surges of alpha and then the delta infections seen in the UK. The researchers say the work is an exemplar of a research intensive university partnering with the national public health agency to deliver important policy-relevant findings in a short time frame. It was made possible thanks to the existing structure of the NIHR HPRU in Respiratory Infections, renewed in April 2020.  -  ‘Community transmission and viral load kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 delta (B.1.617.2) variant in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals in the UK: an observational, longitudinal, cohort study’ by Anika Singanayagam et al. is published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases.  This article is based on materials from The Lancet.  Frequently asked questions  Does the study show that vaccinated and unvaccinated become infected and pass on Covid-19 at the same rate?  No. Regarding ‘becoming infected’: vaccinated persons are less likely to become infected than unvaccinated persons but they are still at risk of acquiring infection in the household setting (which involves close and prolonged exposure) with 25% of vaccinated contacts becoming infected.  Our study also estimated that around 38% of unvaccinated household contacts become infected. However, the sample sizes were small and the confidence intervals correspondingly wide, i.e. precision was low. The infection rate (secondary attack rate) among vaccinated contacts could therefore be as low as 18% and that among unvaccinated contacts could be as high as 53%, which is consistent with vaccination conferring substantial protection against infection.  Furthermore, since the study was a snapshot of current transmission in real-life UK households where most unvaccinated persons are teenagers and children, the unvaccinated contacts were on average younger than the vaccinated contacts.  Since younger people have a somewhat lower risk of acquiring infection than older adults, an ideal head-to-head comparison of infection rates in vaccinated vs unvaccinated contacts would need to compare large groups of the same age range, which was not possible given that most UK adults are vaccinated, and most UK teenagers not yet vaccinated. This limitation was acknowledged in the ‘Discussion’ section of the article.  The overall conclusion is therefore that vaccinated contacts have appreciable risk of acquiring infection from household members with COVID-19 but this risk is lower than in unvaccinated contacts.  Regarding ‘passing on infection’: the study found that vaccinated COVID-19 cases (breakthrough infections) infected 25% of their household contacts, indicating that even vaccinated cases are infectious to their close contacts.  For contacts exposed to unvaccinated cases, a similar proportion (23%) became infected. However, the sample sizes were small and the confidence intervals correspondingly wide, i.e. precision was low. The transmission from vaccinated cases could therefore be as low as 15% and that from unvaccinated cases as high as 31% which is consistent with vaccinated cases being half as infectious as unvaccinated cases.  Moreover, the study was a snapshot of current transmission in real-life UK households where most unvaccinated persons are teenagers and children. Since these younger age groups are known to be somewhat less infectious than older adults, an ideal head-to-head comparison of the infectiousness of vaccinated vs unvaccinated cases would need to compare large groups of the same age range, which was not possible given that most UK adults are vaccinated and most UK teenagers not yet vaccinated.  The overall conclusion is therefore that vaccinated breakthrough cases can efficiently transmit infection but most likely at a lower rate than age-matched unvaccinated persons.  Some use the study as evidence of the redundancy of the vaccines and the vaccine passport. Is this correct?  No. Vaccines are highly effective and are having a decisive impact on the pandemic both for individuals and whole populations. There is ample published evidence that definitively shows that vaccines are effective at preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection (including with Delta variant) and highly effective at preventing severe illness, hospitalisation and death from COVID-19. There is no sense in which COVID-19 vaccines can be considered redundant.  The implication of our results for vaccine passport mandates is that if one attends an event where everyone has a vaccine passport, it does not guarantee that no transmission will occur between those present - but the transmission would be much less than at an event where no-one is vaccinated.  Some experts have noted that in the study's analysis on the SAR, no adjustment or stratification for age is done. Therefore, as the median age for unvaccinated is lower than for the vaccinated, the study is not informative of the comparison between vaccinated and unvaccinated in respect of the rate of passing on the virus. Is this true?  The study provided a snapshot of current transmission in real-life UK households where most unvaccinated persons are teenagers and children. Compared to older adults, these younger age groups are known to be less likely to become infected and somewhat less infectious when they are infected.  The overall conclusion of the study is therefore that vaccinated contacts can become infected in households and vaccinated breakthrough cases can efficiently transmit infection to household members - but very probably at a lower rate than would be seen in age-matched unvaccinated persons.  An ideal comparison of vaccinated vs unvaccinated cases would need to compare large groups of the same age range, but this was not possible because most UK adults are vaccinated and most UK teenagers are not yet vaccinated.  This was mentioned among other limitations of the study in the penultimate paragraph of the ‘Discussion’ section of the article and is also addressed above in detail.

474,316281761148944453338682001018633537350,"The Indonesian government needs to jettison its hopes of a miracle cure to COVID-19, and listen to the advice of epidemiologists and health experts.  Advertisement  On July 29, Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan, Indonesia’s Coordinating Maritime and Investment Minister, made a comment that many would view as stating the obvious: “Now we understand that tracing is important in handling COVID-19,” he said to journalists during his visit to a medical oxygen supply facility in East Jakarta.  Given that Luhut is in charge of the emergency restrictions designed to fight the pandemic, many Indonesians interpreted his remark as evidence that the government has been very late in understanding the importance of tracing, although the country’s epidemiologists and other public health experts have been communicating its importance since the beginning of the pandemic. Indeed, it is incomprehensible that the government has only just now realized the importance of tracing those infected with COVID-19.  Luhut made another startling statement on August 9, claiming that the government would exclude the death rate from the indicators of its pandemic response, citing “errors in the data entry that caused distortion in the judgment.”  That decision is contrary to the World Health Organization’s guidance that mortality should be one of the primary indicators for assessing pandemic responses. Amid the inevitable outcry from experts, the government later clarified that the decision was only a temporary measure while it made efforts to clean up the data.  Diplomat Brief Weekly Newsletter N Get briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific. Get the Newsletter  Both of these comments pointed to the fact that the Indonesian government has largely disregarded the advice of experts during the pandemic, resulting in systemic failures in its response to COVID-19. For example, senior officials were downplaying experts’ warnings about the seriousness of the virus as early as January 2020, leading the government to underestimate its dangers and respond belatedly to the spread of the virus.

Consider his response when journalists asked for his comment about a study by researchers at Harvard University’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, which concluded that the coronavirus could have arrived in Indonesia in February 2020. He discredited the study by challenging the researchers to come to Indonesia to prove their study.  Even after the virus was confirmed to be in Indonesia, Terawan underestimated it by saying that “the flu was more dangerous” because of its higher death rate. His continued underestimation of the pandemic, his arrogant, anti-science attitude, and his alleged incompetence in handling the pandemic, led to him being replaced as minister in December 2020.  Terawan’s anti-science orientation should have come as no surprise. The military doctor had a decorated career, having served as head of the Indonesian Army (TNI-AD)’s main hospital. But he had also courted controversy for formulating a quack “brainwash” therapy for stroke patients – a method roundly criticized by the medical community. It involved a technique called digital subtraction angiography (DSA), which doctors argued as not a therapy for healing patients, but only a tool for diagnosing the disease. The Indonesian Medical Association (IDI) dismissed him for violating the medical code of ethics and not cooperating when IDI summoned him over the matter.  Advertisement  But being replaced as minister was not the end for Terawan, and he quickly returned to spotlight with a new project to develop a dendritic cell-based COVID-19 vaccine called the “Nusantara vaccine,” Dendritic cells are those responsible for the initiation of adaptive immune responses. Terawan’s project has been conducted with an “autologous” method, which in this case involves isolating a patient’s dendritic cells, treating it, then injecting it back to the same patient. This personalized and exclusive approach is contrary to the goal of developing a vaccine that can be used by as many people as possible to achieve herd immunity in the population.  At first, the Indonesian Food and Drug Authority (BPOM) did not authorize the vaccine to proceed to Phase II trials, after finding problems during the previous phase of the trials. Nevertheless, the vaccine found support from military figures and politicians, who pressured BPOM to allow its trials to continue. Ultimately, in April of this year, BPOM agreed to an MoU that the vaccine development would continue, but it would not receive distribution authorization from BPOM. It became a research on dendritic cells under the supervision of the Health Ministry.  Terawan is far from being the only government figure who undermined the authority of experts during the pandemic. Other military figures and politicians, as well as government agencies, have also raced to develop so-called COVID-19 “cures,” far exceeding their official roles and mandates.  One of the cures endorsed by several government figures is ivermectin, the antiparasitic drug whose usefulness for treating COVID-19 lacks credible scientific evidence. In June, some cabinet members even claimed that BPOM had authorized the use of ivermectin to treat the virus. BPOM soon clarified that its authorization of ivermectin was as an anthelmintic (drugs used to treat worms and parasites), not as a COVID-19 drug.  In July 2021, BPOM shut down the factory of an ivermectin manufacturer after finding several violations. Nevertheless, the media soon reported that the company was suspected of having lobbied several government officials, including officials in the Defense Ministry and the State Palace, to approve the use of ivermectin as a COVID-19 drug. A local NGO also found links between members of political parties and public officials with the ivermectin manufacturer. Ultimately, BPOM agreed to authorize clinical trials of ivermectin as a COVID-19 drug.  Another example is the combination of drugs that has been pushed by the Indonesian State Intelligence Agency (BIN) and TNI-AD as a treatment for COVID-19. In August 2020, BPOM said that the drugs’ clinical trials had not followed proper procedures, and declined to authorize their use. Nevertheless, in July 2021, it was revealed that the research has continued, combining several existing drugs into one.  Of course, the above is not an exhaustive list of the various examples of the Indonesian government’s disregard of public health experts, nor its support for pandemic mitigation measures that are not recommended by experts in the field. However, it is still a worrying phenomenon that needs to be resolved if Indonesia is to contain the current severe outbreak of COVID-19.  Enjoying this article?

It is more difficult to discuss the reason why such sentiments are so widespread . One probable reason is that due to the various failures of its pandemic response, the Indonesian government is desperate for an easy way out of a hopeless situation. Hence, many factions in the government have tried to build gratifying fantasies of magical cures for the disease, while denying the unpleasant fact that there is no shortcut out of it. Political elites want to be able to claim credit for these “cures,” while businesses hope to reap benefits from them.  The Indonesian government must cease its anti-expertise sentiment – especially during the current serious outbreaks of COVID-19 – and listen more closely to the advice of experts in shaping its pandemic response. Experts do sometimes fail, and are not always in the best position to decide on difficult political trade-offs, but other experts can recognize each other’s errors and provide advice to correct and rectify their failures. Meanwhile, anti-expertise sentiment only makes us resistant to learning important lessons that are needed to improve our pandemic response.","An Anti-Expertise, Anti-Science Attitude is Undermining Indonesia’s Pandemic Response",true
475,325319004916346934877291509512924943833,"Israel was way ahead of the rest of the world when it came to COVID vaccination, so it’s not surprising that data from this corner of the Mediterranean causes a lot of excitement – it’s a glimpse into the future.  Indeed, this happened recently when researchers at Maccabi Healthcare Services in Tel Aviv released a preprint (a study that is yet to be reviewed by other experts) suggesting people who had been infected with COVID had greater protection than vaccinated people against becoming reinfected with the delta variant. Unfortunately, some took this to mean that getting COVID is a better idea than getting vaccinated.  First, the possibility that a COVID infection leads to longer-lived immunity than vaccination is not far-fetched. Infection exposes our immune system to several viral proteins, whereas the most commonly used COVID vaccines introduce a single antigen: the spike protein. This results in a more directed but also a more restricted immune response than after infection.  Although people who have had COVID can get reinfected, naturally acquired immunity continues to evolve over time and antibodies remain detectable for longer than was first anticipated. New evidence suggests that immunity following both severe and mild infection protects against both symptomatic and asymptomatic reinfection.  However, apart from the danger of drawing conclusions from data that other scientists have not yet reviewed, it is also crucial to put the data in the right context. Although the study draws attention to the potency of naturally acquired immunity, it does not consider the risks involved in achieving natural immunity through infection. Nor does it cast a shadow on vaccine-generated immunity.  In fact, the benefit of vaccination is not even addressed in the study since unvaccinated people without prior infection were not included for comparison. The low rate of COVID-related hospitalisations among vaccinated participants (eight out of 16,000) would probably be strikingly lower than among non-vaccinated people without prior infection, but this group was not included in the analyses.  A common reason to remain unvaccinated is the misconception that waiting for natural immunity by choosing infection over vaccination is an option. But infection-acquired immunity may come at a heavy cost.  Indeed, apart from the overt risks of severe illness or death, several recent studies show that otherwise healthy people who have recovered from COVID have a substantially increased risk of longer-term serious health problems, including myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle), blood clots and stroke, compared to vaccinated people. And the most rigorous safety monitoring in US history has shown that COVID vaccines are safe and effective.  With cases surging globally and deaths driven by the delta variant, waiting for infection – and risking long-term health problems, severe illness and death – to achieve immunity to the very same infection is as fruitless as it is dangerous.  Hybrid immunity  The Israeli preprint does, however, shed light on our increasing understanding of the potent immunity induced by getting the vaccine after having COVID – so-called hybrid immunity. Several studies show a substantial boost in both antibody and T-cell responses to vaccine in people with previous COVID infection.  A recent report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that people who’d recovered from COVID and were later vaccinated had half the risk of reinfection compared with unvaccinated people who’d previously had COVID. So it’s still worth getting the vaccine, even if you have previously had COVID.  The effective immune booster following the combination of natural immunity and a single subsequent vaccine jab also raises the question of whether one dose is enough for people who have had COVID. Several studies report that immune responses to a single dose of either the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccine exceed those after two doses in people without prior infection.  Several countries, such as France, Italy and Germany, therefore now recommend a single dose for people with a previous COVID infection. And infection without vaccination is recognised as immunity for the current Israeli green pass rules.  Although directing boosters to people who have not been infected may make the most of limited vaccine supplies, personalised schedules and exemptions from vaccine mandates may be logistically tricky in the midst of a pandemic. Antibody screening before vaccination is time-consuming and expensive, and it introduces practical challenges in identifying those who have or haven’t previously had COVID. These exemptions could slow vaccine rollout rather than speed it up.  As unprecedented research efforts deliver knowledge about our immune responses to COVID infection and vaccination on a daily basis, we must critically view the data together with all the facts that relate to it. We are far from bringing the pandemic to an end, and the potential risks of being infected are unquestionable. Our priority should be to slow transmission and get vaccines to those who remain unvaccinated and need them the most. To avoid vaccination, wait for infection and hope for natural immunity makes little sense.",COVID infections may give more potent immunity than vaccines – but that doesn’t mean you should try to catch it,true
476,137122259927535493904716150166366117009,"The natural immune protection that develops after a SARS-CoV-2 infection offers considerably more of a shield against the Delta variant of the pandemic coronavirus than two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, according to a large Israeli study that some scientists wish came with a “Don’t try this at home” label. The newly released data show people who once had a SARS-CoV-2 infection were much less likely than never-infected, vaccinated people to get Delta, develop symptoms from it, or become hospitalized with serious COVID-19.  The study demonstrates the power of the human immune system, but infectious disease experts emphasized that this vaccine and others for COVID-19 nonetheless remain highly protective against severe disease and death. And they caution that intentional infection among unvaccinated people would be extremely risky. “What we don’t want people to say is: ‘All right, I should go out and get infected, I should have an infection party,’” says Michel Nussenzweig, an immunologist at Rockefeller University who researches the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and was not involved in the study. “Because somebody could die.”  The researchers also found that people who had SARS-CoV-2 previously and received one dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine were more highly protected against reinfection than those who once had the virus and were still unvaccinated. The new work could inform discussion of whether previously infected people need to receive both doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine or the similar mRNA vaccine from Moderna. Vaccine mandates don’t necessarily exempt those who had a SARS-CoV-2 infection already and the current U.S. recommendation is that they be fully vaccinated, which means two mRNA doses or one of the Johnson & Johnson adenovirus-based vaccine. Yet one mRNA dose might be enough, some scientists argue. And other countries including Germany, France, Italy, and Israel administer just one vaccine dose to previously infected people.  The study, conducted in one of the most highly COVID-19–vaccinated countries in the world, examined medical records of tens of thousands of Israelis, charting their infections, symptoms, and hospitalizations between 1 June and 14 August, when the Delta variant predominated in Israel. It’s the largest real-world observational study so far to compare natural and vaccine-induced immunity to SARS-CoV-2, according to its leaders.  The research impresses Nussenzweig and other scientists who have reviewed a preprint of the results, posted yesterday on medRxiv. “It’s a textbook example of how natural immunity is really better than vaccination,” says Charlotte Thålin, a physician and immunology researcher at Danderyd Hospital and the Karolinska Institute who studies the immune responses to SARS-CoV-2. “To my knowledge, it’s the first time [this] has really been shown in the context of COVID-19.”  Still, Thålin and other researchers stress that deliberate infection among unvaccinated people would put them at significant risk of severe disease and death, or the lingering, significant symptoms of what has been dubbed Long Covid. The study shows the benefits of natural immunity, but “doesn’t take into account what this virus does to the body to get to that point,” says Marion Pepper, an immunologist at the University of Washington, Seattle. COVID-19 has already killed more than 4 million people worldwide and there are concerns that Delta and other SARS-CoV-2 variants are deadlier than the original virus.  The new analysis relies on the database of Maccabi Healthcare Services, which enrolls about 2.5 million Israelis. The study, led by Tal Patalon and Sivan Gazit at KSM, the system’s research and innovation arm, found in two analyses that never-infected people who were vaccinated in January and February were, in June, July, and the first half of August, six to 13 times more likely to get infected than unvaccinated people who were previously infected with the coronavirus. In one analysis, comparing more than 32,000 people in the health system, the risk of developing symptomatic COVID-19 was 27 times higher among the vaccinated, and the risk of hospitalization eight times higher.  “The differences are huge,” says Thålin, although she cautions that the numbers for infections and other events analyzed for the comparisons were “small.” For instance, the higher hospitalization rate in the 32,000-person analysis was based on just eight hospitalizations in a vaccinated group and one in a previously infected group. And the 13-fold increased risk of infection in the same analysis was based on just 238 infections in the vaccinated population, less than 1.5% of the more than 16,000 people, versus 19 reinfections among a similar number of people who once had SARS-CoV-2.  No one in the study who got a new SARS-CoV-2 infection died—which prevented a comparison of death rates but is a clear sign that vaccines still offer a formidable shield against serious disease, even if not as good as natural immunity. Moreover, natural immunity is far from perfect. Although reinfections with SARS-CoV-2 are rare, and often asymptomatic or mild, they can be severe.  In another analysis, the researchers compared more than 14,000 people who had a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and were still unvaccinated with an equivalent number of previously infected people who received one dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The team found that the unvaccinated group was twice as likely to be reinfected as the singly vaccinated.  “We continue to underestimate the importance of natural infection immunity … especially when [infection] is recent,” says Eric Topol, a physician-scientist at Scripps Research. “And when you bolster that with one dose of vaccine, you take it to levels you can’t possibly match with any vaccine in the world right now.”  Nussenzweig says the results in previously infected, vaccinated people confirm laboratory findings from a series of papers in Nature and Immunity by his group, his Rockefeller University colleague Paul Bieniasz and others—and from a preprint posted this month by Bieniasz and his team. They show, Nussenzweig says, that the immune systems of people who develop natural immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and then get vaccinated produce exceptionally broad and potent antibodies against the coronavirus. The preprint, for example, reported that people who were previously infected and then vaccinated with an mRNA vaccine had antibodies in their blood that neutralized the infectivity of another virus, harmless to humans, that was engineered to express a version of the coronavirus spike protein that contains 20 concerning mutations. Sera from vaccinated and naturally infected people could not do so.  As for the Israel medical records study, Topol and others point out several limitations, such as the inherent weakness of a retrospective analysis compared with a prospective study that regularly tests all participants as it tracks new infections, symptomatic infections, hospitalizations, and deaths going forward in time. “It will be important to see these findings replicated or refuted,” says Natalie Dean, a biostatistician at Emory University.  She adds: “The biggest limitation in the study is that testing [for SARS-CoV-2 infection] is still a voluntary thing—it’s not part of the study design.” That means, she says, that comparisons could be confounded if, for example, previously infected people who developed mild symptoms were less likely to get tested than vaccinated people, perhaps because they think they are immune.  Nussenzweig’s group has published data showing people who recover from a SARS-CoV-2 infection continue to develop increasing numbers and types of coronavirus-targeting antibodies for up to 1 year. By contrast, he says, twice-vaccinated people stop seeing increases “in the potency or breadth of the overall memory antibody compartment” a few months after their second dose.  For many infectious diseases, naturally acquired immunity is known to be more powerful than vaccine-induced immunity and it often lasts a lifetime. Other coronaviruses that cause the serious human diseases severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome trigger robust and persistent immune responses. At the same time, several other human coronaviruses, which usually cause little more than colds, are known to reinfect people regularly.",Having SARS-CoV-2 once confers much greater immunity than a vaccine—but vaccination remains vital,true

Those guidelines heavily implied that fully vaccinated children and adults would not need to wear masks in the classroom — although they also said that individual schools were free to implement universal mask mandates.  In many other ways, however, the two sets of guidelines are similar.

478,281483003869577413775635963346404519767,"As vaccination rates lag and the new delta variant surges, Covid infection rates among kids have risen and children’s hospitals are seeing a spike in medical care needs among the young patients.  The Covid surge is also stacking upon an unseasonable spike in respiratory illnesses among children typically seen only in winter. That has shrunk the bed space further in children's hospitals and expanded on the unrelenting demand on doctors and nurses.  “It is scary, especially for kids who don’t fully understand what’s going on. They’re air hungry, struggling for breath, and it’s just scary,” said Dr. Kelechi Iheagwara, medical director of the pediatric intensive care unit at the Our Lady of the Lake Children’s Hospital in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. “You have the illness, the fear, they can’t breathe, they’re isolated — that’s hard for anyone to understand, but can you imagine what it’s like for a kid?”  Kelechi Iheagwara, the medical director of Our Lady of the Lake Children's Hospital Pediatric Intensive Care Unit. Our Lady of the Lake Children's Hospital  Her hospital has treated Covid in children ages from 3-week-olds to 17-year-olds in recent weeks. Iheagawara said that for the past month, her unit has had to treat 25 or 26 patients in a space designed for 20. And things are getting worse.  Multiple doctors in the half-dozen children’s hospitals NBC News reached out to said they have seen children infected because a member of their household, often a parent, brings the coronavirus home. Oftentimes, it is because an adult in the home is unvaccinated.  “Absolutely, household infections are the beginning of this pandemic, that is a major driving force in the spread of infections. We see it often within households, parents to children,” said Dr. Jim Versalovic, the chief pathologist and interim chief pediatrician at Texas Children’s Hospital in Houston. “We have certainly seen siblings — more than two at times — with an infection at the same time, so spread within households is certainly a very real phenomenon.”  The Covid-19 spike hit the Baton Rouge children's hospital in mid-July and brought its monthly total to 75 cases — the highest number of coronavirus hospitalizations during the entire pandemic. With 27 children admitted to the emergency room over the first four days of August, the hospital has already seen more child hospitalizations than it saw in the entire month of June.  Combined with the rise in out-of-season virus infections this summer, the hospital has been at bed capacity for weeks and the number of Covid cases among kids is projected to grow for the next two to three months. It remains particularly concerning as children under 12 remain the most vulnerable to Covid since they are not yet able to receive the vaccinations.  “We’re also a trauma center, so we have to be available for kids that get in car accidents and things like that,” said Dr. Trey Dunbar, the president of Our Lady of the Lake Hospital. “My fear is that with our staffing crunch, if this surge continues, how do we keep caring for the kids that we need to have beds for?”  Children’s hospitals in areas seeing a surge in Covid cases are experiencing the same pattern: More children are coming in with Covid symptoms just ahead of the start of the school year. Bed shortages and overworked doctors and nurses in children’s hospitals are becoming commonplace.  Arkansas Children’s Hospital in Little Rock had 23 patients under 18 admitted to its system last week. Ten were in the ICU and five were on ventilators.  St. Louis Children’s Hospital in Missouri saw 13 kids come to the ER for Covid in the last week of July, and then it saw 20 who needed beds in the first week of August.  At Texas Children’s Hospital in Houston, Covid positivity rates have risen from around 3 percent to above 10 percent among kids. The number of hospitalized children was in the single digits several weeks ago but rose to more than 30 last week.  Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said Friday that there are 13 children hospitalized with Covid at Children's Hospital New Orleans, including six under the age of 2. Four children are in the ICU, including a 3-month-old boy, a 23-month-old girl, an 8-year-old girl and a 17-year-old boy.  Mark Toney, chief of the Hospital Pediatrics Program at Wolfson Children's Hospital in Jacksonville, Fla., talks with medical students and nursing staff on the rounds of one of the pediatric wards on Aug. 6, 2021. Toney and his staff are dealing with are increasing numbers of Covid-19 infected children. Bob Self / Florida Times-Union via USA Today Network  ""Children in Louisiana have died of Covid and more unfortunately will die,"" said Dr. John Vanchiere, a pediatric infectious disease specialist, as he stood next to Bel Edwards at a news conference last week. ""This is not a time for politics, for fighting or threatening lawsuits about masks. Masks save lives. And if you're a pro-life Louisiana resident like I am, wear your mask.""  At least 81 children in the U.S. died of Covid between March and July, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and many doctors warn that the situation is likely to get worse.  Local reactions to these growing numbers are mixed, however. The governors of Texas and Florida, both Republicans, have refused to change course on their opposition to mask use and any other precautions, even after President Joe Biden implored them to “please help” or “get out of the way.”  Meanwhile, the Covid surge and resulting hospitalization rate have grown so bad in Arkansas that Gov. Asa Hutchinson, a Republican, recently advocated for a mask mandate in schools there. This comes months after he signed a bill banning state and local mask mandates.  Doctors and experts said that kids who returned to school last school year did so successfully because Covid precautions were in place. But as the CDC and state and local governments relaxed their guidelines this year, many of those safeguards evaporated.  “This new variant is a major contributor, but a major issue is that people’s behavior has changed,” said Gigi Gronvall, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. “I don’t think we can absolve people and leaders of responsibility for this because it gives them a pass. The reason kids are getting infected is because we don’t have those precautions and parents and households are getting infected.”  Wearing masks to prevent the spread of Covid, elementary school students walk to classes to begin their school day in Godley, Texas, on Aug. 5, 2020. LM Otero / AP  Many of the doctors interviewed expressed frustration that a large number of people within their community remained unvaccinated and are even openly hostile to the measure. It is having a negative effect on morale, many said, especially as the work once again increases.  “When I say they’re tired, they’re beyond that. They’re like, ‘I’m done,’” said Dr. Jason Newland, a Washington University infectious disease physician at St. Louis Children’s Hospital. “People are saying they just don’t want to do it anymore, and so we’re growing more and more limited in bed capacity. Hospital administrators are trying to figure these staffing shortages out — hats off to them — but these conversations are difficult because it comes down to the children and these families that need to be cared for.”  Children under 12 are especially in need of that care as they are the one group that remains completely unvaccinated. The Food and Drug Administration has not released emergency authorization for them to get the shot, fueling worries as many kids are scheduled to begin school in the coming weeks.  Versalovic, whose hospital in Texas is involved in the Pfizer and the Moderna vaccine trials for kids under 12, said that they don’t anticipate sending the FDA their data until well after the start of the school year.  A child watches as a nurse administers a shot of COVID-19 vaccine during a pop-up vaccination event at Lynn Family Stadium in Louisville, Ky., on April 26, 2021. Jon Cherry / Getty Images file  “Hopefully, there will be emergency authorization soon after we release the data, but we have to face the reality of beginning the school year without it,” he said. “We do anticipate having vaccines available for kids during the first half of the school year, but for children under 5 that’s likely to occur later in the year, possibly early 2022. It’s going to be an ongoing effort.”  That’s tough for many to hear, even in places where Covid outbreaks have not recently spiked. In areas that are only seeing a moderate increase in cases, children’s hospitals are still worried as they combat a surge in respiratory viruses while facing the looming school year and a large population that remains unvaccinated.  Dr. Cameron Mantor, the chief medical officer at the Oklahoma Children’s Hospital in Oklahoma City, said they are contending with a number of children in hospital beds stricken with respiratory diseases normally seen in winter, as well as a depleted workforce. A surge in Covid cases, like what they saw this year or what the northeast part of the state is combating now, could overwhelm them.  “Our challenge is to figure out how we don’t get ourselves back into the situation that we had months ago,” he said. “The big question is, how do we get all these people vaccinated? How do we let them know it’s safe and very effective? How do we dispel all the myths?”",Kids sick with Covid are filling up children's hospitals in areas seeing spikes,true

Follow this story and more by signing up for national breaking news email alerts.  The delta variant of the coronavirus appears to cause more severe illness than earlier variants and spreads as easily as chickenpox, according to an internal federal health document that argues officials must “acknowledge the war has changed.” The document is an internal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention slide presentation, shared within the CDC and obtained by The Washington Post. It captures the struggle of the nation’s top public health agency to persuade the public to embrace vaccination and prevention measures, including mask-wearing, as cases surge across the United States and new research suggests vaccinated people can spread the virus.  The document strikes an urgent note, revealing the agency knows it must revamp its public messaging to emphasize vaccination as the best defense against a variant so contagious that it acts almost like a different novel virus, leaping from target to target more swiftly than Ebola or the common cold.  Some people are catching coronavirus after being vaccinated. Johns Hopkins University infectious disease expert Lisa Maragakis gives advice on how to stay safe. (Video: John Farrell/The Washington Post, Photo: The Washington Post)  It cites a combination of recently obtained, still-unpublished data from outbreak investigations and outside studies showing that vaccinated individuals infected with delta may be able to transmit the virus as easily as those who are unvaccinated. Vaccinated people infected with delta have measurable viral loads similar to those who are unvaccinated and infected with the variant.  Advertisement  “I finished reading it significantly more concerned than when I began,” Robert Wachter, chairman of the Department of Medicine at the University of California at San Francisco, wrote in an email.  CDC scientists were so alarmed by the new research that the agency earlier this week significantly changed guidance for vaccinated people even before making new data public.  The data and studies cited in the document played a key role in revamped recommendations that call for everyone — vaccinated or not — to wear masks indoors in public settings in certain circumstances, a federal health official said. That official told The Post that the data will be published in full on Friday. CDC Director Rochelle Walensky privately briefed members of Congress on Thursday, drawing on much of the material in the document.  Advertisement  One of the slides states that there is a higher risk among older age groups for hospitalization and death relative to younger people, regardless of vaccination status. Another estimates that there are 35,000 symptomatic infections per week among 162 million vaccinated Americans.  The document outlines “communication challenges” fueled by cases in vaccinated people, including concerns from local health departments about whether coronavirus vaccines remain effective and a “public convinced vaccines no longer work/booster doses needed.”  The presentation highlights the daunting task the CDC faces. It must continue to emphasize the proven efficacy of the vaccines at preventing severe illness and death while acknowledging milder breakthrough infections may not be so rare after all, and that vaccinated individuals are transmitting the virus. The agency must move the goal posts of success in full public view.  Advertisement  The CDC declined to comment.  “Although it’s rare, we believe that at an individual level, vaccinated people may spread the virus, which is why we updated our recommendation,” according to the federal health official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. “Waiting even days to publish the data could result in needless suffering and as public health professionals we cannot accept that.”  The presentation came two days after Walensky announced the reversal in guidance on masking among people who are vaccinated. On May 13, people were told they no longer needed to wear masks indoors or outdoors if they had been vaccinated. The new guidance reflects a strategic retreat in the face of the delta variant. Even people who are vaccinated should wear masks indoors in communities with substantial viral spread or when in the presence of people who are particularly vulnerable to infection and illness, the CDC said.  Advertisement  The document presents new science but also suggests a new strategy is needed on communication, noting that public trust in vaccines may be undermined when people experience or hear about breakthrough cases, especially after public health officials have described them as rare.  Matthew Seeger, a risk communication expert at Wayne State University in Detroit, said a lack of communication about breakthrough infections has proved problematic. Because public health officials had emphasized the great efficacy of the vaccines, the realization that they aren’t perfect may feel like a betrayal.  “We’ve done a great job of telling the public these are miracle vaccines,” Seeger said. “We have probably fallen a little into the trap of over-reassurance, which is one of the challenges of any crisis communication circumstance.”  Advertisement  The CDC’s revised mask guidance stops short of what the internal document calls for. “Given higher transmissibility and current vaccine coverage, universal masking is essential to reduce transmission of the Delta variant,” it states.  The document makes clear that vaccination provides substantial protection against the virus. But it also states that the CDC must “improve communications around individual risk among [the] vaccinated” because that risk depends on a host of factors, including age and whether someone has a compromised immune system.  The document includes CDC data from studies showing that the vaccines are not as effective in immunocompromised patients and nursing home residents, raising the possibility that some at-risk individuals will need an additional vaccine dose.  The presentation includes a note that the findings and conclusions are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the CDC’s official position.  Advertisement  The internal document contains some of the scientific information that influenced the CDC to change its mask guidance. The agency faced criticism from outside experts this week when it changed the mask guidance without releasing the data, a move that violated scientific norms, said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania.  “You don’t, when you’re a public health official, want to be saying, ‘Trust us, we know, we can’t tell you how,’” Jamieson said. “The scientific norm suggests that when you make a statement based on science, you show the science. … And the second mistake is they do not appear to be candid about the extent to which breakthroughs are yielding hospitalizations.”  The breakthrough cases are to be expected, the CDC briefing states, and will probably rise as a proportion of all cases because there are so many more people vaccinated now. This echoes data seen from studies in other countries, including highly vaccinated Singapore, where 75 percent of new infections reportedly occur in people who are partially and fully vaccinated.  Advertisement  The CDC document cites public skepticism about vaccines as one of the challenges: “Public convinced vaccines no longer work,” one of the first slides in the presentation states.  Walter A. Orenstein, associate director of the Emory Vaccine Center, said he was struck by data showing that vaccinated people who became infected with delta shed just as much virus as those who were not vaccinated. The slide references an outbreak in Barnstable County, Mass., where vaccinated and unvaccinated people shed nearly identical amounts of virus.  “I think this is very important in changing things,” Orenstein said.  A person working in partnership with the CDC on investigations of the delta variant, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak, said the data came from a July 4 outbreak in Provincetown, Mass. Genetic analysis of the outbreak showed that people who were vaccinated were transmitting the virus to other vaccinated people. The person said the data was “deeply disconcerting” and a “canary in the coal mine” for scientists who had seen the data.  Advertisement  If the war has changed, as the CDC states, so has the calculus of success and failure. The extreme contagiousness of delta makes herd immunity a more challenging target, infectious-disease experts said.  “I think the central issue is that vaccinated people are probably involved to a substantial extent in the transmission of delta,” Jeffrey Shaman, a Columbia University epidemiologist, wrote in an email after reviewing the CDC slides. “In some sense, vaccination is now about personal protection — protecting oneself against severe disease. Herd immunity is not relevant as we are seeing plenty of evidence of repeat and breakthrough infections.”  The document underscores what scientists and experts have been saying for months: It is time to shift how people think about the pandemic.  Kathleen Neuzil, a vaccine expert at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, said getting more people vaccinated remains the priority, but the public may also have to change its relationship to a virus almost certain to be with humanity for the foreseeable future.  “We really need to shift toward a goal of preventing serious disease and disability and medical consequences, and not worry about every virus detected in somebody’s nose,” Neuzil said. “It’s hard to do, but I think we have to become comfortable with coronavirus not going away.”  GiftOutline Gift Article","‘The war has changed’: Internal CDC document urges new messaging, warns delta infections likely more severe",true
480,144335015352323140040064590453996495137,"A new policy report from the British Society for Immunology explores what we do and don’t know about immunity to SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes COVID-19. Understanding immunity induced by both natural infection and through vaccination, is key in our ability to exit the current pandemic. The information in this review was put together by our expert group.  Here is an accessible Q&A for a public audience summarising the main points from the report and what the immunology research priorities should be for scientists working in this area. You can also read the full report and the news story accompanying the report launch on our website.  For more information about COVID-19 vaccinations, we have published a free ‘Guide to vaccinations for COVID-19’ for the public, aimed at providing easy to understand information on how vaccines work and answering common questions.  Immunity to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, following natural infection  What does immunity to SARS-CoV-2 look like?  Your immune system has many ways to fight off an infection. One of the ways is for specialised immune cells called B cells to create proteins called antibodies. These antibodies stick to the virus to mark it for destruction by the immune system or prevent it from entering your cells. Another way the immune system fights off infection is by activating other specialised immune cells called T cells, which can attack and kill any of your cells that are infected with the virus. These specific B cells, their antibodies and T cells will remain in the body as memory cells after the infection has gone.  About 90% of people who have encountered SARS-CoV-2 and mounted an immune response will have antibodies to it in their blood and these can be tested for.  The initial immune response appears to be linked with severity of disease, with those people who experience a more severe illness having a stronger immune response. However, in some cases the immune response itself can be damaging to your tissues or it induces excessive inflammation. We need to be able to distinguish between a protective immune response and a damaging immune response and studies looking into this are ongoing.  Does everyone make the same immune response to SARS-CoV-2?  No. The immune response varies hugely between different people. Some people create a very effective immune response, so they will not get sick again from SARS-CoV-2 and will not pass the virus to anyone else. Others will make antibodies and be protected from getting sick with COVID-19 but may still be infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus and transmit it to others. Most people who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 make some form of immune response but whether this is effective at preventing reinfection in the future is not easy to determine.  We need to identity which immune markers (antibodies, T cells etc.) predict who is immune to COVID-19 and who is susceptible to either mild or severe disease. These markers will allow us to identify people who are at particular risk.  Are there any other factors that will have an impact on the level of immunity generated?  There are many factors that have an impact on the level of immunity generated, including age. Older people are less likely to make effective immune responses to infection, while there is evidence that children have a reduced antibody response to SARS-CoV-2.  Additionally, those people with weakened immune systems because of certain diseases or medication, will not be able to make as good an immune response as young healthy people.  How long does immunity to SARS-CoV-2 last?  As SARS-CoV-2 has only been around for a year, it is difficult to fully understand how long immunity lasts after infection. Current evidence suggests that antibody concentrations in the blood of people who have been infected do decline over time but can persist in some people for at least 8 months, and possibly longer, after infection. It has also been found that B and T cells that recognise SARS-CoV-2 are also present in the blood 8 months after infection. Exactly how long immunity will last will need a longer time to be determined but research into this is ongoing. For this reason, we do not yet know enough about the duration of protection to issue ‘immunity passports’.  Can I become infected with SARS-CoV-2 twice?  It is possible to be reinfected with SARS-CoV-2, but this is extremely rare. Reinfection will depend on both the level of immunity a person gains from the first infection and the level of exposure to the virus due to social and working environments.  Immunity to SARS-CoV-2 following vaccination  What sort of protection does COVID-19 vaccination give me?  So far, we know that the three currently approved COVID-19 vaccinations in the UK (BioNTech/Pfizer, Moderna, Oxford-AstraZeneca) prevent people getting sick with COVID-19. We don’t yet know if any of these vaccines stop people becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 and whether they prevent you from spreading the virus. We know that the vaccines reduce your chance of getting ill with COVID-19 but we don’t know if you can still be carrying the virus, even if you don’t have any symptoms and feel well. This could mean that vaccinated people still spread the virus unknowingly. Continued monitoring of clinical trial participants and those who have received the vaccines will reveal this in the future. Therefore, even after you’ve been vaccinated, it is important to keep following other measures to prevent the spread of the virus including mask wearing, social distancing and hand hygiene.  In the same way that natural infection varies widely between different people, the immune response to a vaccine may be different in some people. For example, older people and immunocompromised people may not make as strong an immune response to a vaccine compared with young healthy people. This will continue to be evaluated but vaccination is still recommended in these groups of people as they are at higher risk of severe COVID-19. We need to understand how well the vaccines work in different groups of people so that guidance can be adapted to make sure that the right vaccines are directed to the right patients.  Will the vaccines still work against the new variants of the virus?  It is not yet known if all the vaccines will protect against all the new variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, knowledge of the immune system leads us to assume that vaccines will still be effective against minor variations of the virus. The approved vaccines in the UK were tested in clinical trials before the new variants were widespread, so we don’t have a lot of information yet on their efficacy against the variants but research is ongoing to address this. The virus variants will need to be monitored and evaluated to assess if current vaccines will continue to provide protection against these new variants. We may need to tweak the vaccines to induce an appropriate immune response to new variants.  How long will the vaccine protect me from getting ill with COVID-19?  It is not yet known how long immunity to COVID-19 from vaccines will last. It is suggested that immunity will last for at least a year so we may therefore need to revaccinate people at high risk of severe disease every year, much like we do for the annual flu vaccine. Research into how long immunity lasts after COVID-19 vaccination is ongoing.  Is it better to gain immunity naturally or through vaccination?  The only way to get naturally acquired immunity would be through infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes the disease. When infected, you become infectious to other people around you and can spread the disease. Infection poses a serious risk to your health, potentially making you very ill and causing long-term health effects. Vaccination allows you to build up immunity in a safe and controlled way without becoming ill with COVID-19 and passing it to others. Vaccines decrease your chance of developing COVID-19 and reduce how unwell you become if infected.  Vaccines are capable of stimulating a better immune response than the natural infection. It is hoped that vaccines for COVID-19 will provide protective immunity for at least as long as natural immunity or longer, which is why you will still be offered the vaccine even if you’ve had COVID-19 in the past. It is likely that, in a significant proportion of the population, the vaccine will induce more effective and longer lasting immunity than that induced by natural infection. Hence it is recommended that everyone take the vaccine so that if your immunity after disease is absent or low, it can be boosted.

481,4246069377081890612236921346532887234,"The SARS-CoV-2 variants that have emerged in the past few months have attracted an immense amount of speculation. Specifically, whether the mutations may confer an advantage to the virus, render our antibodies ineffective, and lead to vaccine escape. New research has uncovered why the G614 strain (with a substitution for aspartic acid by glycine at position 614 in the spike protein) and its recent variants—which are now the dominant circulating forms of the virus—facilitate rapid viral spread.  The work, led by Bing Chen, PhD, at Boston Children’s Hospital, analyzed how the structure of the spike protein changes with the D614G mutation. Using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), which has resolution down to the atomic level, they report structures of a full-length G614 spike trimer which adopts three distinct prefusion conformations differing primarily by the position of one receptor-binding domain (RBD). Chen’s team found that the D614G mutation makes the spike more stable as compared with the original SARS-CoV-2 virus.  This work is published in Science, in the paper, “Structural impact on SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by D614G substitution.”  In the original coronavirus, the spike proteins would bind to the ACE2 receptor and then dramatically change shape, folding in on themselves. This enabled the virus to fuse its membrane with our own cells’ membranes and get inside. However, as Chen and colleagues reported in July 2020, the spikes would sometimes prematurely change shape and fall apart before the virus could bind to cells. While this slowed the virus down, the shape change also made it harder for our immune system to contain the virus.  “Because the original spike protein would dissociate, it was not good enough to induce a strong neutralizing antibody response,” said Chen.  When Chen and colleagues imaged the mutant spike protein, the authors noted that a loop disordered in the D614 spike trimer wedges between domains within a protomer in the G614 spike. This added interaction, they added, appears to “prevent premature dissociation of the G614 trimer, effectively increasing the number of functional spikes and enhancing infectivity, and to modulate structural rearrangements for membrane fusion.” In short, the more functional spikes are available to bind to cells’ ACE2 receptors, making the virus more infectious.  The researchers found that the D614G mutation stabilizes the spike by blocking the premature shape change. Interestingly, the mutation also makes the spikes bind more weakly to the ACE receptor, but the fact that the spikes are less apt to fall apart prematurely renders the virus overall more infectious.  “Say the original virus has 100 spikes,” Chen explained. “Because of the shape instability, you may have just 50% of them functional. In the G614 variants, you may have 90% that are functional, so even though they don’t bind as well, the chances are greater that you will have infection.”  Chen proposes that redesigned vaccines incorporate the code for this mutant spike protein. The more stable spike shape should make any vaccine based on the spike more likely to elicit protective neutralizing antibodies, he said. Indeed, the Moderna, Pfizer, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines are all based on the spike protein.  Chen and his colleagues are further applying structural biology to better understand how SARS-CoV-2 binds to the ACE2 receptor, with an eye toward therapeutics to block the virus from gaining entry to our cells.  In January, the team showed in Nature Structural & Molecular Biology that a structurally-engineered “decoy” ACE2 protein binds the virus 200 times more strongly than the body’s own ACE2. The decoy potently inhibited the virus in cell culture, suggesting it could be an anti-COVID-19 treatment. Chen is now planning to advance this research into animal models.","SARS-CoV-2 D614G Mutation Stabilizes Spike Protein, May Explain Faster Spread",true

The AAP urges families to check with their pediatrician and community health care providers about how to get their eligible children vaccinated, pending a final recommendation from the CDC.  Vaccinating children will protect children’s health and allow them to fully engage in all of the activities that are so important to their health and development. Parents can enjoy greater peace of mind gathering with family members this winter and sending their children to school, sports and other events that were paused during the height of the pandemic.  “Sharing this life-saving vaccine with our children is a huge step forward and provides us all with more confidence and optimism about the future,” said AAP President Lee Savio Beers, MD, FAAP. “Pediatricians are eager to participate in the immunization process and talk with families about this vaccine. We want to ensure that access to this vaccine is equitable, and that every child is able to benefit.”  Immediately after the ACIP vote to recommend the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for children ages 5 to 11, the AAP published its updated recommendations for COVID-19 vaccine, including a strong recommendation for children in this age group to receive the vaccine pending the final decision by the CDC. The AAP recommends COVID-19 vaccination for all children and adolescents 5 years of age and older who do not have contraindications using a vaccine authorized for use for their age. Children with prior COVID-19 infection or disease should receive a COVID-19 vaccination to prevent a second infection and to lower the risk of severe illness and hospitalization.  The Academy also updated its interim school guidance, which calls for the continued use of layers of protection, including universal mask-wearing in schools to protect all students and adults. AAP strongly advocates for in-person learning, which can happen safely with adherence to recommended policies and procedures. The guidance revision emphasizes the importance of immunization and masking as the most important risk mitigation strategies, as supported by new evidence.  “We know from our experience with the Delta variant that this virus is unpredictable, and we cannot afford to be complacent. It is critical to use science and data to guide our decisions about the pandemic and school COVID-19 plans,” Dr. Beers said. “We have also entered flu season, and now have an opportunity for children to receive vaccinations for both the flu and COVID-19, which can be done during a single visit.”  The AAP recognizes that disparities in school funding, quality of school facilities, educational staffing, and resources for enriching curricula among schools have been exacerbated by the pandemic. Ongoing federal, state, and local funding should be provided for all schools so they can continue to implement all the COVID-19 mitigation and safety measures required to protect students and staff.

SAN FRANCISCO (KGO) -- California Governor Gavin Newsom's unusual disappearance from public view has the ""Twitterverse"" buzzing and Newsom's wife telling inquiring critics to ""stop hating and get a life.""Newsom was in Monterey Tuesday for a fireside chat at the California Economic Summit, making his first public appearance since he got his booster shot on Oct. 27.Newsom touched on his personal life balancing family and work, which he describes ""hell of a couple years for all of us,"" especially for all parents. When asked about the last nearly two weeks of his absence from public events including the long-planned trip to the UN climate conference in Scotland, Newsom said he spent time with his kids.""They kind of had an intervention, they said they couldn't believe that I was gonna miss Halloween,"" he said. ""And I woke up that next morning with something's probably familiar to a lot of parents that knot in your stomach that had no damn choice. I had to cancel that trip.""But prior to that, questions about the governor's whereabouts were swirling around social media. It started when the possible Presidential contender abruptly canceled a long-planned trip to the United Nations climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland.Newsom cited unspecified ""family obligations"" as the reason for the last-minute stay-at-home decision, but gave no specifics.Questions really started to bubble up after the governor who rarely goes a day without some type of media appearance went silent after receiving a highly touted COVID booster shot.Here's one of the tweets:""Gavin Newsom has not been heard from since he had his booster shot 11 days ago. There is no way that he would keep people guessing if the shot made him sick, and therefore less likely to get one themselves unless that's exactly what happened.'So what's going on?According to ABC7 News Contributor Phil Matier's reliable sources, planning for Newsom's trip to Glasgow began more than a year ago when Donald Trump was still in the White House.At the time, Newsom's presence was seen as a necessary presence on the world stage in an attempt to counter Trump's anti-climate change policies.Former Governor Jerry Brown played the role in the early Trump years and by former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger when George Bush was President.But now Joe Biden is President and was scheduled to attend the conference representing the U.S., and Newsom was given a three-minute speaking spot.Glasgow, Scotland, in October, is a long way to go for a four-day confab and a three-minute speaking spot and then an equally long flight back.Newsom bowed out, and instead, Lieutenant Governor Eleni Kounalakis led the delegation that included about a dozen legislators.The governor's schedule, however, suddenly had a week of no public appearances.And where has Newsom been since his booster shot on Oct. 27?According to first partner Jennifer Siebel Newsom, the governor has been a working dad which is likely the real ""family obligation"" he has been missing out on while successfully battling the September recall attempt.""Funny how some people can't handle the truth. When someone cancels something, maybe they are in the office just working; maybe in their free time they are at home with their family, or at their kid's sports matches, or dining out with their wife. Please stop hating and get a life,"" Siebel Newsom said in a tweet that was quickly deleted.Not that the governor has been home the whole time.Newsom was front and center in San Francisco Saturday for the lavish wedding of a long-time family friend and Getty oil heiress Ivy Love Getty.The wedding was officiated by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, just back from her big infrastructure bill victory.One might expect such a star-studded event to trigger a constellation of tweets from guests but alas they were all told to park their phones at the door, as Vogue had an exclusive on all wedding photographs.As for Newsom, consider the brief silence a bit of a blessing.

484,13863396326125996898942389521724964235,"A medical worker fills a syringe with a dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine at Tokyo Medical Center in Tokyo on Feb. 17. (AP Photo)  Japan’s rollout of COVID-19 vaccines began belatedly in mid-February, months behind the United States and many other countries. Officials blamed a shortage of Pfizer Inc. vaccine from Europe as the main culprit in the delay. But three months later, with shipments stabilized and officials attempting to accelerate vaccinations, Japan remains one of the world’s least protected.  Officials say there is a critical shortage of trained staff to give shots. Despite Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga’s pledge to have all eligible people fully vaccinated by the end of September, some officials say it could take until next year. It will be impossible for Japan to achieve protective “herd immunity” in the two months before the Tokyo Olympics are to begin.  It’s uncertain whether Japan’s already-strained healthcare system can treat extra visitors during the games as it struggles to handle local patients and mass inoculations.  Suga’s government is facing heavy pressure from a public increasingly frustrated by the slow vaccine rollout and repeated declarations of states of emergency. Many now oppose hosting the Olympics.  WHY THE VACCINE DELAY?  The slow start was because Japan requested domestic clinical trials in addition to Pfizer Inc.’s testing in other countries.  Dozens of nations accepted the results of Pfizer’s multinational tests released in November and began vaccinations. The additional testing in Japan took extra months, though the government then took just two months to grant its approval for the vaccine, much faster than the typical one year.  The vaccine made by Moderna Inc. is to be approved later this month after a similar process for use at two large-scale inoculation centers in Tokyo and Osaka. Approval for a third, AstraZeneca, is pending.  WHY DID JAPAN ASK FOR MORE DATA?  People in Japan are often skeptical about foreign-made drugs, especially vaccines, and officials say they needed to thoroughly address safety concerns.  Pfizer’s international tests were conducted from July to November on about 44,000 people in six countries, including about 2,000 Asians. Japan requested tests on 160 Japanese people, triggering criticism that testing such a small number added little but delay.  Japanese health officials have defended the delay as necessary to build confidence in the vaccine. But Suga has recently acknowledged a need to adapt rules to cope with the emergency.  WHY IS VACCINE CONFIDENCE LOW?  Japan’s mistrust of vaccines is decades old, partly because side effects have often been played up.  In the 1990s, the government scrapped mandatory inoculations after a court ruling held it responsible for side effects linked to several vaccines.  More recently, Japan stopped recommending the human papillomavirus, or HPV, vaccine after media reports of alleged side effects, renewing concerns despite its widespread use overseas as protection against cervical cancer.  WHAT IS JAPAN’S VACCINE TIMELINE?  Inoculations started in Japan in mid-February and only about 1 percent of the population has been fully vaccinated. Less than one-third of the 4.8 million prioritized medical workers have received their second shots as of Wednesday.  Vaccinations for 36 million elderly people began in mid-April, and about half a million have received their initial shots. The government aims to finish their second shots by the end of July, at least a month behind the original schedule, but about 15 percent of municipalities say they still need more time, according to a government survey this week. Health experts and some officials say it may take until next spring for the rest of the population to be vaccinated.  DOES JAPAN HAVE ENOUGH VACCINE?  Japan has secured the supply of 344 million doses, enough to cover its entire population, through the end of this year. That includes 194 million doses from Pfizer, 120 million from AstraZeneca and 50 million from Moderna.  Vaccine shipments picked up in May, and health ministry data show that about 7 million doses are currently sitting unused in freezers, despite initial concerns of supply shortages.  Officials say their bigger concern is a shortage of medical staff to administer the shots. Only doctors and nurses are allowed to give them in Japan’s conservative medical culture.  Dentists are willing to help and are authorized but have not been called upon. Getting shots from pharmacists at drug stores as in the U.S. or from volunteers with no medical background other than brief training as in Britain remain unthinkable in Japan.  IS JAPAN DEVELOPING ITS OWN VACCINES?  Several Japanese companies and research organizations are developing possible coronavirus vaccines, including some that are being clinically tested. Shionogi and Co. said recently it hopes to get its vaccine candidate approved by the end of this year.  Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. will distribute the Moderna vaccine and produce the Novavax vaccine in Japan, and JCR Pharmaceuticals Co. will produce the AstraZeneca vaccine under a licensing deal.  Experts say vaccine development is unpopular in Japan because of its risks, the time-consuming process and a lack of government funding.",EXPLAINER: Why Japan has been slow to roll out vaccinations,true
485,31454963731038004347028774602040422691,"AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford today announced an agreement for the global development and distribution of the University’s potential recombinant adenovirus vaccine aimed at preventing COVID-19 infection from SARS-CoV-2.  The collaboration aims to bring to patients the potential vaccine known as ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, being developed by the Jenner Institute and Oxford Vaccine Group, at the University of Oxford. Under the agreement, AstraZeneca would be responsible for development and worldwide manufacturing and distribution of the vaccine.  Pascal Soriot, Chief Executive Officer, AstraZeneca, said: “As COVID-19 continues its grip on the world, the need for a vaccine to defeat the virus is urgent. This collaboration brings together the University of Oxford’s world-class expertise in vaccinology and AstraZeneca’s global development, manufacturing and distribution capabilities. Our hope is that, by joining forces, we can accelerate the globalisation of a vaccine to combat the virus and protect people from the deadliest pandemic in a generation.”  Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&D, AstraZeneca, said: “The University of Oxford and AstraZeneca have a longstanding relationship to advance basic research and we are hugely excited to be working with them on advancing a vaccine to prevent COVID-19 around the world. We are looking forward to working with the University of Oxford and innovative companies such as Vaccitech, as part of our new partnership.”  Alok Sharma, UK Business Secretary, said: “This collaboration between Oxford University and AstraZeneca is a vital step that could help rapidly advance the manufacture of a coronavirus vaccine. It will also ensure that, should the vaccine being developed by Oxford University’s Jenner Institute work, it will be available as early as possible, helping to protect thousands of lives from this disease.”  Professor Sir John Bell, Regius Professor of Medicine at Oxford University, said: “Our partnership with AstraZeneca will be a major force in the struggle against pandemics for many years to come. We believe that together we will be in a strong position to start immunising against coronavirus once we have an effective approved vaccine. Sadly, the risk of new pandemics will always be with us and the new research centre will enhance the world’s preparedness and our speed of reaction the next time we face such a challenge.”  Professor Louise Richardson, Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University, said: “Like my colleagues all across Oxford, I am deeply proud of the work of our extraordinarily talented team of academics in the Jenner Institute and the Oxford Vaccine Group. They represent the best tradition of research, teaching and contributing to the world around us, that has been the driving mission of the University of Oxford for centuries. Like people all across the country, we are wishing them success in developing an effective vaccine. If they are successful, our partnership with AstraZeneca will ensure that the British people and people across the world, especially in low and middle income countries, will be protected from this terrible virus as quickly as possible.”  The potential vaccine entered Phase I clinical trials last week to study safety and efficacy in healthy volunteers aged 18 to 55 years, across five trial centres in Southern England. Data from the Phase I trial could be available next month. Advancement to late-stage trials should take place by the middle of this year.  ChAdOx1 nCoV-19  Developed at the University of Oxford’s Jenner Institute, and working with the Oxford Vaccine Group, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 uses a viral vector based on a weakened version of the common cold (adenovirus) containing the genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. After vaccination, the surface spike protein is produced, which primes the immune system to attack COVID-19 if it later infects the body.  The recombinant adenovirus vector (ChAdOx1) was chosen to generate a strong immune response from a single dose and it is not replicating, so cannot cause an ongoing infection in the vaccinated individual. Vaccines made from the ChAdOx1 virus have been given to more than 320 people to date and have been shown to be safe and well tolerated, although they can cause temporary side effects such as a temperature, flu-like symptoms, headache or sore arm.

486,9760584251322343154879980817408811619,"August 29, 2014  ‘Lifestyles of the Rich Environmentalists,’ produced by a group called the Institute for Energy Research, is a slick web video campaign designed to lampoon Leonardo Dicaprio and will.i.am as hypocrites for supporting action on climate change. The claim is that wealthy celebrities who oppose industrial-scale pollution supposedly shouldn’t fly in airplanes that use fossil fuels. The group, along with its subsidiary, the American Energy Alliance, churns out a steady stream of related content, from Facebook memes criticizing the Environmental Protection Agency, to commercials demanding approval of new oil projects like the Keystone XL, to a series of television campaign advertisements this year attacking Democratic candidates in West Virginia, Colorado, North Carolina and Alaska. On Capitol Hill, IER aggressively opposes any effort to repeal tax breaks afforded to the oil and gas industry.  Documents obtained by Republic Report reveal for the first time that the group was actually founded by none other than Charles Koch, the petrochemical, manufacturing, and oil refining tycoon worth an estimated $52 billion.  IER has no information about its founding members on its website, and only lists a board composed of seemingly independent conservative scholars and businessmen. Earlier reports revealed that IER/AEA has received grants from Koch-funded foundations, and its leadership includes several individuals who have at times worked for Koch or Koch-related interests. But this is the first time it has been revealed that Charles personally founded the organization.  In October of 1984, Charles, then using a Menlo Park, California address founded a non-profit called the Institute for Humane Studies of Texas. That organization briefly lost its charter in 1989 for failure to pay the Texas state franchise tax. Four years later, incorporation documents reveal, the group rebranded as the Institute for Energy Research, or IER, which later formed a subsidiary called the American Energy Alliance.  IER/AEA’s advocacy contrasts sharply with Charles’ personal brand as a selfless libertarian activist. The industrialist has argued that he is resolutely against special government hand-outs, such as tax credits or subsidies that benefit one industry over another. “Far from trying to rig the system, I have spent decades opposing cronyism and all political favors, including mandates, subsidies and protective tariffs—even when we benefit from them,” Charles wrote in a column for the Wall Street Journal this year.  But Charles’ group, IER/AEA, has fought to protect special tax breaks that benefit fossil fuel producers. Along with issuing press releases against various federal efforts to eliminate oil and gas industry tax credits, IER/AEA commissioned a study claiming that such tax reforms would have an adverse effect on jobs and on oil production.  Charles and his brother David are personally responsible for founding and funding much of the modern conservative infrastructure. The popular libertarian think tank, the Cato Institute, was in fact first named the Charles Koch Foundation, Inc before rebranding. The largest political organization in America outside the Democratic and Republican parties is Americans for Prosperity, the Tea Party-organizing foundation also founded by the Kochs.  The latest organs in the Koch political network have carefully guarded the sources of their funding and direction. There is the new youth group, Generation Opportunity, along with the new veterans-related campaign organization, Concerned Veterans for America. But IER/AEA’s true origin casts new light on its motivations.","Charles Koch Personally Founded Group Protecting Oil Industry Hand-Outs, Documents Reveal",true

A deadly influenza virus has circulated widely in birds in recent years, decimating flocks but rarely spreading to humans. Nonetheless, because of its persistence in bird flocks, this highly pathogenic avian influenza virus has loomed as a major public health threat. Seasonal influenza kills less than 1 percent of the people it infects. In contrast, human infections with H5N1, though exceedingly rare, are fatal in more than half of cases. Should this virus mutate in a way that allows it to be transmitted as efficiently among people as seasonal influenza viruses are, it could take an unprecedented toll on human life.  A number of important scientific and public health questions regarding this virus remain unanswered, including the likelihood of such mutations arising and the mechanisms by which they may occur. Two recent studies co-funded by the National Institutes of Health have shed light on how this potentially grave human health threat could become a reality. Working carefully with influenza viruses they have engineered in isolated biocontainment laboratories, scientists in Europe and the United States have identified several mechanisms by which the virus might evolve to transmit efficiently in the ferret, the best animal model for human influenza infection. This research has allowed identification of genetic pathways by which such a virus could better adapt to transmission among people. This laboratory virus does not exist in nature. There is, however, considerable concern that such a virus could evolve naturally. We cannot predict whether it or something similar will arise naturally, nor when or where it might appear.  Given these uncertainties, important information and insights can come from generating a potentially dangerous virus in the laboratory. While the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention provide excellent public health surveillance for novel influenza strains, influenza outbreaks still occur suddenly and in unexpected places. The recent H1N1 pandemic exemplifies the problem: In 2009, a new influenza virus emerged. It was shown to have originated from an animal reservoir, and it spread so rapidly that it strained the pharmaceutical industry’s capacity to prepare vaccines fast enough to blunt its spread. We do not fully understand the underlying factors that allow influenza viruses to be transmitted efficiently in humans after they emerge from different species. The ferret transmission studies were intended in part to fill these important gaps in knowledge.  Understanding the biology of influenza virus transmission has implications for outbreak prediction, prevention and treatment. In defining the mutations required for mammalian transmission, public health officials are provided with genetic signatures that, like fingerprints, could help scientists more readily identify newly emergent, potentially harmful viruses, track their spread and detect threatening outbreaks. The ability to identify such viruses even a few months faster than by conventional surveillance provides critical time to slow or stop an outbreak. For example, the CDC implements public health protective measures and stockpiles antiviral drugs. Identifying threatening viruses can also facilitate the early stages of manufacturing vaccines that protect against such a virus in advance of an outbreak.  In addition, determining the molecular Achilles’ heel of these viruses can allow scientists to identify novel antiviral drug targets that could be used to prevent infection in those at risk or to better treat those who become infected. Decades of experience tells us that disseminating information gained through biomedical research to legitimate scientists and health officials provides a critical foundation for generating appropriate countermeasures and, ultimately, protecting the public health.  The question is whether benefits of such research outweigh risks. The answer is not simple. A highly pathogenic bird flu virus transmissible in humans could arise in ways not predicted by laboratory studies. And it is not clear whether this laboratory virus would behave in humans as it does in ferrets. Nonetheless, new data provide valuable insights that can inform influenza preparedness and help delineate the principles of virus transmission between species.  Along with support for this research comes a responsibility to ensure that the information is used for good. Safeguarding against the potential accidental release or deliberate misuse of laboratory pathogens is imperative. The engineered viruses developed in the ferret experiments are maintained in high-security laboratories. The scientists, journal editors and funding agencies involved are working together to ensure that access to specific information that could be used to create dangerous pathogens is limited to those with an established and legitimate need to know.",A flu virus risk worth taking,true

Suggest a fact check here.  The claim: Detroit election worker trainings 'reveal the mechanisms of the planned theft of the election'  A viral video shared by Big League Politics, an online news outlet that describes itself as a source for “hard-hitting investigative political journalism,” falsely claims that Detroit election workers were instructed to meddle in the election.  For weeks, the website, which has promoted conspiracy theories before, published audio recordings it says are from Detroit election worker trainings as part of its #DetroitLeaks series. The video — which has been removed from YouTube but was preserved by Big League Politics on a video hosting site known for sharing conspiratorial content — stitches the audio together to claim that “multiple Detroit pollworker trainings were audio-recorded, which reveal the mechanisms of the planned theft of the election.” Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel’s office confirmed that it sent a cease and desist letter to Big League Politics.  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  In an article that has since been removed from the Big League Politics website, reporter Shane Trejo wrote that the video detailed “explosive evidence of election trainers in the city of Detroit telling poll workers how to lie to voters, destroy ballots, and disenfranchise poll challengers on election day.” But the audio recordings — the latest in a string of misinformation related to the election in Michigan — do not point to anything nefarious, despite the video’s ominous-sounding music.  President Donald Trump received nearly 5,000 more votes from Detroit this most recent election compared with his 2016 performance, according to the city’s unofficial results. Meanwhile, President-elect Joe Biden underperformed in Detroit compared with 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, who won nearly 1,000 more votes than Biden based on Detroit’s unofficial results.  Detroit City Clerk Janice Winfrey said the snippets in the video were misused. “What was recorded and shared was taken out of context. All laws were followed in training of election workers, in full compliance,” she said.  Text appearing in the video describes what it alleges Detroit election workers were told to do followed by audio and transcripts of election worker trainings to support each claim. We looked at the supposed instructions one by one and found that taken together, they do not support the claim that Detroit election workers were trained to help steal the election.  'Step 1: Kick out the poll challengers.'  This is not the advice that the trainer imparted. In the audio, the trainer is heard telling poll workers that all challengers have to wear masks and practice social distancing. At one point the trainer joked that unless challengers have really good vision or brought binoculars, they would not be able to see what election workers are doing. However, even with social distancing, hundreds of challengers were able to monitor Detroit’s absentee ballot count and challenge voters’ eligibility to cast a ballot.  In the video, an election worker is heard asking what steps should be taken if election challengers cause a scene. The trainer says to call the police. Challengers have to abide by conduct standards, the trainer explains. On the day before the election, when Detroit election workers began processing absentee ballots, two election challengers were escorted out of the counting room by the police. One challenger was wearing a horror movie mask and caused a disruption while another challenger refused to properly wear her face mask. Wednesday afternoon, police had to push back an angry crowd of Republican poll challengers who had been prohibited from entering the counting room after the number of Republican, Democratic and nonpartisan challengers reached the limit allowed under state law. More than 100 Republican challengers remained in the room to monitor the count.  More:Michigan AG to right-wing website: Take down misleading videos  More:Michigan was a hotbed for election-related misinformation: Here are 17 key fact checks  'Step 2: Process challenged ballots as regular ballots to be counted.'  In text that scrolls over the screen, the video claims that election workers were instructed to “process challenged ballots as regular ballots to be counted.” That’s a mischaracterization. In an audio recording, a trainer is heard saying that in order to record a ballot as challenged, election workers should place the ballot in a secrecy sleeve and cover the ballot number with a Post-It. The trainer goes on to say that after election workers have taken these steps, a voter can go vote as normal.  Voters whose eligibility is challenged on the basis of age, residency or citizenship can, in fact, receive a ballot and vote as normal after showing proof of eligibility or swearing under oath that they meet the requirements. Even after a challenged voter’s eligibility has been established, their ballot is specially marked — in ink below the barcode and covered with tape — and labeled in the electronic poll book.  'Step 3: Allow anyone with an easily-forged piece of paper to vote.'  That’s not the instruction. In the recording, the trainer lays out the process for handling a newly registered voter who is not listed in the electronic poll book used by inspectors to check registrations. Michigan allows registration right up to 8 p.m. on Election Day.  The trainer explains that since the voter records are downloaded to the electronic poll book the Saturday before Election Day, newly registered voters would not yet be listed. Those voters are given a receipt to present to poll workers on Election Day as evidence that they registered. The receipt indicates whether the voter needs to present any additional ID to confirm his or her eligibility. Poll workers can then add the voter manually to the rolls.  The video claims, “Anyone with the know-how could generate thousands of fake late registration receipts.” Voters have to present ID when they vote or sign an affidavit affirming they are eligible. Falsifying a voter registration receipt is a crime. Meanwhile, voters manually added to the rolls are recorded separately in the poll book so they can be rechecked against records later.  'Step 4: Staff polling stations with children.'  By law, 16- and 17-year-olds can work as election inspectors, but not as the precinct chairperson. In the audio recording, the trainer says that young people who can’t stay out late for the final duties on Election Day — returning the sealed ballot containers and other records and equipment to the local receiving board — should tell the chairperson, so another adult can help with that. The video seems to imply that this opens the door for someone to tamper with election materials.  Election materials are safeguarded by election workers, and state rules require ballots and other election materials to be delivered — in sealed containers and envelopes — to the receiving board by one precinct inspector affiliated with the Democratic Party and another affiliated with the Republican Party.  'Step 5: Nobody available to call for help.'  That’s wrong; troubleshooters are available. In the recording, a trainer explains that on Election Day, election workers will be able to call designated troubleshooters should any issues arise. The trainer says, “Honestly speaking, it’s going to be hard to get ahold of someone, because there’s going to be 10 people calling us at the same time.”  This is typical since Election Day is a busy time for election officials who are often running around the city to make sure the voting process is running smoothly. It may be difficult to immediately get in touch with officials, but that does not mean that election workers did not or could not get help on Election Day.  'Step 6: Count challenged ballots, DESTROY provisional ballots'  This is misleading. The trainer in the video is heard discussing what election workers should do if a voter shows up to vote in person on Election Day if the clerk has already received the voter’s absentee ballot. The trainer tells election workers, “Do not issue him a ballot.” The trainer explains that voters are allowed to vote only once and that if a voter already cast an absentee ballot, they cannot vote again in person on Election Day.  If the voter insists that they did not already vote, the trainer explains that the chairperson can issue the voter a provisional ballot that will not go through the tabulator to be counted and will be destroyed if the voter already voted absentee.  This is common practice for provisional ballots, which are kept out of the count pending confirmation that they were legally cast.  Challenged voters, by contrast, receive ballots only after poll workers receive proof or sworn affirmation that the voter is eligible and registered. Their ballots are specially marked and recorded in the electronic poll book, then tabulated normally.  Our ruling  A viral video claims that Detroit election worker trainings “reveal the mechanisms of the planned theft of the election.” The trainings do not indicate any coordinated effort to meddle in the election. Rather they describe customary practices for handling voters and ballots in accordance with the state’s election rules.  We rate the video’s claim False.

489,170386489009014447210636857799409847381,"Correction Appended  About two weeks ago, a security team spotted scorch marks on a basement doorway below 4 World Trade Center, on the east side of the ruined complex, according to officials.  Even in a place of mass devastation and death, those scorch marks got fast attention. They had not been noticed by a patrol team a few hours earlier, and behind the damaged -- but intact -- door were nearly a thousand tons of gold and silver. To security officials, it looked as if someone had tried to break in.  Within hours, a video surveillance system was installed to keep at least an electronic eye on the precious metals until their custodian, the Bank of Nova Scotia, had a chance to remove them. That work began this week.  A team of 30 firefighters and police officers are helping to move the metals, a task that can be measured practically down to the flake but that has been rounded off at 379,036 ounces of gold and 29,942,619 ounces of silver.  As layers of debris are peeled away, recovery workers are opening gangways to intact portions of a 16-acre basement that was largely unseen but was a place of spectacular scope in its own right. Just the basement area of the World Trade Center enclosed twice as much space as the entire Empire State Building.  Nearly a quarter of a mile below the spectacular vistas from the towers was their upside-down attic dropping 70 feet below the ground, a strange world with enough room for fortunes in gold and silver, for Godiva chocolates, assault weapons, old furniture, bricks of cocaine, phony taxicabs and Central Intelligence Agency files. With so many people still lost, the owners of this stuff have maintained a discreet silence during the recovery operations. But that doesn't mean they're not interested.  Beneath the Customs House -- 6 World Trade Center -- was an armada of government vehicles, including dozens owned by the Secret Service, in a fenced-off area. Within that area was a garage where a single armored limousine was parked under the tightest security.  The limousine was so long that it needed straight-line access to the street, because it could not clear tight corners in the basement.  That car had been used to carry heads of state visiting the city, said Tony Ball, a spokesman for the Secret Service. (The president's limousines are stored in Washington and flown everywhere he visits.)  In the 1993 trade center bombing, an armored Secret Service limousine was parked about 100 feet from a truck bomb. Although the bomb crashed through five stories of concrete and the concussion destroyed cars all over that floor, the Secret Service limousine ''did not even have a broken windshield,'' according to a government official on the scene that day. The condition of the limousine after September's attack was not known yesterday. ''We haven't gotten anything back yet,'' Mr. Ball said.  Asked about reports that his agency also kept what looked like ordinary taxis and telephone company trucks in the basement, Mr. Ball laughed. ''What I would say is that it is not unusual for law enforcement agencies to have these kinds of things,'' he said.  Besides the Secret Service, the building named for the United States Customs Service also housed an office of the C.I.A.  That building is now partly collapsed, with a rubble pit 30 feet deep. Somewhere in there are drugs, weapons and contraband seized by the Customs Service at the region's airports. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms also lost two evidence vaults, according to a spokesman for that agency, Joseph Green. They have not yet been recovered.  ''There could be several hundred weapons -- somewhere between 200 and 400, ranging from small-caliber semiautomatic pistols to assault rifles,'' Mr. Green said, adding that a few of the guns had been found. Agents plan to be on the scene when the remains of the building are demolished sometime in the next two weeks, he said.  ''After that, we'll be working at the landfill to search for any important items that are still missing.''  For people who have seen the surface destruction, either in pictures or in person, it may be hard to imagine that anything is intact below ground. But engineers and recovery officials say that large parts of the underground perimeter are undamaged, even though the buildings above them are partly collapsed.  One area is below 4 World Trade Center, where more than two decades ago, Swiss Bank built a huge vault and storage area. The vault was reached from the Swiss Bank offices by a private elevator.  To reach the vaults, armored trucks would drive through what had once been the tunnels for the Hudson and Manhattan railroad, the predecessor of the PATH system. These tunnels had run as far east as Church Street, but were not needed when the trade center was built and the PATH terminal was set closer to the river.  The western stubs of the original tunnels, ringed with cast iron, were converted into roadways. These roads ran directly to a roll-down door in front of the Swiss Bank vault area. Inside was a loading dock.  By the time of the 1993 bombing, Swiss Bank no longer was using the vault, and shortly afterward, the bank relocated its remaining operations.  The next tenant of the vault space was the Bank of Nova Scotia, which estimated the value of the metals at $200 million.  ''We are in the process of relocating the contents of our vault at World Trade Center building No. 4 to another secure location, because authorities need to demolish the building,'' Pam Agnew, a spokeswoman for the bank, said yesterday by phone from Toronto.  Some of the metal is owned by the bank, and some by its customers, she said. She declined to say where the metals were being taken.  ''The contents remain safe and intact,'' Ms. Agnew said. ''The contents are fully insured. We're working very closely with local authorities to ensure a safe and secure relocation effort.  ''The removal of the contents was not a priority for us because we've always known it was safe and secure,'' Ms. Agnew said.  Asked about what appeared to be an attempted break-in two weeks ago, Ms. Agnew said that she was unaware of it. Later, she called to reiterate that the metals were safe: ''It would be factually incorrect to say there had been any attempt to steal the contents of our vault.''  However, a government official involved in the recovery efforts said that there had clearly been an attempt within the last two weeks to enter the vault area. ''It looked like they used a blowtorch, a crowbar,'' said the official, who spoke on the condition that neither his name nor his position be identified. ''The Port Authority police began periodic patrols, and then a closed-circuit television system was put in.''  The bank also engaged Kroll Inc., a security business based in New York, to supervise the relocation of the gold and silver, a process that began this week, The Daily News reported yesterday.  Michael Cherkasky, the president of Kroll, declined to comment on his company's involvement.  Anyone trying to make off with the gold would not be able to run very fast: each ingot weighs 70 pounds.

National Records of Scotland (NRS) published a new report, saying: “There have been three deaths in Scotland where the underlying cause of death was adverse effects of Covid-19 vaccines.”  NRS said the deaths were in the context of 2.81 million people having been given at least one dose of a vaccine by April 30, according to figures from Public Health Scotland.  Meanwhile, the latest figures from the NRS show there were six fatalities where coronavirus was recorded as an underlying cause between May 10 and May 16, a drop of one on the previous week.  The data also shows that post-coronavirus conditions, including long Covid, were mentioned on 11 death certificates in the period from March 2020 to April 2021.  In the six deaths from May 10 and 16, five involved people aged under 65 and the sixth was someone aged 75 or over.  North Lanarkshire recorded three of the deaths, Glasgow saw two, and Perth and Kinross recorded one.  This means deaths occurred in three of Scotland’s 32 council areas.  Pete Whitehouse, NRS director of statistical services, said: “Last week there were no registered Covid-19 deaths in 29 of Scotland’s 32 council areas. Across Scotland, six Covid-19 deaths were registered which is the lowest number since early September last year.  “The report also shows that deaths from Covid-19 continues to have a greater impact on people living in Scotland’s more deprived communities.  “Over the course of the pandemic, people living in these most deprived areas are 2.4 times as likely to die with Covid-19 than those living in the least deprived areas after adjusting for age.”  Four deaths occurred in hospital, one in a care home, and one in a non-institutional setting such as at home.  A total of 10,109 deaths have now been registered in Scotland where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate.  Meanwhile, the latest daily figures show Scotland has recorded 394 new coronavirus cases in the past 24 hours.  The Scottish Government figures show no new fatalities have been recorded, meaning the death toll under this daily measure – of people who first tested positive for the virus within the previous 28 days – remains at 7,664.  A total of 230,436 people have tested positive for the virus and the daily test positivity rate is 1.6%, down from 1.7% the previous day.  There were 78 people in hospital on Tuesday with recently confirmed Covid-19, up from 70, with four in intensive care – which is unchanged.  A total of 3,051,383 people have now received the first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine and 1,704,388 have had their second.  There are contrasting updates for the two local authorities in Scotland that remain under Level 3 restrictions.  New figures from Public Health Scotland show there were 109.9 cases per 100,000 people in Glasgow on Sunday using the seven-day positive test rate.  This was up from 105 per 100,000 on the previous day.  Moray’s positivity rate had fallen from 48 per 100,000 to 40.7, while Level 2 East Renfrewshire recorded a rate of 101.5 per 100,000 – up from 94.2.",Three deaths in Scotland linked to coronavirus vaccine,true

Sign up for the Today’s WorldView newsletter. By any measure, the United States has some of the top public health experts in the world. Yet as the novel coronavirus began to spread early this year, these U.S. experts repeatedly recommended against a simple tactic to prevent spreading the infection: face masks.  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in January that it did not recommend the use of masks for “people who are well.” On Feb. 29, U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams went further, tweeting a warning: “STOP BUYING MASKS.”  But weeks later, the advice was reversed. On April 3, as the number of deaths from the coronavirus in the United States surged to more than 7,000, the CDC altered its recommendation to state that “cloth face coverings” should be worn when social distance cannot be maintained.  When states first began lifting coronavirus lockdown measures in the summer, tensions around face masks had been mounting since the CDC first recommended them. (Video: The Washington Post, Photo: Sarah Hashemi/The Washington Post)  Still, even as the changed policy was announced, President Trump said he would not personally be doing it. Some Republican lawmakers have mocked the practice of wearing masks, while local rules requiring masks have been rescinded in some locations following a backlash.  Advertisement  The U-turn regarding masks and the subsequent political divide over them has come to symbolize the chaos of the U.S. response to the still-raging pandemic. It also may be particularly damaging for America’s global standing, as it has drawn in not just political leaders like Trump but also widely respected public health experts who did not initially back the wearing of face masks.  “I’ve always thought of the CDC as a reliable and trusted source of information,” Siouxsie Wiles, an infectious-diseases specialist at the University of Auckland in New Zealand, told The Post last week. “Not anymore.”  Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a key adviser on the pandemic in the early months, was asked at a House hearing this week whether he regretted the previous advice against masks.  Advertisement  Fauci said he did not regret the decision, arguing that at the time there was a “paucity of equipment” for front-line health workers.  Pool shot of audience at Pres. Trump’s speech in Arizona - the nation’s latest coronavirus hotspot - shows a single mask-wearer among the students sitting shoulder-to-shoulder. pic.twitter.com/SrbGnoGBTL — Kayla Tausche (@kaylatausche) June 23, 2020  The debate about masks could intensify in coming weeks as U.S. cases surge amid economic reopening. Some state governments are newly moving to mandate the wearing of masks in public, but plenty of people, including the president and some of his supporters, still rarely wear one.  In other nations, there is no such divide. In many Asian countries, surgical masks were socially acceptable long before the coronavirus pandemic, partly as a result of experience in past pandemics, like SARS in 2003.  “In Hong Kong, it is pretty common, even without an outbreak, to see people going around in masks because they may be sick and they don’t want to infect other people,” Keiji Fukuda, head of the University of Hong Kong’s School of Public Health, told Today’s WorldView in March.  Advertisement  As suspicion grew that asymptomatic cases were spreading the virus, many holdouts changed course. Singapore initially advised the general public against wearing masks but reversed that guidance, implementing a law on April 14 that imposed a $212 fine for those who flouted the rules.  Conducting high-quality research about the effectiveness of masks against the novel coronavirus is difficult during a pandemic, but a spate of studies released this summer supported mask-wearing.  One review funded by the World Health Organization and published in the Lancet journal looked at data from 172 observational studies and concluded that wearing face masks reduced the risk of coronavirus infection.  For many, this was all the evidence needed. Other policies for controlling the spread of the virus are enormously costly and practically difficult, from shutting down schools and offices to setting up complicated contact tracing. A mask, on the other hand, is cheap and has little downside.  Advertisement  And yet the U.S. president avoids wearing a mask in public, joining a small group of leaders that includes Mexico’s Andrés Manuel López Obrador and Belarus’s Alexander Lukashenko.  Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who brushed off the threat of the virus as his country amassed the second-highest death toll in the world, was this week ordered by a Brazilian federal judge to wear a mask when in public in Brasília.

As Fauci noted on Tuesday, there were early U.S. concerns about the availability of surgical masks and N95 masks for essential workers, which had a distorting effect on the debate.  Supply concerns are also believed to have influenced the WHO’s belated decision to change its own global guidance in favor of masks since June 5, as some nations would not have been able to supply masks.  Advertisement  Other factors include the United States’ decentralized political system, as well as Americans’ focus on protecting individual liberty. “Making individual decisions is the American way,” Max Parsell, a 29-year-old power-line worker in Jacksonville, Fla., recently told The Post as he justified his decision not to wear a mask.  But the relentless toll of the pandemic on the United States, as well as the ensuing protests after the death of George Floyd, has left many outside nations reappraising the world’s lone superpower.  “We live with the idea that the U.S. has an ability to rebound that is almost unlimited,” Michel Duclos, a former French ambassador to Syria, told the Atlantic recently. “For the first time, I’m starting to have some doubts.”  The United States has faced serious blows to its international reputation before, notably after the 2003 invasion of Iraq and any number of decisions involving Trump since 2016. However, this time it isn’t just partisan political leaders who are facing hard questions, but also apolitical subject experts.  Advertisement  Bloomberg Opinion this week asked writers around the world what they thought of the U.S. response to the coronavirus, and several mentioned the politically charged debate over masks, as well as broader concerns about the way the United States uses the expertise it has built up.  “America has some of the very best professionals and hospitals in the world,” Ferninando Guigliano, an Italian columnist, explained. “But it lacks a centralized structure that gives you confidence that the country as a whole can counter the pandemic effectively.”  This story has been updated with details regarding the WHO’s guidance on masks.

The delay comes as a blow to Johnson's plans to fully reopen the UK economy on June 21 after months of gradually easing restrictions since March.  Newspapers had been counting down to what had been dubbed ""Freedom Day"", which was set to mark an end to all social distancing restrictions and the reopening of nightclubs.  But Johnson said a sharp rise in infections had prompted a decision to ""ease off the accelerator"" and focus instead on ramping up vaccinations.  ""On the evidence I can see right now, I'm confident that we will not need more than four weeks and won't need to go beyond July 19,"" Johnson told a press briefing.  Health policy is devolved in the four nations that make up the UK, handled separately in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  Scotland, which was due to move to the lowest level of restrictions on June 28, is also expected to announce a delay to its reopening.  In England, most current rules -- including limits on the number of people who can meet in pubs and restaurants -- will remain in place until July 19, although restrictions on the number of guests allowed at weddings will be lifted.  Large scale pilot events, such as Euro 2020 football matches, will also go ahead as planned.  The more transmissible Delta variant, first identified in India, is now responsible for 96 percent of UK cases, and positive tests have jumped 50 percent in the last week.  Total reported cases are now at their highest since February -- around 8,000 new infections a day.  The Delta variant is believed to be around 60 percent more transmissible than the Alpha variant first identified in Kent, southeast England.  That strain forced the country to go into another three-month lockdown in January.  Nevertheless hospital admissions and deaths remain low, thanks in large part to Britain's rapid vaccination rollout.  Story continues  More than 55 percent of adults in the UK have had two vaccine jabs.  - Vaccine boost -  Newspapers have hinted at dissent within Johnson's cabinet over the delay, with The Times citing an unnamed minister as saying it was ""a very odd decision"".  Johnson accepted that ""we cannot simply eliminate Covid, we must learn to live with it,"" but added that ""once the adults of this country have been overwhelmingly vaccinated... we will be in a far stronger position to... live with this disease"".  The government hopes that two thirds of all adults will have received two shots by July 19.  A study released Monday found that two jabs of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine stopped the need for in-patient treatment in 96 percent of cases of the new variant.  With a double dose of the Oxford/AstraZeneca shot, the rate was 92 percent.  The government had hoped to allow crowds to return unrestricted to pubs and clubs next week, with the hard-hit hospitality industry warning it is on its last legs.  Trade association UKHospitality estimated that a month's delay in lifting the restrictions would cost the sector around £3 billion ($4.23 billion) in sales.

495,324869512618430956455658608946433351594,"Documents released by the US Marshals Service (USMS) confirm that the Trump administration conducted a nationwide program to deputize hundreds of federal agents during its crackdown on protesters last summer and fall. In many cases, those deputized were local police officers.  The documents reveal that the deputations under Operation Legend—launched by the US Justice Department on July 8, 2020 and promoted as a force for fighting crime in major US cities—were expedited across the country at the height of the protests against police violence triggered by the murder of George Floyd.  President Donald Trump speaks during a news conference with Finnish President Sauli Niinisto at the White House in Washington, October [Credit: AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster]  The nonprofit watchdog group American Oversight obtained the documents—533 pages of internal email messages and “Special Deputation Oath of Office” forms—through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. While Trump’s Attorney General William Barr reported last December that 6,000 people had been arrested by Operation Legend agents, the USMS has yet to provide American Oversight with the arrest data it is seeking as part of the FOIA request.  A report published by American Oversight on Thursday says the records it obtained “provide details about where many of the deputations took place as the program, which began in Kansas City, Mo., expanded to other cities. Deputation forms included in the records contain details about the officer’s parent law enforcement agency, where they made their oath of office, and the length of their deputation.”  While the names of the officers and the representatives of the sponsoring local agency are redacted from the forms, the records show 24 deputation oaths signed in Kansas City, 25 signed in Chicago, 15 signed in St. Louis, 38 signed in Milwaukee. The American Oversight report states, “The highest number of deputations in the records occurred in Albuquerque, with 58 oaths signed on Sept. 4 and Sept. 16. In some cases, the deputations were set to last months. In others, such as those involving the Milwaukee Police Department, the deputations appear to only extend for days or weeks.”  The internal email messages—also with identities of the individuals involved redacted—show that those submitting the oath documents were eager to get the deputations approved. For example, a representative of the Great Lakes Regional Fugitive Task Force (GLRFTF), with offices in Chicago and Hammond, Indiana, submitted a group of applications on July 23 to the USMS Special Deputations Branch saying, “the sooner we can get this back the better” because the “operation started Wed.”  An email from a USMS investigative analyst from the District of New Mexico requested a fast-track approval of deputation applications: “Please be advised that this is for Operation Legend. Please expedite.”  The American Oversight report explains that Operation Legend—which fraudulently exploited the death of four-year-old LeGend Taliferro, who was shot and killed while sleeping in his home in Kansas City, Missouri, on June 29, 2020—was essentially a rebranding of a previous USMS program called Operation Relentless Pursuit (ORP) that was launched by the Justice Department in December 2019 to “surge federal law enforcement resources into seven of America’s most violent cities.”  The actual purpose of the ORP program was to further then-President Trump’s reelection campaign “law and order” message. Once the protests against police violence began, following the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis on May 25, the Trump agenda shifted to a campaign against the protesters.  The American Oversight report explains that the federal deputation of officers was used to bring “increased federal charges against defendants” and that USMS task forces “often operate without the same oversight measures that may generally be required by local jurisdictions.” As was the case in the killing of Michael Reinoehl on September 3 in Lacey, Washington, agents from the FBI and USMS Pacific Northwest Violent Offender Task Force were mobilized by the Trump administration to execute the Portland protester in a hail of gunshots in complete violation of his constitutional rights.  In February, the criminal justice investigative journalism organization the Marshall Project published a report reviewing violence by federal marshals or deputized police officers in USMS task forces between January 1, 2015 and September 10, 2020. This report shows that 177 people were shot by these groups, 124 of whom died. The Marshall Project reported that federal officers shot 31 people a year and killed 22, a number greater than city police forces of similar sizes.  The Operation Legend program also took place alongside of the deployment by the Trump administration of paramilitary forces such as the Border Patrol Tactical Unit (BORTAC) of the Department of Homeland Security against protesters in cities such as Portland. As reported by the World Socialist Web Site, in July at least seven people were kidnapped by militarized camouflaged DHS agents driving unmarked vehicles and held for hours in unknown locations without cause or due process.  The expansion of federal agents operating in major US cities in violation of the US Constitution was part and parcel of the attack waged by the Trump administration on democratic rights and the attempt to establish a personalist dictatorship in the White House. This campaign reached a high point in June when Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act of 1807 seeking to mobilize active US troops against peaceful protesters in Washington D.C., and culminated in the assault on the US Capitol on January 6 by a fascist mob attempting to overturn the outcome of the 2020 presidential elections.  The increasing militarization of the police and the slandering of protests as “violent riots” by the right wing has been aided and abetted all along by the Democrats, who have endorsed the use of federal police in major cities under the guise of “fighting crime.” Throughout the summer, as Trump and Barr were mobilizing newly deputized federal agents, Democratic Party mayors Lori Lightfoot in Chicago and Mike Duggan in Detroit, for example, vouched for the White House and said that they needed the help.",Trump administration deputized hundreds of federal officers during crackdown on protesters,true

497,140726457597857267587934572155607181446,"As part of that investigation, Barr and John Durham, the federal prosecutor he appointed to conduct it, have been probing a conspiracy theory for which there is little if any evidence, according to several people with knowledge of the matter: that a key player in the Russia probe, a professor named Joseph Mifsud, was actually a Western intelligence asset sent to discredit the Trump campaign — and that the CIA, under Brennan, was somehow involved.  Trump, meanwhile, has become “obsessed” with Brennan, who frequently gets under the president’s skin by publicly questioning his mental acuity and fitness for office, according to a former White House official. On Brennan, “it was always, ‘he’s an idiot, he’s a crook, we ought to investigate him,’” this person said, characterizing Trump’s outbursts.  Since the beginning of his presidency, Trump has also repeatedly attacked Brennan publicly, tweeting about the former CIA director more than two dozen times. He’s questioned Brennan’s mental acuity and called him a liar, a leaker and blamed him for having “detailed knowledge of the (phony) Dossier,” a reference to the raw intelligence reports on Trump’s alleged Russia ties by British former MI-6 officer Christopher Steele. He also tried to unilaterally strip Brennan of his security clearance — a process the White House reportedly never went through with — and urged the House to call him in for questioning.  ....top of the FBI. Brennan started this entire debacle about President Trump. We now know that Brennan had detailed knowledge of the (phony) Dossier...he knows about the Dossier, he denies knowledge of the Dossier, he briefs the Gang of 8 on the Hill about the Dossier, which.... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 21, 2018  The emerging focus of the Barr-Durham investigation — the CIA and intelligence community’s work with the FBI on the Russia probe — emphasizes the increasingly blurred lines between politics and law enforcement in the Trump era. In May, Trump gave Barr unprecedented authority to review the intelligence community’s “surveillance activities” during the 2016 election, issuing a sweeping declassification order that granted Barr “unprecedented” powers over the nation’s secrets, former officials said.  It was a break with protocol that Trump’s allies see as a necessary check on the so-called “deep state” but that critics have lambasted as an attempt to create the impression of scandal—especially given Barr’s comments earlier this year hinting at a predisposed belief that inappropriate “spying” occurred in 2016 and that the Steele dossier may have been Russian disinformation.  Barr’s evidently close involvement with the Durham probe is in keeping with his reputation as a micromanager—and a fierce advocate of presidential prerogatives. As attorney general during the George H.W. Bush administration, he described later for an oral history interview, he comes across as a seasoned, bare-knuckled bureaucratic brawler who closely coordinated his actions with the White House counsel’s office.  “He was very competent and very detail-oriented,” said Bill Kristol, who was chief of staff to Vice President Dan Quayle and worked with Barr back then. Barr was “a very involved manager” of his department, Kristol said.  Durham’s report is likely to land well after the results of an inquiry by the Justice Department’s Inspector General, who is examining the FBI’s applications to a secret court in 2016 and 2017 to obtain surveillance warrants on a Trump campaign aide. Trump-friendly commentators have been raising expectations about the IG report, predicting that it will show the FBI purposefully misled the court to surveil Trump’s campaign, and have expressed frustration in recent days over its delayed release.  But former FBI officials on the receiving end of that probe say the president’s allies are setting themselves up for disappointment.  “Is the IG report going to say we made mistakes? Yes,” said one of the former officials. “But it won’t say we did so for some nefarious purpose. So the report will be a dry hole for Trump and his supporters. Which is why [Barr and Durham] have now gone to this other theory, positing that the CIA was engaged in some rogue operation to overthrow Trump and therefore feeding the FBI bullshit,” he said. “It’s complete nonsense.”  “Haven’t you heard?” said another former FBI official, sarcastically. “Brennan was a puppet-master and we were just his puppets.”  Brennan has spoken openly about working closely with the FBI on counterintelligence investigations, and acknowledged in an op-ed last year that he had “many conversations” with former FBI Director James Comey in 2016 “about the potential for American citizens, involved in partisan politics or not, to be pawns in Russian hands.”  The FBI launched its counterintelligence probe after learning that a Trump campaign aide, George Papadopoulos, was offered “dirt” on Hillary Clinton from a Russian proxy — Mifsud — and had told an Australian diplomat about it. Australian officials tipped off their American counterparts to Papadopoulos’s admission, though it’s still unclear who was initially tipped off, and that’s reportedly a subject of Barr’s investigation. The bureau then flew former FBI agent Peter Strzok over to London to interview Alexander Downer and an associate about his interactions with Papadopoulos.  Papadopoulos pleaded guilty in 2017 to lying to the FBI about his relationship with Mifsud, but he has since claimed, without evidence, that the professor was actually an intelligence plant sent by the CIA to entrap him and give the FBI an excuse to open an investigation.  The two agencies have a fraught history that at times has descended into open bureaucratic warfare. After the 9/11 attacks, for instance, officials at the CIA and the FBI blamed one another for lapses that failed to stop al Qaeda. And they sharply differed in their approaches to interrogating terrorist suspects, with FBI officials blasting their counterparts in Langley as brutish amateurs in the art of extracting valuable information.  The Durham probe also threatens to break those fissures back open.",Trump’s quest for vengeance against John Brennan,true

Hahn, M.D. “Today’s action follows an open and transparent review process that included input from independent scientific and public health experts and a thorough evaluation by the agency’s career scientists to ensure this vaccine met FDA’s rigorous, scientific standards for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality needed to support emergency use authorization. The tireless work to develop a new vaccine to prevent this novel, serious, and life-threatening disease in an expedited timeframe after its emergence is a true testament to scientific innovation and public-private collaboration worldwide.”  The FDA has determined that Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine has met the statutory criteria for issuance of an EUA. The totality of the available data provides clear evidence that Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine may be effective in preventing COVID-19. The data also support that the known and potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks, supporting the vaccine’s use in millions of people 16 years of age and older, including healthy individuals. In making this determination, the FDA can assure the public and medical community that it has conducted a thorough evaluation of the available safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality information.  The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine contains messenger RNA (mRNA), which is genetic material. The vaccine contains a small piece of the SARS-CoV-2 virus’s mRNA that instructs cells in the body to make the virus’s distinctive “spike” protein. When a person receives this vaccine, their body produces copies of the spike protein, which does not cause disease, but triggers the immune system to learn to react defensively, producing an immune response against SARS-CoV-2.  “While not an FDA approval, today’s emergency use authorization of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine holds the promise to alter the course of this pandemic in the United States,” said Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., Director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. “With science guiding our decision-making, the available safety and effectiveness data support the authorization of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine because the vaccine’s known and potential benefits clearly outweigh its known and potential risks. The data provided by the sponsor have met the FDA’s expectations as conveyed in our June and October guidance documents. Efforts to speed vaccine development have not sacrificed scientific standards or the integrity of our vaccine evaluation process. The FDA’s review process also included public and independent review from members of the agency’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee. Today’s achievement is ultimately a testament to the commitment of our career scientists and physicians, who worked tirelessly to thoroughly evaluate the data and information for this vaccine.”  FDA Evaluation of Available Safety Data  Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine is administered as a series of two doses, three weeks apart. The available safety data to support the EUA include 37,586 of the participants enrolled in an ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled international study, the majority of whom are U.S. participants. These participants, 18,801 of whom received the vaccine and 18,785 of whom received saline placebo, were followed for a median of two months after receiving the second dose. The most commonly reported side effects, which typically lasted several days, were pain at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain, and fever. Of note, more people experienced these side effects after the second dose than after the first dose, so it is important for vaccination providers and recipients to expect that there may be some side effects after either dose, but even more so after the second dose.  It is mandatory for Pfizer Inc. and vaccination providers to report the following to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) for Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine: all vaccine administration errors, serious adverse events, cases of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS), and cases of COVID-19 that result in hospitalization or death.  FDA Evaluation of Available Effectiveness Data  The effectiveness data to support the EUA include an analysis of 36,523 participants in the ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled international study, the majority of whom are U.S. participants, who did not have evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection through seven days after the second dose. Among these participants, 18,198 received the vaccine and 18,325 received placebo. The vaccine was 95% effective in preventing COVID-19 disease among these clinical trial participants with eight COVID-19 cases in the vaccine group and 162 in the placebo group. Of these 170 COVID-19 cases, one in the vaccine group and three in the placebo group were classified as severe. At this time, data are not available to make a determination about how long the vaccine will provide protection, nor is there evidence that the vaccine prevents transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from person to person.  The EUA Process  On the basis of the determination by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services on February 4, 2020, that there is a public health emergency that has a significant potential to affect national security or the health and security of United States citizens living abroad, and then issued declarations that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of unapproved products, the FDA may issue an EUA to allow unapproved medical products or unapproved uses of approved medical products to be used in an emergency to diagnose, treat, or prevent COVID-19 when there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives.  The issuance of an EUA is different than an FDA approval (licensure) of a vaccine. In determining whether to issue an EUA for a product, the FDA evaluates the available evidence and assesses any known or potential risks and any known or potential benefits, and if the benefit-risk assessment is favorable, the product is made available during the emergency. Once a manufacturer submits an EUA request for a COVID-19 vaccine to the FDA, the agency then evaluates the request and determines whether the relevant statutory criteria are met, taking into account the totality of the scientific evidence about the vaccine that is available to the FDA.  The EUA also requires that fact sheets that provide important information, including dosing instructions, and information about the benefits and risks of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, be made available to vaccination providers and vaccine recipients.  The company has submitted a pharmacovigilance plan to FDA to monitor the safety of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. The pharmacovigilance plan includes a plan to complete longer-term safety follow-up for participants enrolled in ongoing clinical trials. The pharmacovigilance plan also includes other activities aimed at monitoring the safety profile of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and ensuring that any safety concerns are identified and evaluated in a timely manner.  The FDA also expects manufacturers whose COVID-19 vaccines are authorized under an EUA to continue their clinical trials to obtain additional safety and effectiveness information and pursue approval (licensure).  The EUA for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine was issued to Pfizer Inc. The EUA will be effective until the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of the emergency use of drugs and biologics for prevention and treatment of COVID-19 is terminated, and may be revised or revoked if it is determined the EUA no longer meets the statutory criteria for issuance.  The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.

499,58860254526197656014709087064307479144,"(CNN) President Joe Biden hosted Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga at the White House on Friday for his first in-person meeting with a foreign leader as he refocuses American foreign policy toward East Asia.  The meeting between the two leaders came at the end of a pivotal week for the Biden administration's foreign policy, marked by Wednesday's announcement that the President will remove US troops from Afghanistan by September 11 and Thursday's announcement of sanctions on Russia for election interference and cyber attacks. Those moves are a part of the President's desire to shift the country's foreign policy focus to East Asia and counter a rising China.  Biden and Suga said they both aimed to tighten the relationship between the two countries during the daylong visit, and China was one of the biggest focuses of the day's meetings.  ""We committed to working together to take on the challenges from China and on issues like the East China Sea, the South China Sea, as well as North Korea, to ensure the future of a free and open Indo-Pacific,"" Biden said during remarks in the Rose Garden of the White House on Friday.  Suga said he and Biden had ""serious talks on China's influence over the peace and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific, and the world at large.""  ""We agreed to oppose any attempts to change the status quo by force or coercion in the East and South China Seas and intimidation of others in the region,"" Suga said. ""At the same time, we agreed on the necessity for each of us to engage in frank dialogue with China, and in so doing, to pursue stability of international relations, while upholding universal values.""  China sent 25 warplanes into Taiwan's air defense identification zone on Monday, which was the largest breach of that space since the island began regularly reporting such activity in September, Taiwan's Defense Ministry said.  The fact that Suga was the first foreign leader to pay a visit to the White House showed the importance of the relationship between the two countries in promoting democracy in the region, Biden said earlier in the day.  ""As you know, this is the first foreign leader to visit me in my presidency and I'm really pleased to welcome such a close ally and good partner,"" Biden said during a bilateral meeting in the State Dining Room at the White House.  Suga opened his remarks at that meeting by acknowledging the shooting in Indianapolis that left eight people dead overnight, saying through a translator that ""innocent citizens must not be exposed to any such violence.""  The Prime Minister said the two countries have a bond over their shared values and he was looking to ""reaffirm the new and tight bond between us.""  ""I wish to spend time with you to, again, confirm the close ties between our two countries. And thank you again for accepting us,"" Suga said.  During the news conference later in the afternoon, Biden mentioned partnerships with Japan on technology, making sure the technologies are shared and set by democracies, not autocracies, in a nod to China.  ""We're going to work together to prove that democracies can still compete and win in the 21st Century,"" he said.  Suga said during the news conference that the two leaders discussed issues related to Taiwan and Xinjiang during their meetings.  ""As we engaged in an exchange of views over the regional situation, we also discussed the circumstances in Taiwan and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region as well,"" the Prime Minister said, according to a live translation.  ""I refrain from mentioning details since it pertains to diplomatic exchanges, but there is already an agreed recognition over the importance of peace and stability of the Taiwan strait between Japan and the United States, which was reaffirmed on this occasion. I also explained Japan's position and initiatives regarding the situation in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region to the President, who I think understood my points,"" he added.  The two leaders also discussed North Korea, as the US is nearing the conclusion of its North Korea policy review.  While Japan has been consulted throughout the process, the two leaders had an opportunity to ""put the finishing touches on what is an important initiative for the United States,"" a senior official said ahead of the meeting.  National security adviser Jake Sullivan recently met with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts in Annapolis, Maryland, in order to discuss the administration's North Korea policy review. The review included extensive consultations with members of the Trump administration about diplomatic engagements with North Korea.  ""The United States can only be effective in Asia when the US-Japan relationship is strong and Japan is steady and stable,"" the official said.  This story and its headline have been updated with further developments Friday.",Biden uses meeting with Japanese Prime Minister to emphasize new focus on China,true

Ten lives have been lost, and more families have been shattered by gun violence in the state of Colorado. And Jill and I are devastated, and the feeling, I just can’t imagine how the families are feeling. The victims, whose futures were stolen from them, from their families, from their loved ones, who now have to struggle to go on and try to make sense of what’s happened. While we’re still waiting for more information regarding the shooter, his motive, the weapons he used, the guns, the magazines, the weapons, the modifications that apparently have taken place to those weapons that are involved here — I don’t need to wait another minute, let alone an hour, to take common sense steps that’ll save the lives in the future and to urge my colleagues in the House and Senate to act. We can ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines in this country once again. I got that done when I was a senator, it passed it was the law for the longest time. And it brought down these mass killings. We should do it again. While addressing the nation on Tuesday after a shooting at a grocery store in Colorado, President Biden made a plea for stricter gun laws across the country. Credit Credit... Anna Moneymaker for The New York Times  President Biden said Tuesday that he was “devastated” by the killing of 10 people at a grocery store in Boulder, Colo., and called on Congress not to “wait another minute” in enacting legislation to ban assault rifles and high-capacity ammunition magazines.  “This is not and should not be a partisan issue — it is an American issue,” a somber Mr. Biden said in brief remarks delivered in the State Dining Room at the White House. “We have to act.”  Mr. Biden would not comment on the details of the attack on Monday but said he had spoken to Gov. Jared Polis of Colorado, Attorney General Merrick B. Garland and the F.B.I. director, Christopher A. Wray, and would continue his consultations during a flight to Columbus, Ohio, in the afternoon.  “Jill and I are devastated. The feeling — I just can’t imagine how the families are feeling,” he said, at times struggling to find the right words.  Mr. Biden then left for a trip to promote his $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package, hoping to keep the focus on the benefits of the stimulus and promoting the 11th anniversary of the signing of the Affordable Care Act. While he is in Ohio, President Biden is also scheduled to meet with Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, to discuss coronavirus vaccinations and other matters related to the pandemic.  The attack in Colorado, in which a gunman killed 10 people, including a police officer, came less than a week after another gunman murdered eight people in Atlanta. The back-to-back killings amounted to a return of mass casualty shootings that had seemed, for a time, to be suppressed by pandemic lockdowns.  Mr. Biden noted that he had to draft a proclamation on Monday to keep — not lower — the White House flags to half-staff, because they had already been lowered to honor the victims in Atlanta.  “Another American city has been scarred by gun violence and the resulting trauma,” he said.  Earlier, Vice President Kamala Harris, speaking at an event in Washington, praised the “heroism” of Eric Talley, an officer killed while responding to the shooting.  Mr. Biden also praised the officer’s efforts and offered his condolences to his “close, close family” of seven children.  “When he pinned on that badge yesterday morning he didn’t know what the day would bring. I want everybody to think about this,” Mr. Biden said.  Mr. Biden has had a long, and at times frustrating, history of pushing gun control proposals. He was tasked with coming up with a legislative package of gun control measures by President Barack Obama after the Sandy Hook killings of 2012 but the effort resulted in no significant legislative action, and Mr. Obama was forced to enact a handful of relatively modest reform through executive actions.  Mr. Biden had not made gun control a legislative priority during the first weeks of his presidency, but his tone on Wednesday seemed to signal a shift.  He called on the Senate to quickly pass two House bills, passed earlier this year and first introduced after the 2018 mass shooting at a Parkland, Fla., high school, that extend background checks to private sellers and extend the time limit to conduct checks on purchasers.  Mr. Biden said it was wrong “to wait another minute, let alone an hour, to take common-sense steps that will save lives in the future.”  Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, later told reporters aboard Air Force One that the recent shooting did not change Mr. Biden’s position on overhauling the filibuster.  “He, of course, believes that we should work with Democrats and Republicans to get work done for the American people, including common-sense gun safety measures,” Ms. Psaki said. “He’s also open to hearing ideas. He is not going to allow for obstruction to get work done for the American people. But his preference and priority is working with members of both parties.”",Biden Urges Action on Gun Control After 2 Mass Shootings in Less Than a Week,true
501,128650326129407756565017217296742467441,"House Speaker Brian Egolf  STATE News:  SANTA FE — Legislation to repeal the state’s abortion ban, which criminalizes health care providers, passed the Health and Human Services Committee Wednesday with bipartisan support.  House Bill 7 is sponsored by Speaker of the House Brian Egolf (D-Santa Fe),  Rep. Micaela Lara Cadena (D-Mesilla), Rep. Joanne Ferrary (D-Las Cruces), Rep. Deborah Armstrong (D-Albuquerque) and Rep. Georgene Louis (D-Albuquerque).  “House Bill 7 simply repeals the outdated and dangerous abortion ban of 1969 that was designed to keep New Mexicans from accessing the health care they may need,” Rep. Cadena said. “Pregnant people and their families deserve continued access to safe and legal abortion. By repealing this dangerous statute, we are making sure this ban is never enforceable in New Mexico again.”  “Abortion is health care, and all New Mexicans have a right to health care without politics interfering and without fear or penalty,” Rep. Ferrary said. “Medical decisions, especially those regarding reproductive care, are deeply personal and complex and should be made between a woman, her family and her doctor, to be guided by her own faith and values.”  “The majority of New Mexicans believe that a woman’s right to make her own decisions about reproductive health care, including abortion, should be protected. New Mexicans support abortion access and trust each other to make their own decisions,” Speaker Egolf said. “With HB 7, we’re making sure that no matter what happens in Washington, DC, New Mexicans will always be able to make their own health care decisions.”  The 1969 New Mexico abortion ban became unenforceable following the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision; however, it is still in New Mexico state statute. HB 7 is a repeal of the 1969 ban, ensuring that these dangerous restrictions on reproductive health care will not be enforced in New Mexico should Roe v. Wade be overturned by a future Supreme Court.  House Bill 7 passed committee with a bipartisan 8-3 vote, and will now be heard in the House Judiciary Committee.  Members of the public can track legislation on the New Mexico Legislature website and access committee meetings and House floor sessions on the Webcasts tab. During the 2021 Legislative Session, the House of Representatives is focused on passing critical legislation while protecting the health and safety of the public, the staff, and the legislators.",HB 7 To Repeal Abortion Ban Passes Bipartisan Committee,true

By Eric O’Keefe  Call it a hunch, but the story did not jibe. I scanned the headline for the umpteenth time and then read and reread the pertinent details. Something was missing. Either that or I had a screw loose. According to reporting by Wendy Culverwell in the Tri-City Herald, a 14,500-acre swath of choice Eastern Washington farmland in the Horse Heaven Hills of Benton County had just traded hands for almost $171 million. That’s a ginormous deal, one that pencils out to almost $12,000 per acre for a whole lot of acres. Pretty pricey dirt, right? That’s exactly what I thought. Especially when it comes to row crops like sweet corn and wheat, which are grown in rotation with potatoes on 100 Circles, which is the name of the property that changed hands. Then again, farmers and investors in the Mid-Columbia River market expect to pay $10,000 to $15,000 for good ground. Anyone who has ever studied the Columbia River Basin knows that the tillable acreage there is coveted ground, a geologic wonder. The soil profile and underlying silty loess are in a league of their own.  I had gained this smidgen of geologic proficiency while researching our 2018 Farmland Deal of the Year, Weidert Farm, in neighboring Walla Walla County. One of the most telling moments in the field that summer came when a soil scientist by the name of Alan Busacca grabbed a shovel and stepped into a 10-foot trench that had been ripped open on the farm by a Caterpillar 336. Dusky layers of silt and sand towered over the 6-foot-tall retired Washington State professor. There wasn’t a rock, let alone a pebble, or even a root to be seen in the soil. Busacca was in his element: It was some of the richest farmland in the Lower 48. And from an agricultural perspective, the region surrounding Walla Walla and the Horse Heaven Hills has evolved into a commercial hub, complete with controlled atmosphere (CA) storage, state-of-the-art transportation infrastructure, and ready access to low-cost hydropower.  These are a few of the reasons why savvy investors have been plowing millions of dollars into farmland on both the Oregon and the Washington sides of the Columbia River Gorge. At current valuations, it’s one of the nation’s best farmland opportunities. In 2018, when 100 Circles sold, it was even better.  More often than not, farmland sales involve hundreds of acres. Thousand-acre transactions — such as the sale of 6,000- acre Weidert Farm to Farmland L.P. two years ago and the 6,175-acre Broetje Orchards acquisition by the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan last year — are blue-moon events.  Tens of thousands of acres? Only sovereign wealth funds and institutional investors can stroke a check for tracts in that league, which is exactly what occurred on the sell side of the 100 Circles transaction: The seller was John Hancock Life Insurance, a multibillion-dollar asset manager with key holdings in all the major US markets as well as Canada and Australia.  The story went dark on the buy side, however. The Tri-City Herald reported that the purchaser was a “Louisiana investor,” a limited liability company associated with Angelina Agriculture of Monterey, Louisiana. Sorry, but that didn’t pass the sniff test.  The Land Report tracks numerous Louisiana landowners; Angelina Agriculture is not one of them. Let’s call that strike one. The burgeoning metropolis of Monterey, population 462, rang a bell, but despite my best efforts, I couldn’t connect the dots to anyone whom we had profiled in The Land Report or, for that matter, anyone who was on our watch list. So I took a look at Dun & Bradstreet. At its listed headquarters — 8318 Highway 565 — Angelina Agriculture boasted two employees and reported annual revenues just north of $300,000. Given the size and cost of 100 Circles, both of those figures made no sense at all. Strike two. How about Google Maps? An aerial image of the Highway 565 address revealed a small metal-sided building off by itself in the woods. Strike three, right?  One of my favorite Clint Eastwood movies is the 1999 mystery/thriller True Crime. In it, the four-time Academy Award winner plays an over-the-hill journalist who has “a nose” for a story. I am quite confident that Eastwood’s character, Steve Everett, would have picked up the stench from this setup a mile off: a $171 million acquisition by an LLC with two employees in a metal-sided building down a dirt road off the Bayou Cocodrie? I forwarded the lead to our Land Report 100 Research Team. Minutes later, a terse response arrived:  “Ever hear of Bill Gates?”  THE PAPER TRAIL  Actually, when it comes to the extensive farmland portfolio of Bill and Melinda Gates, the question should be, “Ever hear of Michael Larson?” For the last 25 years, the Claremont McKenna College alum has managed the Gateses’ personal portfolio as well as the considerable holdings of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. (Although our researchers identified dozens of different entities that own the Gateses’ assets, Larson himself operates primarily through an entity called Cascade Investment LLC.)  In 1994, the Gateses hired the former Putnam Investments bond-fund manager to diversify the couple’s portfolio away from the Microsoft co-founder’s 45 percent stake in the technology giant while maintaining comparable or better returns. According to a 2014 profile of Larson in the Wall Street Journal, these investments include a substantial stake in AutoNation, hospitality interests such as the Charles Hotel in Cambridge and the Four Seasons in San Francisco, and “at least 100,000 acres of farmland in California, Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, and other states … .” According to the Land Report 100 Research Team, that figure is currently more than twice that amount, which means Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft, has an alter ego: Farmer Bill, the guy who owns more farmland than anyone else in America.  The Gateses’ largest single block of dirt was acquired in 2017: a group of farmland assets owned by the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. Based in Toronto, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board began assembling an agricultural portfolio in 2013, when it acquired AgCoA, aka, Agricultural Company of America. This private US farmland REIT was a joint venture between Duquesne Capital Management and Goldman Sachs that launched in 2007. Over the next five years, AgCoA acquired more than 100,000 acres in nine states. By the time it was sold to the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board in 2013, AgCoA ranked as one of the leading institutional owners of row crop farmland in the US.  After AgCoA, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board acquired a second tranche of farmland assets when it paid $2.5 billion for a 40 percent stake in Glencore Agricultural Products in 2016. The very next year, however, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board began shedding these very same farmland assets as quickly as it had acquired them. And it did this so quietly one might even say it was done in secret.  There was no public announcement, and no notice in the business press. Instead, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board revealed in the fine print of a quarterly statement that it had sold $520 million in US farmland assets held by Agriculture Company of America. Credit Chris Janiec at Agri Investor for this eagle-eyed investigating. The Americas Editor at Agri Investor, Janiec reported that the assets had been offered as a single block and “that Microsoft founder Bill Gates is thought to be the buyer of CPPIB’s farmland.” Janiec stayed on the story, and the following year, he confirmed the parameters of sale when he reported the addition of 61 properties valued at approximately $500 million to the National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries’ (NCREIF) US Farmland Index. This half-billion-dollar figure corroborated the AgCoA acquisition, and the paper trail led directly to Cascade Investment LLC.  All told, the 2017 acquisition of AgCoA and the 2018 acquisition of the 100 Circles tract in the Horse Heaven Hills of Eastern Washington total an investment in farmland assets of more than $690 million. Janiec’s sources said some of the AgCoA assets were quickly sold off, but according to the Land Report 100 Research Team, an estimated 242,000 acres of farmland remained.  Yet farmland assets aren’t the sole component of the Gateses’ landholdings. In 2017, Cascade Investment bought a “significant stake” in 24,800 acres of transitional land on the western edge of Phoenix, the most populous city in Arizona and the 10th largest metropolitan area in the country. The acreage sits off Interstate 10, and it is poised to be accessible by Interstate 11, a proposed highway that would traverse 5 miles of the 40-square-mile holding. At buildout, the Belmont development will create a brand-new metropolis, one similar in size to the Phoenix suburb of Tempe, home to Arizona State University and almost 200,000 residents. According to The Arizona Republic, Belmont is projected to include up to 80,000 homes; 3,800 acres of industrial, office, and retail space; 3,400 acres of open space; and 470 acres for public schools.  Cascade Investment doubled down on Phoenix transitional land two years later when it made a second major investment by acquiring more than 2,800 acres known as Spurlock Ranch in Buckeye for $25 million.  SUSTAINABLE INVESTING  A spokesman for Cascade Investment declined to comment on any of the details associated with these transactions or the Gateses’ holdings, other than to say that Cascade is very supportive of sustainable farming.  Much like the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation uses science and technology to achieve a number of worthy goals — including transitioning millions of people out of poverty, improving people’s health and well-being, and ensuring that all people have access to opportunities necessary to succeed in school and in life — Cascade’s farmland holdings also aim to further laudable objectives.  In January 2020, The Land Report announced the launch of a sustainability standard that was developed by US farmland owners and operators. Called Leading Harvest, the organization’s goal is to create a sustainability standard that can be implemented across the greatest swath of agricultural acreage. Currently, more than 2 million acres in 22 states and an additional 2 million acres in seven countries are represented. Among the participants in the 13-member Sustainable Agriculture Working Group are Ceres Partners, Hancock Natural Resources Group, The Rohaytn Group, and UBS Farmland Investors.  Not surprisingly, one of Leading Harvest’s other inaugural members is a Cascade entity called Cottonwood Ag Management. Committing the resources to launch this all-important standard validates the assertion that Cascade supports sustainable strategies that advance resiliency and efficiency, retain talent, and reduce regulatory burdens.  Although the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has no ties whatsoever to Cascade or its investments, it also has a farmland initiative: Gates Ag One, which has established its headquarters in the Greater St. Louis area. According to the St. Louis Business Journal, Gates Ag One will focus on research that helps “smallholder farmers adapt to climate change and make food production in low- and middle-income countries more productive, resilient, and sustainable.”  A CLOSING NOTE  Remember that metal-sided building down near the Bayou Cocodrie? Turns out that very same property had caught my eye way back when The Land Report was preparing to launch in 2006. Does the name Bernie Ebbers ring a bell? Once upon a time, the business press dubbed the colorful entrepreneur “the telecom cowboy.” That was before the Edmonton native was put on trial for his role in what was, at the time, the largest corporate bankruptcy filing in US history.  In 2005, the former WorldCom CEO was convicted of securities fraud, conspiracy, and filing false reports that were instrumental in WorldCom’s $11 billion dollar accounting fraud. After losing his appeal in 2006, Ebbers spent most of the rest of his life in a federal prison before being granted compassionate release by a federal judge in 2020. He died at home surrounded by his family.  Ebbers was many things — a dreamer, a liar, a swindler — and he loved land. In 1998 when he was the toast of Wall Street, the telecom cowboy paid British Columbia’s Woodward family the astronomical sum of $73 million for Canada’s largest ranch: 500,000-acre Douglas Lake, a 22,000-head cattle operation. Ebbers subsequently pledged Douglas Lake as collateral for $400 million he ended up borrowing from WorldCom, and in 2003, WorldCom sold Douglas Lake to Kroenke Ranches. The $68.5 million that Kroenke Ranches paid was applied to Ebbers’s IOU. He also owned a 26,236-acre Louisiana farm. It, too, was sold, on September 25, 2006, the day before Ebbers began serving his sentence at the Oakdale Federal Correctional Institution. It was his last deal as a free man.  When Ebbers owned this Louisiana farm, it was known as Angelina Plantation. And its headquarters was in — you guessed it — Monterey, Louisiana. That was the missing piece of the puzzle I had been searching for as I read the Tri-City Herald story. In a former life, Angelina Agriculture, the purchaser that paid $171 million for 100 Circles in 2018, was, in fact, Bernie Ebbers’s Angelina Plantation. The day before he went to prison, Ebbers sold Angelina for $32 million. The farm was subsequently sold to AgCoA, which was acquired by the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. In 2017, Angelina Plantation changed hands one more time and became one of the principal farmland assets in the Gateses’ Cascade Investment’s portfolio.  It took a dozen years, but the ownership of that Louisiana farmland went from Bernie Ebbers to Bill Gates with a couple of stops in between.

Richard Trinh) VIEW ORIGINAL  WASHINGTON – Behind a serving line inside the District of Columbia National Guard’s armory, empty boxes that once contained warm meals quickly stacked up, forming a small hill of cardboard and ripped Scotch tape.  For Spc. Venice Cephas, it was a clear sign that Soldiers and Airmen were consuming food at a rapid pace.  It was also a sign that Cephas and other food-service specialists with the D.C. Guard were working at lightning speed — labeling food, ensuring it’s safe to eat, replenishing stock, properly disposing of garbage, and moving troops through the serving line quickly.  “This takes commitment,” she said, reflecting on her contributions to the National Guard’s mission to protect the Capitol after the presidential inauguration. “But it feels good, [because] I do it for my child, I do it for the country, I do it for the people of this good nation, and I do it for my comrades.”  Though the number of Guard members supporting the mission have dropped to about 7,900 since the inauguration, the care and morale of Guard members remains a top priority.  Army Lt. Col. Sekou Richardson, the acting logistics deputy director for the D.C. Guard Joint Task Force, described the operation’s logistical efforts as providing “creature comforts” for visiting Guard members.  “We try to make D.C. their ‘home field away from home,’” he said. “It’s our job as leaders to make sure that not only are they not bored, but that they are cared for and there are options for them when not on duty.”  One example of this, Richardson said, is coordinating with the United Services Organization to provide video gaming centers inside the armory — the staging point for operations.  “It keeps our morale up because it brings stress relief from the situation out here, giving us space and the opportunity to get away from whatever we are doing when we have free time,” said Spc. Devante Fairnot, a combat engineer with the Virginia Army National Guard’s Company A, 229th Brigade Engineer Battalion.  Competing in the digital worlds of professional football, caged fighting or futuristic warfare, he said, enhances camaraderie.  “Hanging out with my battle buddies here is a great way to close out the day,” Fairnot said.  The quick downloads of the video games Guard members like Fairnot play come from the efforts of communication teams provided by the National Guard Bureau.  Army Maj. Robert Killian, a California Army National Guard member serving as a signals liaison officer for the NGB, said his team has worked with the USO and telecommunications companies to put in additional bandwidth.  “We were on the (armory’s) drill floor and we were testing like a 125 ‘megs’ to a cell phone, which isn’t that bad for how many people were on it,” said Killian.  Additionally, he said, NGB pushed out portable broadband devices to Guard members at certain Capitol Hill-area locations that improved operational communications and helped troops meet training requirements via video conference platforms.  The real benefit, however, is providing Guard members the means to reach out to family and others during the mission — something Killian said he’s all too familiar with.  “That’s the most important thing for me because I’m away from my wife and my kids,” he said. “Providing (Guard members) that extra bandwidth, and helping to facilitate that, is the biggest contribution I can make.”  While family may be only a phone call, text or email away, Soldiers and Airmen needing religious or spiritual guidance relied on Guard chaplains.  “We are here to ensure that Soldiers and Airmen have the opportunity to freely practice their faith,” said Army Lt. Col. Bob Patton, senior chaplain for the D.C. JTF.  While chaplains are used to providing ministry engagements and counseling services, Patton said the coronavirus pandemic has presented some challenges.  “We are asking them to be creative in their approaches and how they do their work to support Soldiers and Airmen,” he said, adding that could include visits on the streets or reaching out by telephone.  In the end, Patton said the mission of making sure Soldiers and Airmen remain healthy mentally and spiritually does not let up — despite the COVID-19 threat.  “All that has done is forced us to operate outside of our normal paradigms,” he said. “But (Guard chaplains) are still accomplishing our mission, and still meeting the needs of our Soldiers and Airmen.”  Part of those needs also involves ensuring Guard members receive adequate lodging.  “(Guard) representatives from each state come to us and we allocate what number of rooms they need and we fill them — through hotels in D.C., Maryland, and Virginia,” said Air Force Capt. Matt Duller, an officer in charge of a D.C. JTF lodging unit. “We have contracted out thousands of (hotel) rooms.”  It’s a Herculean task for his unit, he added, and one that involves making constant inquiries and anticipating potential issues.  “It’s that turnover (of troops) that we are having to deal with — trying to figure out when they are leaving, is their plane going to be delayed, is the weather going to be an issue; and when that lodging contract ends, are there enough (rooms) to actually hold the people who are still here and the ones who are coming,” Duller explained. “It’s just making sure that troops are where they are supposed to be because it’s such a big operation.”  For the DC JTF’s acting logistics deputy director, meeting all the morale and welfare needs of Guard members during a large-scale operation can be summed up in a few words.  “We remain flexible and agile,” Richardson said, “as we encounter any challenge.”  For more National Guard news  National Guard Facebook  National Guard Twitter  59th Presidential Inauguration",Morale efforts sustain Guard members during DC mission,true

A pandemic of the novel coronavirus has now killed more than 1 million people worldwide.  Over 38.8 million people across the globe have been diagnosed with COVID-19, the disease caused by the new respiratory virus, according to data compiled by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. The criteria for diagnosis -- through clinical means or a lab test -- has varied from country-to-country. Still, the actual numbers are believed to be much higher due to testing shortages, many unreported cases and suspicions that some national governments are hiding or downplaying the scope of their outbreaks.

The United States is the worst-affected country, with more than 7.9 million diagnosed cases and at least 217,721 deaths.  California has the most cases of any U.S. state, with more than 866,000 people diagnosed, according to Johns Hopkins data.

Bush, with the latter requesting a continuance to gather exculpatory evidence.  Counselors of the law firm Williams & Conolly arrived at Guantanamo Bay Friday, five days ahead of Bush’s tribunal date, arguing that the military had given them inadequate time to prepare a defense. Senior Counsel David D. Aufhauser asserted Bush’s innocence but demanded an additional 90 days to prepare a rebuttal to, what he called, the military’s specious allegations. Moreover, they said JAG’s seizure of documents and electronic devices from Bush’s Crawford ranch violated his 4th Amendment rights, and, therefore, ought to be inadmissible in courts of law.  Lt. Dawn Cusumano, a junior member of JAG’s National Security Litigation team, noted that Bush’s arrest took place on 11 November, giving his legal team nearly a month to mount a defense, and asked why, if Bush were innocent, they needed three more months.  “Because your office has fabricated flagrantly bogus charges on our client,” Aufhauser said.  “Mr. Aufhauser, if you’re prepared to accuse our offices of manufacturing evidence to wrongfully prosecute your client, well, those are serious allegations, ones you should be prepared to back up. Rear Adm. Crandall is patient, but he doesn’t tolerate foolery,” Lt. Cusumano said.

We’re not obligated to, and what we have shared, we’ve done for professional courtesy,” Lt. Cusumano replied.  Aufhauser then asked to speak with Rear Adm.

Ganzert, president and CEO of American Humane, the country’s first national humane organization, today released the following statement concerning the plight of contract working dogs left to die at the hands of American enemies in Kabul, Afghanistan.  “I am devastated by reports that the American government is pulling out of Kabul and leaving behind brave U.S. military contract working dogs to be tortured and killed at the hand of our enemies. These brave dogs do the same dangerous, lifesaving work as our military working dogs, and deserved a far better fate than the one to which they have been condemned.  This senseless fate is made all the more tragic, as American Humane stands ready to not only help transport these contract K-9 soldiers to U.S. soil but also to provide for their lifetime medical care.  American Humane has worked hand in hand with the military for more than 100 years to rescue military animals. In fact, our famed rescue program began on the bloody battlefields of WWI Europe, at the request of the U.S. Secretary of War. Since that time, American Humane served as a pioneer in the development of animal therapy for returning veterans, and today brings home retired military working dogs and pairs veterans with life-saving service dogs.  As the country’s first national humane organization and largest certifier of animal welfare in the world, it sickens us to sit idly by and watch these brave dogs who valiantly served our country be put to death or worse.  In order to prevent this tragedy from occurring, these K-9’s should be loaded into whatever cargo space remains and flown to safety.  Irrespective of the outcome, this gross oversight of justice must be stopped from happening again, as it did in Vietnam too. To that end, we call on Congress to take action to classify contract working dogs on the same level as military working dogs.

The new report comes as the Trump administration makes it harder for Central Americans to seek refuge here. (AP Photo/Eduardo Verdugo, File)  WASHINGTON (AP) — At least 138 people deported to El Salvador from the United States in recent years were subsequently killed, Human Rights Watch says in a report that comes as the Trump administration makes it harder for Central Americans to seek refuge here.  A majority of the deaths documented by Human Rights Watch in the report Wednesday occurred less than a year after the deportees returned to El Salvador; some were within days. The organization also confirmed at least 70 cases of sexual assault or other violence following their arrival in the country.  The violence underscores the risk faced by people forced to return by U.S. law that mandates deportation of noncitizens convicted of a range of crimes and Trump administration policies that discourage asylum-seekers, said Alison Leal Parker, the group’s U.S. managing director.  ADVERTISEMENT  “Our concern is that many of these people are facing a death sentence,” Parker said.  Between 2014 and 2018 the U.S. deported about 111,000 Salvadorans back to their homeland, which has long been in the grip of fierce gang violence.  The. United Nations reported last year that killings in El Salvador, a majority of them linked to gang conflict, have declined from a peak of more than 6,000 in 2015. But the country still has one of the highest homicide rates in the world.  Meanwhile, the number of Salvadorans seeking asylum in the United States grew by nearly 1,000% between 2012 and 2017, many citing threats from gangs. Only about 18% are granted asylum.  Human Rights Watch confirmed the 138 deaths during that period through official records, interviews with families and media accounts but believes the actual toll is much higher, in part because some aren’t recorded due to the stigma of having been deported from the U.S. The number of assaults is likely low also because of under-reporting in the country of 6.5 million.  El Salvador’s foreign ministerm Alexandra Hill Tinocom told reporters that at least some of those killed were gang members, though she conceded that deportees do face stigma in the country.  She blamed gang rivalries for the violence that plagues the country, and avoided a direct answer when asked about allegations in the report that police officers have killed deportees who are suspected gang members.  “Look, we have to take everything in context,” she said. “Gangs kill children, they dismember people, they terrorize communities and we are working hard, very hard against them.”  The deaths tracked in the study occurred under both the Trump and Obama administrations. President Donald Trump has made immigration enforcement a centerpiece of his administration, and that has included a policy of forcing asylum-seekers from Central America to wait in Mexico while their claims are evaluated and be sent back to their homelands if their claim is rejected.  Many of those asylum-seekers could previously have been released on parole in the United States for a decision that could take a year or more. The Department of Homeland Security says it’s trying to make the process more efficient and crack down on fraudulent claims.  “This report is a shameful reminder of the Trump administration’s xenophobic policy of denying meaningful protection to vulnerable families fleeing a certain death in their home countries,” said Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., in a statement.  Parker and other critics of the administration’s immigration policy say this report, and previous efforts that have documented violence against Salvadorans waiting in Mexican border towns for their claims to be processed, show the risks of the Trump administration policy.  Full Coverage: El Salvador  “We are deeply concerned by the Trump administration’s effort to literally eviscerate the right to seek asylum in the United States,” she said.  Human Rights Watch urged the administration to repeal the policy that requires asylum-seekers to wait in Mexico along with the agreements that allow Guatemalans, Salvadorans and Hondurans to be settled in other countries of Central America while seeking refuge. They also want the attorney general to reverse restrictions that made it harder for them to claim U.S. asylum because of threats posed by gangs or gender-based violence.  ___  Associated Press writer Marcos Aleman in San Salvador, El Salvador, contributed to this report.",Report: At least 138 sent from US to El Salvador were killed,true
510,110714168274541579122318630866245828745,"The “private sale” loophole became a leading talking point for gun reform advocates following the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in December 2012. President Barack Obama’s call for congressional action to close the gap led to the ultimately unsuccessful push for the 2013 Manchin-Toomey bill, the most serious bipartisan federal safety legislation in a decade. Fierce debate over how — or why — to do so continued into the 2016 presidential campaign, when the Democratic party platform endorsed “universal background checks” and Republicans remained opposed to any gun regulations, claiming “gun rights.” But as the two sides clashed, the fact at the center of the policy fight itself came under dispute: Just how large is that loophole?  The answer: Smaller than we thought. For nearly two decades, the best estimate was that 40 percent of gun transfers did not involve a background check. But a new, larger study puts that number at only 22 percent. The estimate comes from a new national survey reported in the January issue of The Annals of Internal Medicine.  And, perhaps unexpectedly, the updated figure actually strengthens the case for a national, universal background check law.  The private sale loophole, often misleadingly referred to as the “gun-show” loophole, was a byproduct of the 1993 Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act. The law imposed a federal requirement on retail gun dealers that they conduct a criminal background check before transferring a gun to a customer. Since the full implementation of background checks in 1998, it has blocked upwards of 3 million sales to would-be buyers who were found to have a felony conviction or other disqualifying condition. But the background check requirement does not extend to private transactions, and currently only 19 states have background check laws that go beyond the federal minimum.  Advocates for a federal universal background check law have been handicapped by lack of data on the firearms market. The last time there was a national survey that asked about gun transactions was in 1994 — before background checks were fully implemented. It was known as the National Survey on the Private Ownership of Firearms (NSPOF), and I ran the study and analyzed the resulting data with Jens Ludwig, now director of the Chicago Crime Lab.  In the paper we published based on the survey, we reported that about 60 percent of all gun transactions at that time were purchases from retail dealers. The remaining 40 percent were private transactions.  Nearly 20 years later, the 40 percent figure became prominent when advocates began using it as the best available estimate for the size of the private sale loophole.  Good advocacy abhors a data vacuum, and the new survey has helped to fill this one. Conducted by Matthew Miller, Deborah Azrael and colleagues, the new research finally provides a wholly applicable measure of the main background check loophole. And its implication is that nationwide, we are functionally closer to having a universal background check in place than previously thought. Should Congress someday consider an expanded background check mandate, it would pose much less of an imposition on the gun-buying public. For advocates, 22 percent is better than 40 percent.  Meanwhile, what has always been true is that universal background checks target the kind of transactions that arm violent offenders. Surveys of people convicted of shootings have consistently found that they rarely buy their guns from a store; instead, they obtain them from family, acquaintances, or on the street. But because there is no federal law that requires background checks for these types of informal transactions, sellers who supply criminals with weapons don’t have to worry about the risk of being prosecuted in most states.  Many in the broader gun violence research community endorse universal background checks for those reasons, although systematic evaluations have had mixed results. The New York Times recently polled a number of knowledgeable people on an array of firearms policies might help reduce gun deaths: Universal background checks for gun purchasers was the policy deemed most effective by the group. For the same article, the newspaper polled the general public about which gun violence preventions they could most support. Consistent with earlier surveys, the Times found that 85 percent of voters support such a law.  The new study presents some other data points of note. The one that most caught my attention was that the breakdown of firearms transactions itself has not changed very much in the two decades since our 1994 analysis. The 2015 data shows that 64 percent of gun sales went through a licensed retailer — a negligible difference from the 60 percent we found two decades ago. Additionally, even as several states have passed expanded background checks in the years since Sandy Hook, the overall proportion of the total U.S. adult population covered by laws requiring checks for private transactions has not changed enough since the Brady Act was fully implemented for that to account for a meaningfully smaller private-sale loophole.  Rather, we now know that it was never as large as some claimed — just plenty wide enough to let most violent offenders through.

511,337654308993089772092659125212014956838,"The UK’s new Trade Agreements: Curb your Enthusiasm  Share this article:  8 November 2021  L. Alan Winters is Professor of Economics and Founding Director of the UKTP0 and Guillermo Larbalestier is Research Assistant in International Trade at the University of Sussex and Fellow of the UKTPO.  Key Findings:  To date, the UK government has signed no new trade agreements relative to what it would have had as a continuing member of the EU.  The Government estimates that the two agreements in principle announced this year (Australia and New Zealand) will increase UK Gross Domestic Product by between £200 and £500 million annually – that is, 0.01% to 0.02% (one to two ten-thousandths) of GDP or between £3 and £7 per head of population – and that only after they have bedded down over 15 years or so .  We were asked to sum up the economic benefits of the UK’s new post-Brexit trade agreements. Our first observation is that if we take as a starting point the trade agreements that the UK would have been party to as a member of the EU, the government has, to date, signed no new trade agreements!  There are two new trade agreements in principle. That with Australia was announced in June 2021 but has not yet been finalised, and that with New Zealand was announced last month. As the full details of these agreements have not yet been released (or perhaps determined), we do not know what their effects will be, but in June and July 2020 the government’s preliminary analysis (which is not likely to be an underestimate of the worth of the agreements) suggested that in the long run, the trade deal with Australia will raise UK GDP by between £200 and £500 million annually – that is, 0.01% to 0.02% (one to two ten-thousandths) of GDP or between £3 and £7 per head of population. The trade agreement with New Zealand is estimated to raise GDP by basically zero – minus 0.01% to plus 0.01%. (The long run ‘is generally assumed to represent around 15 years from implementation of the agreement.’)  Government analysis also treats the agreement with Japan (the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement – CEPA) as new because the EU’s agreement was not fully operational when it was undertaken. In fact, however, CEPA is modelled extremely closely on the EU-Japan agreement, with a few small differences. These include extensions on, e.g., digital trade, and one major loss – the inability of UK exporters to the EU to be able to count Japanese parts towards meeting the EU’s requirements for getting zero-tariff entry to the EU. Relative to having no agreement, the government estimated that CEPA would raise UK GDP by £1.5 billion (0.07% or £22 per head), but relative to what the UK would have had without Brexit the gains will be negligible or negative.  Parts (A) and (B) of the table below give the numbers in more detail, along with estimates from the same sources of the effects of these agreements on UK exports and imports with the partners. Of course, all modelling results are uncertain, but the ranges quoted reflect the different trade liberalisation scenarios assumed in the government’s analysis. Thus, for example, the UK-Australia deal would raise UK exports by 3.6% under a ‘substantial’ trade liberalisation and by 7.3% under an even more ambitious one. [One can also see that increases in imports are predicted to substantially exceed those in exports, but that is a story for another occasion.]  The changes in trade with the partners look impressive, but remember two key facts:  A trade agreement will divert some trade to, say, Australia from other partners, so total UK trade will increase by less, and  Australia and New Zealand are small trading partners, accounting for 1.7% and 0.2% of UK exports and 1.0% and 0.2% of UK imports respectively (in 2019).  But the small shares of overall UK trade are not enough to explain the modest impacts. Even the proposed UK-US trade agreement, shown in part (C) and a key aspiration of the Government, was estimated to increase UK GDP by only a modest 0.07%-0.16%. Bear in mind that the US is the UK’s largest single-country trading partner accounting for 20.5% and 17.9% of total exports and imports, respectively, in 2019.  The UK has also signed nearly 70 other agreements that are new to the UK, but which are designed as closely as possible ‘to reproduce the effects of trading agreements that previously applied’ when the UK was a member of the EU. They add nothing to UK trade, and, because they are not perfect replicas, actually harm it very slightly.  The issue is not that trade agreements are worth nothing, but that they barely scratch the surface of the UK’s challenge to make up the GDP lost by leaving the EU, which the Office for Budget Responsibility puts at 4%.  Thus, one might ask ‘if the effects are so small, why bother?’ Among the possible answers are that:  a) while each agreement is small, cumulatively they could sum to a significant amount,  b) the current agreements could be stepping stones to bigger, regional agreements, such as the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership,  c) there are other impacts beyond GDP and trade, such as on longer-run innovation, investment and productivity impacts, which the assessments are not good at capturing,  d) there may be specific sectoral access issues;  e) there may be additional non-trade objectives related to climate and the environment, for example.  None of these is convincing economically. On (a) and (b), non-EU partners account for about half of UK total trade and so, to counteract the OBR’s 4% loss from Brexit, would require agreements with each and every one of them to induce trade changes that create a 4% increment to UK GDP. That is nowhere in sight in the numbers in the table.  Answer (c) is conceivably true but there has been no such evidence and one would have to explain why agreements with non-EU countries would have this effect while a deeper agreement with the EU would not. Similarly, on (d), there certainly are disproportionate gainers from these agreements, but what are they and why do we preference them? On (e), again it is conceivably true, but the dilution of the climate clauses with Australia suggests the opposite.  The sad answer is that  f) the government is happy to accept, on our behalf, the economic losses from Brexit in return for political benefits (sovereignty), and trade agreements with other countries are merely making the best of a bad job from an economic perspective.

512,274092767212104833303891828559465658225,"Australia’s hopes of a locally developed COVID-19 vaccine have been dashed with news today the University of Queensland/CSL vaccine would not proceed to further clinical trials.  Unlike news about the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID vaccine earlier this week, there were no safety concerns with the UQ/CSL vaccine.  According to a statement to the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) earlier today, CSL said participants in the phase 1 trial received “false positive” results to HIV tests. They were not infected with HIV, nor did the vaccine contain the entire HIV virus.  Rather, the vaccine’s signature “molecular clamp” technology was formulated with parts of an HIV protein. When injected, these prompted the production of antibodies that were picked up in a range of HIV tests. In other words, if the vaccine had been widely rolled out, this could lead many people to think they had HIV when they didn’t.  The news prompted the federal government to announce it had cancelled its agreement to supply the UQ/CSL vaccine, which was always contingent on successfully completing clinical trials.  Instead, the government will supply more doses of other vaccines, including 20 million extra doses of the University of Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, to be made by CSL.  The Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID vaccine is the first with published peer-reviewed results from phase 3 clinical trials, a significant milestone.  Read more: The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is the first to publish peer-reviewed efficacy results. Here's what they tell us — and what they don't  As well as the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, existing arrangements are in place to supply Australians with the Pfizer/BioNTech and Novavax vaccines, should they prove safe and effective. That’s as well as vaccines available under the World Health Organisation-backed COVAX agreement.  Read more: Australia's just signed up for a shot at 9 COVID-19 vaccines. Here's what to expect  How could a COVID vaccine lead to a positive HIV test?  The UQ/CSL vaccine uses “molecular clamp” technology to stop the coronavirus spike protein from “wobbling about”. This more stable presentation is more likely to lead to a protective immune response.  The molecular clamp in UQ’s vaccine contains part of an HIV protein, a string of 80 amino acids. By itself, this is harmless and cannot cause an HIV infection or AIDS.  But there was always a theoretical possibility that once injected as part of the vaccine formulation, people’s immune systems would recognise it as “foreign” and raise antibodies against it. Until now, the research team thought the chance of that happening was low. And in its ASX statement CSL said people in the 216-person trial were fully informed of this possibility.  However, from what we’ve heard today, it’s clear that people’s immune systems did recognise the HIV protein fragment in the molecular clamp.  Had we rolled out this vaccine on a wider scale, we would have seen many more “false positive” HIV tests. This would have meant unnecessary anxiety while people sought further clarification about their HIV status.  It would also have undermined the public’s confidence in the COVID vaccination program. You have to have the public on board. So by acting early to clearly communicate concerns, the researchers have acted appropriately. And this should reinforce the public’s confidence in Australia’s COVID vaccination program, due to start from March 2021.  Read more: What will Australia's COVID vaccination program look like? 4 key questions answered  Is this the end of UQ’s ‘molecular clamp’ technology?  This particular molecular clamp is unique to UQ. So while this particular type will not be used for future vaccines, it’s likely the researchers will investigate and modify it to reduce the chance of any further HIV cross-reactivity.  I certainly don’t think it’s the end of this technology.  Read more: From adenoviruses to RNA: the pros and cons of different COVID vaccine technologies  So where does this leave us?  We’ve known all along that not all COVID-19 vaccines in early clinical trials would be successful. Safety issues or a lack of protection will halt some. But in this case, we had something different — a complication that would lead people to believe they had HIV when they didn’t, undermining people’s confidence in the COVID vaccine program.  That’s why it’s still important to pursue a broad portfolio of vaccine approaches and technologies. We don’t want to put all our eggs in one basket.  It’s also important to remember that even though the UQ/CSL vaccine will not proceed to late-stage clinical trials, phase 1 trials will continue, with results submitted for peer review in due course. That means researchers can analyse the results in more detail.",How did the University of Queensland/CSL vaccine fail due to ‘false positive’ HIV tests? A vaccine expert explains,true

To go back to the children’s page, please click here.  This isn’t an easy piece to write, for reasons that will shortly become clear, but I know it’s time to explain myself on an issue surrounded by toxicity. I write this without any desire to add to that toxicity.  For people who don’t know: last December I tweeted my support for Maya Forstater, a tax specialist who’d lost her job for what were deemed ‘transphobic’ tweets. She took her case to an employment tribunal, asking the judge to rule on whether a philosophical belief that sex is determined by biology is protected in law. Judge Tayler ruled that it wasn’t.  My interest in trans issues pre-dated Maya’s case by almost two years, during which I followed the debate around the concept of gender identity closely. I’ve met trans people, and read sundry books, blogs and articles by trans people, gender specialists, intersex people, psychologists, safeguarding experts, social workers and doctors, and followed the discourse online and in traditional media. On one level, my interest in this issue has been professional, because I’m writing a crime series, set in the present day, and my fictional female detective is of an age to be interested in, and affected by, these issues herself, but on another, it’s intensely personal, as I’m about to explain.  All the time I’ve been researching and learning, accusations and threats from trans activists have been bubbling in my Twitter timeline. This was initially triggered by a ‘like’. When I started taking an interest in gender identity and transgender matters, I began screenshotting comments that interested me, as a way of reminding myself what I might want to research later. On one occasion, I absent-mindedly ‘liked’ instead of screenshotting. That single ‘like’ was deemed evidence of wrongthink, and a persistent low level of harassment began.  Months later, I compounded my accidental ‘like’ crime by following Magdalen Berns on Twitter. Magdalen was an immensely brave young feminist and lesbian who was dying of an aggressive brain tumour. I followed her because I wanted to contact her directly, which I succeeded in doing. However, as Magdalen was a great believer in the importance of biological sex, and didn’t believe lesbians should be called bigots for not dating trans women with penises, dots were joined in the heads of twitter trans activists, and the level of social media abuse increased.  I mention all this only to explain that I knew perfectly well what was going to happen when I supported Maya. I must have been on my fourth or fifth cancellation by then. I expected the threats of violence, to be told I was literally killing trans people with my hate, to be called cunt and bitch and, of course, for my books to be burned, although one particularly abusive man told me he’d composted them.  What I didn’t expect in the aftermath of my cancellation was the avalanche of emails and letters that came showering down upon me, the overwhelming majority of which were positive, grateful and supportive. They came from a cross-section of kind, empathetic and intelligent people, some of them working in fields dealing with gender dysphoria and trans people, who’re all deeply concerned about the way a socio-political concept is influencing politics, medical practice and safeguarding. They’re worried about the dangers to young people, gay people and about the erosion of women’s and girl’s rights. Above all, they’re worried about a climate of fear that serves nobody – least of all trans youth – well.  I’d stepped back from Twitter for many months both before and after tweeting support for Maya, because I knew it was doing nothing good for my mental health. I only returned because I wanted to share a free children’s book during the pandemic. Immediately, activists who clearly believe themselves to be good, kind and progressive people swarmed back into my timeline, assuming a right to police my speech, accuse me of hatred, call me misogynistic slurs and, above all – as every woman involved in this debate will know – TERF.  If you didn’t already know – and why should you? – ‘TERF’ is an acronym coined by trans activists, which stands for Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminist. In practice, a huge and diverse cross-section of women are currently being called TERFs and the vast majority have never been radical feminists. Examples of so-called TERFs range from the mother of a gay child who was afraid their child wanted to transition to escape homophobic bullying, to a hitherto totally unfeminist older lady who’s vowed never to visit Marks & Spencer again because they’re allowing any man who says they identify as a woman into the women’s changing rooms. Ironically, radical feminists aren’t even trans-exclusionary – they include trans men in their feminism, because they were born women.  But accusations of TERFery have been sufficient to intimidate many people, institutions and organisations I once admired, who’re cowering before the tactics of the playground. ‘They’ll call us transphobic!’ ‘They’ll say I hate trans people!’ What next, they’ll say you’ve got fleas? Speaking as a biological woman, a lot of people in positions of power really need to grow a pair (which is doubtless literally possible, according to the kind of people who argue that clownfish prove humans aren’t a dimorphic species).  So why am I doing this? Why speak up? Why not quietly do my research and keep my head down?  Well, I’ve got five reasons for being worried about the new trans activism, and deciding I need to speak up.  Firstly, I have a charitable trust that focuses on alleviating social deprivation in Scotland, with a particular emphasis on women and children. Among other things, my trust supports projects for female prisoners and for survivors of domestic and sexual abuse. I also fund medical research into MS, a disease that behaves very differently in men and women. It’s been clear to me for a while that the new trans activism is having (or is likely to have, if all its demands are met) a significant impact on many of the causes I support, because it’s pushing to erode the legal definition of sex and replace it with gender.  The second reason is that I’m an ex-teacher and the founder of a children’s charity, which gives me an interest in both education and safeguarding. Like many others, I have deep concerns about the effect the trans rights movement is having on both.  The third is that, as a much-banned author, I’m interested in freedom of speech and have publicly defended it, even unto Donald Trump.  The fourth is where things start to get truly personal. I’m concerned about the huge explosion in young women wishing to transition and also about the increasing numbers who seem to be detransitioning (returning to their original sex), because they regret taking steps that have, in some cases, altered their bodies irrevocably, and taken away their fertility. Some say they decided to transition after realising they were same-sex attracted, and that transitioning was partly driven by homophobia, either in society or in their families.  Most people probably aren’t aware – I certainly wasn’t, until I started researching this issue properly – that ten years ago, the majority of people wanting to transition to the opposite sex were male. That ratio has now reversed. The UK has experienced a 4400% increase in girls being referred for transitioning treatment. Autistic girls are hugely overrepresented in their numbers.  The same phenomenon has been seen in the US. In 2018, American physician and researcher Lisa Littman set out to explore it. In an interview, she said:  ‘Parents online were describing a very unusual pattern of transgender-identification where multiple friends and even entire friend groups became transgender-identified at the same time. I would have been remiss had I not considered social contagion and peer influences as potential factors.’  Littman mentioned Tumblr, Reddit, Instagram and YouTube as contributing factors to Rapid Onset Gender Dysphoria, where she believes that in the realm of transgender identification ‘youth have created particularly insular echo chambers.’  Her paper caused a furore. She was accused of bias and of spreading misinformation about transgender people, subjected to a tsunami of abuse and a concerted campaign to discredit both her and her work. The journal took the paper offline and re-reviewed it before republishing it. However, her career took a similar hit to that suffered by Maya Forstater. Lisa Littman had dared challenge one of the central tenets of trans activism, which is that a person’s gender identity is innate, like sexual orientation. Nobody, the activists insisted, could ever be persuaded into being trans.  The argument of many current trans activists is that if you don’t let a gender dysphoric teenager transition, they will kill themselves. In an article explaining why he resigned from the Tavistock (an NHS gender clinic in England) psychiatrist Marcus Evans stated that claims that children will kill themselves if not permitted to transition do not ‘align substantially with any robust data or studies in this area. Nor do they align with the cases I have encountered over decades as a psychotherapist.’  The writings of young trans men reveal a group of notably sensitive and clever people. The more of their accounts of gender dysphoria I’ve read, with their insightful descriptions of anxiety, dissociation, eating disorders, self-harm and self-hatred, the more I’ve wondered whether, if I’d been born 30 years later, I too might have tried to transition. The allure of escaping womanhood would have been huge. I struggled with severe OCD as a teenager. If I’d found community and sympathy online that I couldn’t find in my immediate environment, I believe I could have been persuaded to turn myself into the son my father had openly said he’d have preferred.  When I read about the theory of gender identity, I remember how mentally sexless I felt in youth. I remember Colette’s description of herself as a ‘mental hermaphrodite’ and Simone de Beauvoir’s words: ‘It is perfectly natural for the future woman to feel indignant at the limitations posed upon her by her sex. The real question is not why she should reject them: the problem is rather to understand why she accepts them.’  As I didn’t have a realistic possibility of becoming a man back in the 1980s, it had to be books and music that got me through both my mental health issues and the sexualised scrutiny and judgement that sets so many girls to war against their bodies in their teens. Fortunately for me, I found my own sense of otherness, and my ambivalence about being a woman, reflected in the work of female writers and musicians who reassured me that, in spite of everything a sexist world tries to throw at the female-bodied, it’s fine not to feel pink, frilly and compliant inside your own head; it’s OK to feel confused, dark, both sexual and non-sexual, unsure of what or who you are.  I want to be very clear here: I know transition will be a solution for some gender dysphoric people, although I’m also aware through extensive research that studies have consistently shown that between 60-90% of gender dysphoric teens will grow out of their dysphoria. Again and again I’ve been told to ‘just meet some trans people.’ I have: in addition to a few younger people, who were all adorable, I happen to know a self-described transsexual woman who’s older than I am and wonderful. Although she’s open about her past as a gay man, I’ve always found it hard to think of her as anything other than a woman, and I believe (and certainly hope) she’s completely happy to have transitioned. Being older, though, she went through a long and rigorous process of evaluation, psychotherapy and staged transformation. The current explosion of trans activism is urging a removal of almost all the robust systems through which candidates for sex reassignment were once required to pass. A man who intends to have no surgery and take no hormones may now secure himself a Gender Recognition Certificate and be a woman in the sight of the law. Many people aren’t aware of this.  We’re living through the most misogynistic period I’ve experienced. Back in the 80s, I imagined that my future daughters, should I have any, would have it far better than I ever did, but between the backlash against feminism and a porn-saturated online culture, I believe things have got significantly worse for girls. Never have I seen women denigrated and dehumanised to the extent they are now. From the leader of the free world’s long history of sexual assault accusations and his proud boast of ‘grabbing them by the pussy’, to the incel (‘involuntarily celibate’) movement that rages against women who won’t give them sex, to the trans activists who declare that TERFs need punching and re-educating, men across the political spectrum seem to agree: women are asking for trouble. Everywhere, women are being told to shut up and sit down, or else.  I’ve read all the arguments about femaleness not residing in the sexed body, and the assertions that biological women don’t have common experiences, and I find them, too, deeply misogynistic and regressive. It’s also clear that one of the objectives of denying the importance of sex is to erode what some seem to see as the cruelly segregationist idea of women having their own biological realities or – just as threatening – unifying realities that make them a cohesive political class. The hundreds of emails I’ve received in the last few days prove this erosion concerns many others just as much. It isn’t enough for women to be trans allies. Women must accept and admit that there is no material difference between trans women and themselves.  But, as many women have said before me, ‘woman’ is not a costume. ‘Woman’ is not an idea in a man’s head. ‘Woman’ is not a pink brain, a liking for Jimmy Choos or any of the other sexist ideas now somehow touted as progressive. Moreover, the ‘inclusive’ language that calls female people ‘menstruators’ and ‘people with vulvas’ strikes many women as dehumanising and demeaning. I understand why trans activists consider this language to be appropriate and kind, but for those of us who’ve had degrading slurs spat at us by violent men, it’s not neutral, it’s hostile and alienating.  Which brings me to the fifth reason I’m deeply concerned about the consequences of the current trans activism.  I’ve been in the public eye now for over twenty years and have never talked publicly about being a domestic abuse and sexual assault survivor. This isn’t because I’m ashamed those things happened to me, but because they’re traumatic to revisit and remember. I also feel protective of my daughter from my first marriage. I didn’t want to claim sole ownership of a story that belongs to her, too. However, a short while ago, I asked her how she’d feel if I were publicly honest about that part of my life, and she encouraged me to go ahead.  I’m mentioning these things now not in an attempt to garner sympathy, but out of solidarity with the huge numbers of women who have histories like mine, who’ve been slurred as bigots for having concerns around single-sex spaces.  I managed to escape my first violent marriage with some difficulty, but I’m now married to a truly good and principled man, safe and secure in ways I never in a million years expected to be. However, the scars left by violence and sexual assault don’t disappear, no matter how loved you are, and no matter how much money you’ve made. My perennial jumpiness is a family joke – and even I know it’s funny – but I pray my daughters never have the same reasons I do for hating sudden loud noises, or finding people behind me when I haven’t heard them approaching.  If you could come inside my head and understand what I feel when I read about a trans woman dying at the hands of a violent man, you’d find solidarity and kinship. I have a visceral sense of the terror in which those trans women will have spent their last seconds on earth, because I too have known moments of blind fear when I realised that the only thing keeping me alive was the shaky self-restraint of my attacker.  I believe the majority of trans-identified people not only pose zero threat to others, but are vulnerable for all the reasons I’ve outlined. Trans people need and deserve protection. Like women, they’re most likely to be killed by sexual partners. Trans women who work in the sex industry, particularly trans women of colour, are at particular risk. Like every other domestic abuse and sexual assault survivor I know, I feel nothing but empathy and solidarity with trans women who’ve been abused by men.  So I want trans women to be safe. At the same time, I do not want to make natal girls and women less safe. When you throw open the doors of bathrooms and changing rooms to any man who believes or feels he’s a woman – and, as I’ve said, gender confirmation certificates may now be granted without any need for surgery or hormones – then you open the door to any and all men who wish to come inside. That is the simple truth.  On Saturday morning, I read that the Scottish government is proceeding with its controversial gender recognition plans, which will in effect mean that all a man needs to ‘become a woman’ is to say he’s one. To use a very contemporary word, I was ‘triggered’. Ground down by the relentless attacks from trans activists on social media, when I was only there to give children feedback about pictures they’d drawn for my book under lockdown, I spent much of Saturday in a very dark place inside my head, as memories of a serious sexual assault I suffered in my twenties recurred on a loop. That assault happened at a time and in a space where I was vulnerable, and a man capitalised on an opportunity. I couldn’t shut out those memories and I was finding it hard to contain my anger and disappointment about the way I believe my government is playing fast and loose with womens and girls’ safety.  Late on Saturday evening, scrolling through children’s pictures before I went to bed, I forgot the first rule of Twitter – never, ever expect a nuanced conversation – and reacted to what I felt was degrading language about women. I spoke up about the importance of sex and have been paying the price ever since. I was transphobic, I was a cunt, a bitch, a TERF, I deserved cancelling, punching and death. You are Voldemort said one person, clearly feeling this was the only language I’d understand.  It would be so much easier to tweet the approved hashtags – because of course trans rights are human rights and of course trans lives matter – scoop up the woke cookies and bask in a virtue-signalling afterglow. There’s joy, relief and safety in conformity. As Simone de Beauvoir also wrote, “… without a doubt it is more comfortable to endure blind bondage than to work for one’s liberation; the dead, too, are better suited to the earth than the living.”  Huge numbers of women are justifiably terrified by the trans activists; I know this because so many have got in touch with me to tell their stories. They’re afraid of doxxing, of losing their jobs or their livelihoods, and of violence.  But endlessly unpleasant as its constant targeting of me has been, I refuse to bow down to a movement that I believe is doing demonstrable harm in seeking to erode ‘woman’ as a political and biological class and offering cover to predators like few before it. I stand alongside the brave women and men, gay, straight and trans, who’re standing up for freedom of speech and thought, and for the rights and safety of some of the most vulnerable in our society: young gay kids, fragile teenagers, and women who’re reliant on and wish to retain their single sex spaces. Polls show those women are in the vast majority, and exclude only those privileged or lucky enough never to have come up against male violence or sexual assault, and who’ve never troubled to educate themselves on how prevalent it is.  The one thing that gives me hope is that the women who can protest and organise, are doing so, and they have some truly decent men and trans people alongside them. Political parties seeking to appease the loudest voices in this debate are ignoring women’s concerns at their peril. In the UK, women are reaching out to each other across party lines, concerned about the erosion of their hard-won rights and widespread intimidation. None of the gender critical women I’ve talked to hates trans people; on the contrary. Many of them became interested in this issue in the first place out of concern for trans youth, and they’re hugely sympathetic towards trans adults who simply want to live their lives, but who’re facing a backlash for a brand of activism they don’t endorse. The supreme irony is that the attempt to silence women with the word ‘TERF’ may have pushed more young women towards radical feminism than the movement’s seen in decades.  The last thing I want to say is this. I haven’t written this essay in the hope that anybody will get out a violin for me, not even a teeny-weeny one. I’m extraordinarily fortunate; I’m a survivor, certainly not a victim. I’ve only mentioned my past because, like every other human being on this planet, I have a complex backstory, which shapes my fears, my interests and my opinions. I never forget that inner complexity when I’m creating a fictional character and I certainly never forget it when it comes to trans people.  All I’m asking – all I want – is for similar empathy, similar understanding, to be extended to the many millions of women whose sole crime is wanting their concerns to be heard without receiving threats and abuse.",J.K.

514,193515974468817230404670915936134013917,"Share this article Whatsapp  Facebook  Twitter  Linkedin Almer Mikhail (The Jakarta Post) Bandung ● Mon, July 12, 2021 08:36 272 6f088072615a978e43b39d144e693ca1 1 Health Covid,COVID-19,COVID-19-medical-supplies,Ivermectin,hoax Free  Amid the ongoing “second wave” of COVID-19, some people have started taking it upon themselves to fend off the ever-looming threat of the coronavirus with unproven do-it-yourself (DIY) remedies and self-medication tips spreading rampantly on social media platforms, such as WhatsApp and Facebook.  As with most things in this age of information, the origins of these methods are largely untraceable. Worse still, the majority of these methods are not based in science. Just how potentially dangerous could these unproven methods be?  Muhamad Rachman Fadhilah, a 26-year-old medical intern, said that the medical community was fully aware of and concerned about these DIY anti-coronavirus methods. One strange tip he recalled was one that advised wearing masks inside out, which claimed that the inner layer could filter air better. Some of the more dangerous ones he recalled included suggestions to drink cajuput oil and to take certain antibiotics or antivirals.  These unfounded “tips”, no matter how well meaning, could potentially cause physical harm. Cajuput oil, which is generally applied to the skin, can cause respiratory problems when inhaled, according to WebMD. Meanwhile, consuming antibiotics and antivirals without a prescription from a licensed doctor could lead to improper dosing, side effects, contraindications with any current medication and other improper uses that could harm a person’s health.  Oddly enough, these unproven methods from unknown sources had even made their way to his extended family’s WhatsApp group, heedless of Rachman’s medical training.  Sudden rise of ivermectin  One of the currently sought-after medications is ivermectin, a medicine that treats parasitic infections like roundworm and scabies, but which is now being touted as effective in preventing and treating COVID-19.  While research is ongoing on the antiparastic as a potential treatment for COVID-19, the World Health Organization has recommended its use only in clinical trials.  Read also: Prices jump for unproven COVID-19 drug Ivermectin  According to 27-year-old doctor Fauzan Trisuryoaji, who also volunteers at the Human Resources Development Agency (BPSDM), this claim is not backed by either scientific evidence or research. Fauzan added that the current promotion of ivermectin as COVID-19 therapy was similar to rumors circulating in the early stages of the pandemic that recommended chloroquine, a medicine for treating malaria, could be used to treat COVID-19.  A similar statement was expressed by the Food and Drug and Monitoring Agency (BPOM), which iterated that ivermectin still needed to undergo clinical testing to assess its efficacy in treating the coronavirus. It also advised against purchasing ivermectin without a medical prescription, including through online platforms.  What’s also dangerous is that these self-medication tips trending on social media prompt people to go buy certain drugs in large amounts, which create shortages for hospitals and medical professionals so they aren’t available for the patients who actually need them.  “There are hospitals that haven't received any supplies of antibiotics and antivirals for the past three days,” Fauzan said on July 1, 2021.  Many hospitals are also facing a shortage of oxygen.  Read also: ‘Like a war zone’: Doctors, hospitals plead for help amid COVID-19 upsurge  Another of Fauzan’s concerns is self-touted COVID-19 “medicines” from nonmedical professionals, such as a product that Muslim cleric Andi Hidayat is giving away for free for people who test positive for the virus. The problem is, he has not disclosed the drug’s composition.  Just rumor: A stock illustration shows the inner layer of a surgical mask, which has been falsely claimed to be more effective at filtering air. (JP/Almer Mikhail)  Popularity is also growing for alternative “treatments”, most of which are home remedies made from natural ingredients, such as coconut water, lemon juice, ginger water and garlic.  Nanda Satia Nugraha, a 28-year-old IT product analyst and musician, said these were the types of natural remedies often recommended on his extended family’s WhatsApp group, comprised mostly of older family members. Another forwarded message was about the importance of wudu, Islamic ablution, to cleanse one’s body of viruses and bacteria.  Nanda recognized that while these tips may have potential health benefits, what irked him was how they seemed to be held in higher regard than professional medical advice. Rachman and Fauzan also expressed the same concern, emphasizing that the belief in alternative methods as better than medical advice was often more dangerous than the methods themselves.  When his mother contracted COVID-19, freelancer Nada Ardhi Pradya, 29, recounted that his relatives often gave unsolicited nonmedical advice along with their well wishes. It turned out that several relatives who shared these “tips” didn’t even follow them, Nada said, including an aunt who shared the now well-known concoction of coconut water with lemon juice, salt and honey, which she hadn't even tried herself.  Misinformation epidemic  According to psychologist Mutia Aprilia Permata Kusumah, people tended to believe information that aligned with their personal beliefs and further, that people subconsciously sought information that reaffirmed their own beliefs.  Unfortunately, because of poor digital literacy, Indonesians often don’t verify the easily digestible information they find before consuming it. Paired with the tendency of Indonesians to share anything they think might be useful, this often leads to widespread misinformation.  That most unverified information is spread by older people, said Mutia, was due to the fact that they did not grow up in a digital world, so checking facts and sources when using the internet did not come naturally to them. They also generally trusted the people who provided the information, since most older users communicate primarily with close friends and relatives on digital platforms.

The state-owned pharmaceutical company started producing ivermectin to meet a sudden surge in demand for the drug, which is for treating parasitic infections, after its unproven efficacy as a COVID-19 treatment started trending on social media. (SOEs Ministry/Dhika Permana)  This far-reaching trend in self-medication tips could also be attributed to a general sense of panic and desperation among the public during this seemingly unending pandemic, Fauzan said.  Psychologist Mutia said that since older people were more at risk of getting and developing severe COVID-19, they were more eager to spread any new tidbits they felt might help fend off or treat the disease. Added to the fact that COVID-19 tests and treatments were not cheap, alternative methods could be seen as a viable solution for those who did not have the luxury of working from home.  ‘Pandemic denial’  While working in the COVID-19 emergency and isolation wards at Cikalong Wetan Regional General Hospital four months ago, Rachman noticed that many people still didn’t believe that the pandemic was real, even though it had been going on for more than a year. Fauzan also noticed that people were growing more dismissive of the health protocols, going so far as to say that public compliance was much lower today than it was at the start of the pandemic in March 2020.  Meanwhile, Rachman and Fauzan had both observed people who resisted testing and treatment, even to the point they swore furiously at the health workers who were trying to help them.  Nanda believed that a deeply ingrained distrust of health services contributed to the widespread popularity of self-medication and home remedies across the archipelago. Lack of trust in the government and the inconsistency of government policies also played a part in pushing people toward conspiracy theories. Left with no one to trust, he said, some people were opting for information that came from alternative, non-authoritative sources.  Other factors that may have contributed to the situation, Nanda said, included feelings of unfairness, marginalization and discrimination, feeling more knowledgeable than others and just plain denial.  Practical health measures  The best way to prevent the spread of COVID-19 remained the same, Rachman said: “If there is no urgent need, it’s better to stay at home and avoid large crowds. If you really must go outside, wear your mask properly and don’t forget to wash your hands.”  To support the body’s immune system, Rachman recommended eating nutritious and balanced meals, exercise regularly, get enough rest and take vitamins and supplements if necessary. Maintaining vigilance was also crucial, as people who had recovered from COVID-19 could get it again.  Separately, Fauzan stressed the importance of getting vaccinated. As a medical professional making daily rounds, he had experienced firsthand how being vaccinated had helped boost his immunity against the disease.  As for the rampant spread of unverified information and unproven methods, Rachman said collective effort was needed in meticulously checking information before consuming or forwarding it.  “The key is to be more responsible in what you share on the internet. If you share health-related information, you should have a credible source to back it up. It can’t be based on hearsay,” he stressed.",Don't DIY: 'Alternative remedies' pose new dangers in COVID-19 infodemic,true
515,110822399338211793293151321772553974668,"A common reason cited for not getting vaccinated against COVID-19—especially among the young and healthy—is ""I trust my immune system"" or some variation of that line. The same goes for those who have already had the virus and assume they've developed some natural immunity.  Though the human immune system is indeed an extraordinary mechanism, it's not worth gambling with a disease as unpredictable and serious as COVID-19, says infectious disease expert Anna Durbin, a professor of international health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.  ""It's Russian roulette,"" she says. ""Young people tend to think they're invincible. But it just takes that one slip and your entire life could change.""  With the delta variant, we're seeing many more young people on ventilators in hospitals and dying, Durbin says. And declining the vaccine is more than just a personal decision: An infected person can easily transmit the virus to others, including immunocompromised people at higher risk for grave illness and children under 12 who can't yet access the vaccines.  During a conversation with the Hub, Durbin, a faculty member at the Center for Immunization Research, talked about some of the popular misconceptions surrounding natural immunity and the purpose of vaccines.  What would you say to someone who wants to put their faith in their own immune system with COVID-19?  It's not a good idea. Yes, natural infection does provide some immunity, so the next time you get that disease, you won't get as sick. But here's the problem: Your first encounter with that disease could go very wrong. With COVID-19, you could end up very ill, you could end up in the hospital, or you could die. We're seeing huge rates of hospitalizations and deaths, and you don't want to risk becoming one of those statistics. And there are other potential complications: You could lose your sense of taste and smell for months, you could develop long-haul COVID-19. It's an unpredictable disease, and we don't know how it's going to hit different people.  That's where the vaccines come in. Vaccines provide protection without any of the morbidities you can get with a natural COVID-19 protection. We don't have vaccines for things like the common cold because most people don't get very sick from that, so it's not worth the effort to make different vaccines for every different cold virus. But when we see viruses or other bacteria that can cause severe illness, like COVID-19, we need the protection of a vaccine to prevent the hospitalizations and deaths. Vaccines are the reason we no longer see so many other diseases that people suffered from in the past: smallpox, measles, polio, even chicken pox.  For those who have already had COVID-19 in the past, why would a vaccine still be necessary?  The vaccines still lower your risks. We have evidence showing that if you've been naturally infected with COVID-19 and you aren't vaccinated, your risk of getting reinfected with symptomatic disease is about 2.5–fold higher. When you introduce the vaccine to someone who's already had COVID-19, the body says, ""Hey, I remember that, I'm going to stimulate the immune response so you're protected."" You're pumping up your antibodies to higher levels so they can stop the virus before it enters your system.  Anna Durbin Professor, Bloomberg School of Public Health and Johns Hopkins School of Medicine ""We're seeing some breakthrough infections among vaccinated people and will continue to, but that's expected and doesn't mean the vaccines are failing.""  So would someone who's had both COVID-19 and the vaccine have the most protection possible?  There's no doubt that natural infection confers immunity, and we're seeing some evidence—not surprising—that a previous COVID-19 infection plus vaccination provides more durable protection than simply vaccines alone. But that doesn't mean that vaccinated people should go out there and try to get infected. That risk just isn't worth taking as people, even young healthy people, can get very, very sick. We want to simply stop infections from happening, full-stop, to get this virus under control and prevent it from mutating further.  What if the response to that is ""vaccinated people can transmit the virus, too,"" a fact now confirmed?  They can, but we have evidence showing that vaccinated people are less likely to both get infected and to transmit the virus, and may spread the virus for a shorter time.  Are antibody tests a reliable way for someone to assess their immunity to COVID-19?  There are a couple things that are flawed about that. First, antibody levels wane over time; that happens naturally. Second, these tests don't capture the full picture. Antibodies are just one part of the equation. They're not primarily responsible for preventing severe disease once you're infected—that's the job of your memory immune response, which remembers the pathogen it saw before and gears up to control infection. Then there's the whole other arm of your immune system called T-cells, whose job is to recognize the virus in your body, identify cells infected with the virus, and destroy those cells.  The antibody tests are designed to diagnose whether you've had the infection recently. They're not designed to tell you how your immune system is going to respond to COVID-19, or how well your vaccines are going to work.  What other misconceptions about immunity do you want to clear up?  I want people to understand that vaccination-induced immunity, like natural immunity, doesn't necessarily protect you from getting infected with COVID-19. The purpose of vaccinations is to prevent severe illness and death. So, yes, we're seeing some breakthrough infections among vaccinated people and will continue to, but that's expected and doesn't mean the vaccines are failing. Even with the delta variant, this is a success story because we're seeing vaccines for the most part do what they need to do.  Also, this topic of booster shots I think is a bit of a distraction right now. There's this idea out there that your immunity suddenly falls off a cliff at six or eight months. That's not what's happening. You still have that memory immune response, and that's why we're still seeing effectiveness against the delta variant.  The other thing I need to stress is that booster shots aren't going to stop delta. The only way we can do that is to have unvaccinated people get their initial vaccinations. That's the only way we're going to control not only delta but the emergence of other variants that could prolong or worsen this pandemic.",Vaccines beat natural immunity in fight against COVID-19,true
516,210898543724742870029444243349551213353,"Babies whose caretakers are masked will miss some of these visual cues, and it’s possible, Dr. Lewkowicz said, that young children may have some trouble sorting out who goes with which voice.  “Masks are not a great thing for communication in young kids,” Dr. Lewkowicz said. On the other hand, he said, the time children spend at home with people who are not masked will give them a chance to practice picking up the visual cues. And there is opportunity to be creative, and to help children take full advantage of the information that they do get. He suggested that parents and teachers could “encourage their kids to communicate more through gestures,” and even make a game of helping children to find ways of communicating with their hands and bodies.  Eva Chen, a developmental psychologist who is an associate professor at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, focuses her research on children’s cognitive development with respect to social groups. “We should give more credit to our own children,” she said, “that being covered for a few hours every day isn’t going to make them less able to recognize social expressions.” Voices, gestures and overall body language are all important for children, she said. While children typically pay attention to people’s mouths while they are talking, “it’s by far not the only cue children have to communicate and to learn,” she said, and referenced a 2012 study showing that children were able to read facial emotions just as well when a mask was added.  In fact, all of the scientists I talked to who have studied the complex ways that children process and use the information hidden by masks also believe that children will find ways to communicate, and that parents and teachers can help them. Several of them also pointed out that children with neurodevelopmental issues such as autism will need special help and special consideration — but also that some of the techniques that parents and teachers already use to help these children learn to interpret social cues may be helpful for everyone when masks are in use.  Sarah Gaither, an assistant professor of psychology and neuroscience at Duke University, said in an email, “With mask wearing now being required in most school settings, children and adults should start practicing being more explicitly verbal by stating their emotions out loud.” Children will get better at reading people’s eyes, she suggested, and at understanding emotional content from tone of voice.  But in addition, she wrote, “parents and teachers may also want to ask children more often what they are feeling as well.”  Parents can focus on the time they have at home — unmasked — with their children, and emphasize face-to-face activities and interactions. “I am a huge believer in the importance of plasticity” — or adaptability — “in early development,” Dr. Lewkowicz said. “Despite the short-term deprivation, because of plasticity, there’s lots of ways to compensate.”",Do Masks Impede Children’s Development?,true
517,14390754013805147743717920169510618345,"To a world that has become weary, yet accustomed to playing defense against SARS-CoV-2, evolution of the Delta variant is both unwelcome and unsurprising. Delta, or B.1.617.2, was first identified in India in Dec. 2020. Within a matter of months, this particular variant spread to over 98 countries around the world, becoming the dominant variant in more than a dozen of those countries, including India, the U.K., Israel and the United States. Delta is now responsible for more than 83% of COVID-19 cases being reported in the U.S. and, with only 48% of the total U.S. population fully vaccinated, conditions are ripe for continued evolution and spread of SARS-CoV-2. Three foundational questions continue to drive research with each new variant that’s identified.  1. How Contagious Is the Delta Variant?  Scientifically accurate atomic model of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Source: Alexey Solodovnikov (Idea, Producer, CG, Editor)  Data indicate that Delta is 40-60% more transmissible than Alpha and almost twice as transmissible as the original Wuhan strain of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, significantly more viral particles have been found in the airways of patients infected with the Delta variant. A Chinese study reported that viral loads in Delta infections were ~1,000 times higher than those in infections caused by other variants. In response to this information, the World Health Organization (WHO) regards Delta as “the fastest and fittest” variant so far.  2. Is the Delta Variant More Dangerous than Other Variants of Concern?  According to surveys conducted in the U.K., where Delta accounts for ~90% of current COVID-19 cases, symptoms of Delta tend to be a little different than other strains, but that does not necessarily mean the associated symptoms are more severe. Fever, headache, sore throat and runny nose are common, while cough and loss of smell are not. Other reports link Delta to more serious symptoms, including hearing impairment, severe gastrointestinal issues and blood clots leading to tissue death and gangrene. Research is ongoing to determine if Delta infection is associated with increased hospitalization and death. One early study assessing the risk of hospital admission in Scotland reported that hospitalization is twice as likely in unvaccinated individuals with Delta than in unvaccinated individuals with Alpha.  Case numbers and hospitalizations are once again on the rise in the U.S., especially in states where vaccination percentages are low and the Delta variant is surging. On July 16, 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported a 7-day average increase in new COVID-19 cases of 69.3% and a 35% increase in hospitalizations. Still, it is difficult to determine whether Delta is actually making people sicker than previous forms of the virus or if it is simply circulating amongst more vulnerable populations where case numbers are high, vaccination rates are low and increased stress on hospital systems is impacting patient care and disease outcomes.  What is clear is that the majority of hospitalizations and COVID-19-associated deaths in the U.S. are occurring in unvaccinated people, leading to a chilling warning from CDC director Dr. Rochelle Walensky that “this is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated.”  3. Will Vaccines Remain Protective against the Delta Variant?  Studies show that 2 doses of vaccines are effective at preventing hospitalization and death, but neutralization levels of vaccinated sera are lower against the Delta variant compared to the original strain. A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine tested neutralization activity of sera from individuals who had recovered from natural SARS-CoV-2 infection and sera from individuals who had been fully vaccinated with Moderna or Pfizer vaccines against infectious B.1.617.2 virus. Data from the study indicated that, on average, the Delta variant was 2.9 times less susceptible to neutralization than the Wuhan strain, but most convalescent serum samples and all vaccination serum samples showed detectable neutralization activity. As a result, researchers concluded that immunity conferred by mRNA vaccines is likely to be retained against the Delta variant.  These results were supported by research, published in Nature, that evaluated the sensitivity of infectious Delta virus against monoclonal antibodies, convalescent sera and sera developed after vaccination. The study found that some antibodies targeting the N-terminal domain and receptor binding domain of the spike protein (S protein) showed impaired binding and neutralization of the Delta variant. Additionally, convalescent sera, collected up to 12 months post-symptoms from individuals who had recovered from natural SAR-CoV-2 infection, were 4-fold less effective at neutralizing Delta than Alpha. Sera from individuals who were partially vaccinated (had received 1 dose of Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccine) showed little to no neutralizing activity against Delta. Sera from 95% of those who received 2 doses of either vaccine generated a neutralizing response that was 3-5-fold less potent against Delta than Alpha.  Another study published in the New England Journal of Medicine used a test-negative, case-control design to estimate vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease caused by the Delta variant, compared to Alpha. The study, which was conducted in the U.K., reported an 88% efficacy against Delta after 2 doses of mRNA vaccine, but only 30.7% efficacy after 1 dose, which is below the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)’s 50% efficacy threshold for COVID-19 vaccines.  Initial reports indicated that the J&J vaccine was also effective against Delta, however a new study, not yet peer-reviewed, indicated that sera from a significant fraction of J&J vaccinated individuals showed a 5-7 fold decrease in neutralizing titers, which, according to the study’s mathematical modeling, could result in decreased protection from infection.  Taken together, these data support the importance of full dose vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, but reports of reduced vaccine efficacy against Delta warrant further investigation into breakthrough infections and the possibility of vaccine booster shots. Genomic analysis of isolates from 63 vaccine breakthrough infections in India (not yet peer-reviewed) revealed that B.1.617.2 was the predominant lineage in groups who were partially and fully vaccinated with either AstraZeneca or Covaxin (an inactivated virus-based vaccine developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research).  In late July, 2021, the CDC published a report evaluating outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 that were associated with large public gatherings in Barnstable County, Massachusetts. Out of the 469 identified cases of COVID-19, 346 or 74% of them were breakthrough infections that occurred in people who were fully vaccinated with 2 doses of Pfizer or Moderna, or 1 dose of the J&J vaccine. Genomic analysis revealed that Delta was responsible for 90% of the 133 sequenced breakthrough infections. This information prompted the CDC to recommend the use of masks in indoor public spaces, regardless of vaccination status, in areas where COVID-19 transmission is high. Further research into breakthrough infections that occur after COVID-19 vaccination is needed.  Meanwhile, companies are already developing booster doses to improve efficacy against circulating variants. Pfizer plans to seek FDA authorization for its booster dose, which is expected to elicit stronger neutralization against the Delta variant. However, antibodies alone do not give the whole picture of immune protection. How other vaccine-elicited immune components, such as T cells and B cells, respond when challenged by the Delta variant is still relatively unclear, and conversation about whether booster doses are needed yet are ongoing.

Culpable Mutations of the Delta Variant  Amino acid changes to the spike (S) protein in SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs). (Click to expand image.) Source: American Society for Microbiology    Without a doubt, increased transmissibility, coupled with potential increases in disease severity and immune escape, makes Delta especially dangerous. The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is the main target of COVID-19 vaccines, and most serum neutralizing antibody responses elicited during natural SARS-CoV-2 infection are directed at the receptor binding domain (RBD) of S protein. Therefore, if a mutation (or combination of mutations) causes changes to the S protein that are not recognized by first wave antibodies, immunity developed against the reference strain may be ineffective against the new variant. The SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant possesses a combination of S gene mutations that make it particularly worrisome to scientists, including multiple mutations in the receptor binding domain (RBD), a mutation located near the furin cleavage site and a number of mutations in a vulnerable region of the N-terminal domain known as an “antigenic supersite.”  Receptor Binding Domain  The receptor binding domain is the portion of the spike protein that binds directly to human ACE2 receptors. Delta has 3 RBD mutations. The first, a lysine to asparagine substitution at position 417, is present in some, but not all sequences of B.1.617.2. It is also common to the Beta variant and has been associated with conformational changes to S protein, which may aid in immune escape. The second mutation, a leucine to arginine substitution at position 452, is common to the former variant of interest Epsilon, and is known to increase affinity for ACE2 receptors found on the surface of a variety of human cells, including the lungs. And the third, a threonine to lysine substitution at position 478, is common to the B.1.1.519 lineage, and has been predicted to increase electrostatic potential and steric hindrance, which may further increase RBD/ACE2 binding affinity and enable immune escape.  Furin Cleavage Site  The spike protein consists of a receptor-binding subunit (S1) and a fusion subunit (S2), which must be cleaved from each other to mediate membrane fusion and cause infection. The furin cleavage site is the junction where that cleavage takes place, and Delta contains a proline to arginine substitution (also common to Alpha) near this cleavage site at position 681 that makes the sequence less acidic and causes furin to recognize and cut more effectively. As a result, more spike proteins are primed to enter human cells. Research indicates that less than 10% of spike proteins are primed in the original strain, 50% are primed in Alpha and greater than 75% are primed in Delta. The mutation likely increases viral infectivity and transmissibility; however, it must occur on the background of additional spike protein mutations in order to be consequential.  NTD-Antigenic Supersite  Scientists have identified regions in the N-terminal domain of S protein that are especially vulnerable to antibody recognition and attack, called NTD-antigenic supersites. Delta contains a number of mutations that fall within an antigenic supersite, including a threonine to arginine substitution at position 19, a glycine to aspartate substitution at position 142, deletions at positions 156 and 157 and an arginine to glycine substitution at position 158. Accumulated mutations in antigenic supersites are thought to enhance the virus’s ability to avoid immune detection.  Amino acid changes to the spike (S) protein in the Delta variant.

Source: American Society for Microbiology  Stopping Transmission Is Key to Controlling Variants  Humanity has its hands full as the virus continues to mutate and evolve potential mechanisms to escape the immune defenses its hosts have worked so hard and sacrificed so much to develop. In addition to the variants of concern currently being monitored, researchers are keeping an eye on a number of variants of interest, including Lambda. When specific mutations (like K417N/T) become fixed in different virus lineages, it is evidence that natural selection may be occurring. According to Dr. Vaughn Cooper, ASM’s Council on Microbial Sciences-elected Board Director and evolutionary biologist, stopping the virus is key. “The more infections, the more chance that mutations will occur and thus the more likely selection will enrich the best mutations to improve the virus,” he explained. Vaccination is the best weapon in the fight to curb transmission.",How Dangerous Is the Delta Variant (B.1.617.2)?,true
518,223963932067244870889550963132099585318,"In the search for treatments for COVID-19, many researchers are focusing their attention on a specific protein that allows the virus to infect human cells. Called the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, or ACE2 “receptor,” the protein provides the entry point for the coronavirus to hook into and infect a wide range of human cells. Might this be central in how to treat this disease?  We are scientists with expertise in pharmacology, molecular biology and biochemistry, with a strong commitment to applying these skills to the discovery of novel therapies for human disease. In particular, all three authors have experience studying angiotensin signaling in various disease settings, a biochemical pathway that appears to be central in COVID-19. Here are some of the key issues to understand about why there’s so much focus on this protein.  What is the ACE2 receptor?  ACE2 is a protein on the surface of many cell types. It is an enzyme that generates small proteins – by cutting up the larger protein angiotensinogen – that then go on to regulate functions in the cell.  Using the spike-like protein on its surface, the SARS-CoV-2 virus binds to ACE2 – like a key being inserted into a lock – prior to entry and infection of cells. Hence, ACE2 acts as a cellular doorway – a receptor – for the virus that causes COVID-19.  Where in the body is it found?  ACE2 is present in many cell types and tissues including the lungs, heart, blood vessels, kidneys, liver and gastrointestinal tract. It is present in epithelial cells, which line certain tissues and create protective barriers.  The exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the lungs and blood vessels occurs across this epithelial lining in the lung. ACE2 is present in epithelium in the nose, mouth and lungs. In the lungs, ACE2 is highly abundant on type 2 pneumocytes, an important cell type present in chambers within the lung called alveoli, where oxygen is absorbed and waste carbon dioxide is released.  What is the normal role ACE2 plays in the body?  ACE2 is a vital element in a biochemical pathway that is critical to regulating processes such as blood pressure, wound healing and inflammation, called the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) pathway.  ACE2 helps modulate the many activities of a protein called angiotensin II (ANG II) that increases blood pressure and inflammation, increasing damage to blood vessel linings and various types of tissue injury. ACE2 converts ANG II to other molecules that counteract the effects of ANG II.  Of greatest relevance to COVID-19, ANG II can increase inflammation and the death of cells in the alveoli which are critical for bringing oxygen into the body; these harmful effects of ANG II are reduced by ACE2.  When the SARS-CoV-2 virus binds to ACE2, it prevents ACE2 from performing its normal function to regulate ANG II signaling. Thus, ACE2 action is “inhibited,” removing the brakes from ANG II signaling and making more ANG II available to injure tissues. This “decreased braking” likely contributes to injury, especially to the lungs and heart, in COVID-19 patients.  Does everyone have the same number of ACE2 on their cells?  No. ACE2 is present in all people but the quantity can vary among individuals and in different tissues and cells. Some evidence suggests that ACE2 may be higher in patients with hypertension, diabetes and coronary heart disease. Studies have found that a lack of ACE2 (in mice) is associated with severe tissue injury in the heart, lungs and other tissue types.  Does the quantity of receptors determine whether someone gets more or less sick?  This is unclear. The SARS-CoV-2 virus requires ACE2 to infect cells but the precise relationship between ACE2 levels, viral infectivity and severity of infection are not well understood.  Even so, aside from its ability to bind the SARS-CoV-2 virus, ACE2 has protective effects against tissue injury, by mitigating the pathological effects of ANG II.  When the amount of ACE2 is reduced because the virus is occupying the receptor, individuals may be more susceptible to severe illness from COVID-19. That is because enough ACE2 is available to facilitate viral entry but the decrease in available ACE2 contributes to more ANG II-mediated injury. In particular, reducing ACE2 will increase susceptibility to inflammation, cell death and organ failure, especially in the heart and the lung.  Which organs are most severely damaged by SARS-CoV-2?  The lungs are the primary site of injury by SARS-CoV-2 infection, which causes COVID-19. The virus reaches the lungs after entry in the nose or mouth.  ANG II drives lung injury. If there is a decrease in ACE2 activity (because the virus is binding to it), then ACE2 can’t break down the ANG II protein, which means there is more of it to cause inflammation and damage in the body.  The virus also impacts other tissues that express ACE2, including the heart, where damage and inflammation (myocarditis) can occur. The kidneys, liver and digestive tract can also be injured. Blood vessels may also be a site for damage.  In a recent research paper, we argued that a key factor that determines severity of damage in patients with COVID-19 is abnormally high ANG II activity.  What are ACE inhibitors? Are they a possible treatment or prophylactic for SARS-CoV-2?  Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE, aka ACE1) is another protein, also found in tissues such as the lung and heart, where ACE2 is present. Drugs that inhibit the actions of ACE1 are called ACE inhibitors. Examples of these drugs are ramipril, lisinopril, and enalapril. These drugs block the actions of ACE1 but not ACE2. ACE1 drives the production of ANG II. In effect, ACE1 and ACE2 have a “yin-yang” relationship; ACE1 increases the amount of ANG II, whereas ACE2 reduces ANG II.  By inhibiting ACE1, ACE inhibitors reduce the levels of ANG II and its ability to increase blood pressure and tissue injury. ACE inhibitors are commonly prescribed for patients with hypertension, heart failure and kidney disease.  Another commonly prescribed class of drugs, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs, e.g., losartan, valsartan, etc.) have similar effects to ACE inhibitors and may also be useful in treating COVID-19.  Evidence for a protective effect of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers in patients with COVID-19 was shown in recent work co-authored by one of us - Dr. Loomba.  No evidence exists to suggest prophylactic use of these drugs; we do not advise readers to take these drugs in the hopes that they will prevent COVID-19. We wish to emphasize that patients should only take these drugs as instructed by their health care provider.  New clinical trial tests ACE inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2  In collaboration with a multidisciplinary group of investigators, Dr. Loomba has initiated a multicenter (randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled) clinical trial to examine the efficacy of ramipril - an ACE inhibitor - compared to a placebo in reducing mortality, ICU admission or need for mechanical ventilation in patients with COVID-19.

The authorization was based on the FDA’s thorough and transparent evaluation of the data that included input from independent advisory committee experts who overwhelmingly voted in favor of making the vaccine available to children in this age group.  Key points for parents and caregivers:  Effectiveness: Immune responses of children 5 through 11 years of age were comparable to those of individuals 16 through 25 years of age. In addition, the vaccine was found to be 90.7% effective in preventing COVID-19 in children 5 through 11.  Safety: The vaccine’s safety was studied in approximately 3,100 children age 5 through 11 who received the vaccine and no serious side effects have been detected in the ongoing study.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices will meet next week to discuss further clinical recommendations.  “As a mother and a physician, I know that parents, caregivers, school staff, and children have been waiting for today’s authorization. Vaccinating younger children against COVID-19 will bring us closer to returning to a sense of normalcy,” said Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock, M.D. “Our comprehensive and rigorous evaluation of the data pertaining to the vaccine’s safety and effectiveness should help assure parents and guardians that this vaccine meets our high standards.”  The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine for children 5 through 11 years of age is administered as a two-dose primary series, 3 weeks apart, but is a lower dose (10 micrograms) than that used for individuals 12 years of age and older (30 micrograms).  In the U.S., COVID-19 cases in children 5 through 11 years of age make up 39% of cases in individuals younger than 18 years of age. According to the CDC, approximately 8,300 COVID-19 cases in children 5 through 11 years of age resulted in hospitalization. As of Oct. 17, 691 deaths from COVID-19 have been reported in the U.S. in individuals less than 18 years of age, with 146 deaths in the 5 through 11 years age group.  “The FDA is committed to making decisions that are guided by science that the public and healthcare community can trust. We are confident in the safety, effectiveness and manufacturing data behind this authorization. As part of our commitment to transparency around our decision-making, which included our public advisory committee meeting earlier this week, we have posted documents today supporting our decision and additional information detailing our evaluation of the data will be posted soon. We hope this information helps build confidence of parents who are deciding whether to have their children vaccinated,” said Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.  The FDA has determined this Pfizer vaccine has met the criteria for emergency use authorization. Based on the totality of scientific evidence available, the known and potential benefits of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in individuals down to 5 years of age outweigh the known and potential risks.  FDA Evaluation of Available Effectiveness Data  The effectiveness data to support the EUA in children down to 5 years of age is based on an ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled study that has enrolled approximately 4,700 children 5 through 11 years of age. The study is being conducted in the U.S., Finland, Poland and Spain. Children in the vaccine group received two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine containing 10 micrograms of messenger RNA per dose. The FDA analyzed data that compared the immune response of 264 participants from this study to 253 participants 16 through 25 years of age who had two higher doses of the vaccine in a previous study which determined the vaccine to be effective in preventing COVID-19. The immune responses of the younger age participants were comparable to the older participants.  The FDA also conducted a preliminary analysis of cases of COVID-19 occurring seven days after the second dose. In this analysis, among participants without evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2, 3 cases of COVID-19 occurred among 1,305 vaccine recipients and 16 cases of COVID-19 occurred among 663 placebo recipients; the vaccine was 90.7% effective in preventing COVID-19.  FDA Evaluation of Available Safety Data  The available safety data to support the EUA include more than 4,600 participants (3,100 vaccine, 1,538 placebo) ages 5 through 11 years enrolled in the ongoing study. In this trial, a total of 1,444 vaccine recipients were followed for safety for at least 2 months after the second dose.  Commonly reported side effects in the clinical trial included injection site pain (sore arm), redness and swelling, fatigue, headache, muscle and/or joint pain, chills, fever, swollen lymph nodes, nausea and decreased appetite. More children reported side effects after the second dose than after the first dose. Side effects were generally mild to moderate in severity and occurred within two days after vaccination, and most went away within one to two days.  The FDA and CDC safety surveillance systems have previously identified increased risks of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of tissue surrounding the heart) following vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, particularly following the second dose, and with the observed risk highest in males 12 through 17 years of age. Therefore, the FDA conducted its own benefit-risk assessment using modelling to predict how many symptomatic COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and deaths from COVID-19 the vaccine in children 5 through 11 years of age would prevent versus the number of potential myocarditis cases, hospitalizations, ICU admissions and deaths that the vaccine might cause. The FDA’s model predicts that overall, the benefits of the vaccine would outweigh its risks in children 5 through 11 years of age.  Ongoing Safety Monitoring  Pfizer Inc. has updated its safety monitoring plan to include evaluation of myocarditis, pericarditis and other events of interest in children 5 through 11 years of age. In addition, the FDA and the CDC have several systems in place to continually monitor COVID-19 vaccine safety and allow for the rapid detection and investigation of potential safety problems.  It is mandatory for Pfizer Inc. and vaccination providers to report to any serious adverse events, cases of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome and cases of COVID-19 that result in hospitalization or death in vaccinated individuals. It is also mandatory for vaccination providers to report all vaccine administration errors to VAERS for which they become aware and for Pfizer Inc. to include a summary and analysis of all identified vaccine administration errors in monthly safety reports to the FDA.  Data Supports New Vaccine Formulation to Improve Stability and Storage Conditions  The FDA today also authorized a manufacturing change for the vaccine to include a formulation that uses a different buffer; buffers help maintain a vaccine’s pH (a measure of how acidic or alkaline a solution is) and stability. This new formulation is more stable at refrigerated temperatures for longer periods of time, permitting greater flexibility for vaccination providers.  The new formulation of the vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc. contains Tris buffer, a commonly used buffer in a variety of other FDA-approved vaccines and other biologics, including products for use in children. The FDA evaluated manufacturing data to support the use of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine containing Tris buffer and concluded it does not present safety or effectiveness concerns.

Getting a booster is safe, easy, free, and you don’t even have to stick to your original vaccine. This is your chance to continue to keep yourself and your community healthy.”  The Governor was joined today by California Health and Human Services Secretary Dr. Mark Ghaly and community and local leaders who have supported vaccine equity efforts in the region. To date, Asian Health Services (AHS) has administered nearly 30,000 COVID-19 vaccination doses and 56,000 COVID tests. On October 25, AHS initiated their first public booster dose clinic at a park in Oakland’s Little Saigon area.  Last week, the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) approved an Emergency Use Authorization for the Johnson & Johnson and Moderna booster doses, followed by recommendations from both the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and the Western States Scientific Review Workgroup that included “mix and match,” the ability to receive a booster different from a person’s original vaccine series. The Pfizer-BioNTech booster was approved in September and has since been available for eligible populations seeking to strengthen their immunities to COVID-19 and its variants.  Governor Newsom receives COVID booster in Oakland.  Already, nearly two million Californians have received their booster dose, representing 14.3 percent of the nationwide total recipients as reported by the CDC. The state’s Vaccinate ALL 58 campaign will continue to focus on driving vaccine efforts in lower-income and non-English speaking communities with cultural competency and in-language services. Its community based organization network, in partnership with philanthropy, is now standing at over 700 organizations and will support outreach and appointment assistance efforts.  California has one of the highest vaccination rates in the country and the highest of the large states, with nearly 87 percent of the 12-and-over population having received at least one dose. Over the past few weeks, between 45 and 55 percent of all COVID-19 vaccine doses have been administered as boosters.  Boosters are recommended for all Johnson & Johnson vaccine recipients who are 18-years and older and who were vaccinated two or more months ago. The CDC and Western States Scientific Safety Review Workgroup have declared the following groups of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna recipients eligible for a booster dose six months or more after their initial series:  65 years and older  Age 18+ who live in long-term care settings  Age 18+ who have underlying medical conditions  Age 18+ who work or live in high-risk settings  Age 18+ who are at increased risk due to social inequity  Booster doses are not required for one to be considered fully vaccinated, but are encouraged for those that are eligible to ensure significant protection from COVID-19 and its variants, especially as we enter the winter months. Booster doses went through the same thorough scientific review process as the initial vaccine series and have been proven safe.  Asian Health Services was established in 1974 in Oakland’s Chinatown, and has since expanded to a 12-site community health center serving over 28,000 patients in Oakland and its surrounding communities in English and 14 different Asian languages.  “We’re encouraging all eligible community members to come and get their booster shot,” said Mychi Nguyen, M.D., Chief Medical Officer, Asian Health Services. “This is the best way to continue to protect yourself against COVID.”  For more information on how to receive a booster in your area and other COVID-19 vaccine information, visit www.myturn.ca.gov.  ###","At Oakland Health Clinic, Governor Newsom Receives Moderna Booster, Encourages Eligible Californians to Get their COVID Booster to Keep Immunity Strong",true

On Tuesday, April 13, Texas’ power grid again faced failure as extended maintenance work and unseasonable weather patterns brought typical supply levels lower. ERCOT called for power conservation, and averted crisis by the evening, rescinding the request.  By Wednesday, April 14, Texas was again at risk for blackouts due to power supply issues. ERCOT declared it would be “capacity insufficient” from 1-8 p.m CDT. This means ERCOT does not have enough reserves and will ask people in Texas to conserve power again.  This is being caused by a weather pattern that is unusually warm for this time of year in South Texas. The results: strong demand and on-peak wind generation that is 6.5 gigawatts, compared with average April wind generation of 11 gigawatts. Solar generation was also lower. It hit only 38% during peak load on April 14, while the average is 72%.  The weather isn’t totally to blame for the power supply issues, of course. The large number of units that are offline for maintenance following the winter storm is also driving this shortage. The reported telemetered outages on April 14 is 21.1 gigawatts, where normally ERCOT would be measuring around 14.5 gigawatts of outages in ERCOT for the third week of April.

Hamstrung by pandemic fatigue, economic constraints and political discord, public health officials have struggled to control the surging pandemic. But now, a rush of interim analyses from pharmaceutical companies Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech have spurred optimism that a novel type of vaccine made from messenger RNA, known as mRNA, can offer high levels of protection by preventing COVID-19 among people who are vaccinated.  Although unpublished, these preliminary reports have exceeded the expectations of many vaccine experts, including mine. Until early this year, I worked on developing vaccine candidates against Zika and dengue. Now I am coordinating an international effort to collect reports on adult patients with current or previous cancers who have also been diagnosed with COVID-19.  Promising preliminary results  Moderna reported that during the phase 3 study of its vaccine candidate mRNA-1273, which enrolled 30,000 adult U.S. participants, just five of the 95 COVID-19 cases occurred among the vaccinated, while 90 infections were identified in the placebo group. This corresponds to an efficacy of 94.5%. None of the infected patients who received the vaccine developed severe COVID-19, while 11 (12%) of those who received the placebo did.  Similarly, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine candidate, BNT162b2, was 90% effective in preventing infection during the phase 3 clinical trial, which enrolled 43,538 participants, with 30% in U.S. and 42% abroad  How does mRNA vaccine work?  Vaccines train the immune system to recognize the disease-causing part of a virus. Vaccines traditionally contain either weakened viruses or purified signature proteins of the virus.  But an mRNA vaccine is different, because rather than having the viral protein injected, a person receives genetic material – mRNA – that encodes the viral protein. When these genetic instructions are injected into the upper arm, the muscle cells translate them to make the viral protein directly in the body.  This approach mimics what the SARS-CoV-2 does in nature – but the vaccine mRNA codes only for the critical fragment of the viral protein. This gives the immune system a preview of what the real virus looks like without causing disease. This preview gives the immune system time to design powerful antibodies that can neutralize the real virus if the individual is ever infected.  While this synthetic mRNA is genetic material, it cannot be transmitted to the next generation. After an mRNA injection, this molecule guides the protein production inside the muscle cells, which reaches peak levels for 24 to 48 hours and can last for a few more days.  Why is making an mRNA vaccine so fast?  Traditional vaccine development, although well studied, is very time-consuming and cannot respond instantaneously against novel pandemics such as COVID-19.  For example, for seasonal flu, it takes roughly six months from identification of the circulating influenza virus strain to produce a vaccine. The candidate flu vaccine virus is grown for about three weeks to produce a hybrid virus, which is less dangerous and better able to grow in hens’ eggs. The hybrid virus is then injected into a lot of fertilized eggs and incubated for several days to make more copies. Then the fluid containing virus is harvested from eggs, the vaccine viruses are killed, and the viral proteins are purified over several days.  The mRNA vaccines can leapfrog the hurdles of developing traditional vaccines such as producing noninfectious viruses, or producing viral proteins at medically demanding levels of purity.  MRNA vaccines eliminate much of the manufacturing process because rather than having viral proteins injected, the human body uses the instructions to manufacture viral proteins itself.  Also, mRNA molecules are far simpler than proteins. For vaccines, mRNA is manufactured by chemical rather than biological synthesis, so it is much quicker than conventional vaccines to be redesigned, scaled up and mass-produced.  In fact, within days of the genetic code of the SARS-CoV-2 virus becoming available, the mRNA code for a candidate vaccine testing was ready. What’s most attractive is that once the mRNA vaccine tools become viable, mRNA can be quickly tailored for other future pandemics.  What are problems with mRNA?  MRNA technology isn’t new. It was shown a while back that when synthetic mRNA is injected into an animal, the cells can produce a desired protein. But the progress remained slow. That’s because mRNA is not only notoriously unstable and easy to degrade into smaller components, it is also easily destroyed by the human body’s immune defenses, which make delivering it to the target very inefficient.  But beginning in 2005, researchers figured out how to stabilize mRNA and package it into small particles to deliver it as a vaccine. The mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are expected to be the first using this technology to be approved by the FDA.  After a decade of work, the mRNA vaccines are now ready for evaluation. Physicians will be watching for unintended immune reactions, which can be both helpful and detrimental.  Why keep mRNA supercold?  The most important challenge for development of a mRNA vaccine remains its inherent instability, because it is more likely to break apart above freezing temperatures.  Modification of the mRNA building blocks and development of the particles that can cocoon it relatively safely have helped the mRNA vaccine candidates. But this new class of vaccine still requires unprecedented freezer conditions for distribution and administration.  What are the refrigeration requirements?  The Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine will need to be optimally stored at minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit and will degrade in around five days at normal refrigeration temperatures of slightly above freezing.  [Get facts about coronavirus and the latest research. Sign up for The Conversation’s newsletter.]  In contrast, Moderna claims its vaccine can be maintained at most home or medical freezer temperatures for up to six months for shipping and longer-term storage. Moderna also claims its vaccine can remain stable at standard refrigerated conditions, of 36 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit, for up to 30 days after thawing, within the six-month shelf life.  Not surprisingly, Pfizer is also developing shipping containers using dry ice to address shipping constraints.","How mRNA vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna work, why they’re a breakthrough and why they need to be kept so cold",true
525,325922615428627862090063184221793126708,"CBC News has obtained an unredacted copy of a lawsuit launched by an anti-vaccination advocacy group against the government response to the coronavirus crisis, the details of which can now be independently verified and publicly reported for the first time.  The lawsuit was filed July 6 in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in Toronto by Aylmer, Ont.-based Vaccine Choice Canada and seven individuals. The legal action is a challenge under Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms to the country's pandemic response measures, including compulsory face masks, the closure of businesses and the enforcement of physical distancing.  The plaintiffs are suing the governments of Canada and Ontario, the City of Toronto, senior politicians, a number of local Ontario health authorities, health officials and the CBC over their response to the pandemic.  The suit states that the closure of businesses to prevent the spread of the virus was ""extreme, unwarranted and unjustified,"" that self-isolation measures imposed on individuals were ""not scientific, nor medically based nor proven"" and that the mandatory wearing of face coverings in some public spaces imposes ""physical and psychological harm.""  The lawsuit alleges that the measures violate Sections 2 (right of association), 7 (life, liberty and security of the person), 8 (unlawful search and seizure), 9 (arbitrary detention of enforcement officers) and 15 (equality before and under the law) of the charter.  ""The measures ... are further not in accordance with the tenets of fundamental justice in their overbreadth, nor are they justified under S.1 of the charter in that they are demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society,"" the lawsuit states.  Vaccine Choice Canada describes itself as a watchdog organization whose mandate is ""to empower families to make educated, voluntary, and informed decisions about vaccination,"" but public health authorities have criticized the group for spreading false or misleading information about vaccines and immunization.  Names of plaintiffs redacted for fear of harassment  While copies of the 191-page statement of claim exist online, the names and stories of some of the individual plaintiffs have been redacted on the documents by the plaintiffs themselves. Social media posts from Rocco Galati, the lawyer representing the plaintiffs, said it was done out of precaution to protect the individuals from harassment.  Here is the statement of claim filed in Ontario Superior Court.<a href=""https://t.co/rULDUrXdQe"">https://t.co/rULDUrXdQe</a><br><br>Some of the plaintiffs' names have been redacted to protect them from harassment. —@roccogalatilaw  CBC News has agreed not to name the individuals, who range from a former professor to working parents, a chiropractor and people living with chronic illnesses or disabilities.  No date has been set for when the case will go to court, and it's unclear whether a judge will allow it to proceed.  The lawsuit is seeking $1 million in general damages and $10 million in punitive damages, plus legal costs.  No statements of defence have been filed in the case.  Legal scholar says lawsuit has claims worth examining  Among the personal stories contained in the statement of claim is that of a 23-year-old Hamilton man with autism who has the emotional capacity of a four-year-old. His guardian claims in the suit that the man doesn't have the capacity to understand pandemic health measures, which have ""totally mentally devastated"" him by depriving him of his routines and his social and emotional network.  Another account is of a Mississauga woman who says she can't wear a mask because it triggers a traumatic memory of having a mask forcibly held over her face during a sexual assault.  Protesters gather outside the Ontario Legislature in Toronto in May to demonstrate against government actions related to the coronavirus pandemic. (Chris Young/The Canadian Press)  The claim states the woman is often faced with a choice when she goes out in public without a mask: risk being embarrassed by disclosing her private history or be denied service at local businesses.  ""I don't think we need to violate people's privacy or have them disclose medical conditions, particularly in the context of a private business,"" said Jacob Shelley, an assistant professor of health law and ethics at Western University in London, Ont., who examined an unredacted copy of the lawsuit provided by CBC News.  ""We need to have a discussion about what does it mean to mandate masks. What does it mean to have everyone wear masks when you're indoors and you can't socially distance, because I think there are going to be legitimate instances where people are going to be unable or unwilling to wear a mask for reasons that really are their own.  ""There's lucid, valid, potential issues that maybe are worth being adjudicated before the court.""  A sign encouraging physical distancing at Union Station in Toronto. The City of Toronto is one of the parties named in the suit. (Evan Mitsui/CBC)  Shelley said given the content of the lawsuit, a public debate over masks risks being overshadowed by other claims that aren't supported by science.  ""The 'pandemic' is false, and the measures phony, designed and implemented for improper and ulterior purposes, at the behest of the WHO, controlled and directed by billionaire, corporate oligarchs,"" the statement of claim says.  ""The plaintiffs state, and the fact is, that the evidence is that far many more people have died as a result of the 'pandemic' measures themselves than purportedly from the 'COVID-19 deaths,' even if one takes the deaths 'caused' by COVID as a given.""  A sign put up by Ottawa public health authorities specifying mask rules and who is exempt from them. The lawsuit alleges that measures such as mandatory mask-wearing are 'extreme, unwarranted and unjustified' and some may even impose 'physical and psychological harm.' (Kate Porter/CBC)  Other lawsuit claims  Other claims made in the lawsuit are unrelated to the coronavirus pandemic.  ""Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology report the development of a novel way to record a patient's vaccination history by using smartphone-readable nano crystals called 'quantum dots,' embedded in the skin using micro-needles. In short, a vaccine chip embedded in the body. This work and research are funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,"" the lawsuit said.  The statement of claim includes a timeline that begins in the year 2000 when Bill Gates steps down as the head of Microsoft to start the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. It also states Gates expects a ""'twenty-fold' return on his $10 billion vaccine investment within the next few decades.""  Included in the timeline are references to the Chinese military, 5G networks, international vaccine programs and the Rockefeller Foundation as relevant to the creation and spread of the coronavirus, but the lawsuit isn't clear on how.  Shelley said including such references in the statement of claim without providing supporting scientific evidence could ultimately be what gets the suit dismissed before it goes to trial under Ontario's rules of civil procedure.  Toronto lawyer Rocco Galati, who is representing plaintiffs in the suit, initially agreed to speak to CBC News but then did not respond to follow-up requests for comment. (Trevor Hagan/The Canadian Press)  CBC News reached out multiple times to Galati, who is listed as the spokesperson for the lawsuit in a press release issued by Vaccine Choice Canada.

527,278812246073014102879250602230382527428,"Barr’s comments came after The New York Times reported that in 2017 and 2018, the Justice Department secretly seized the records of at least 12 people connected to the House Intelligence Committee, including its current chair. Barr became attorney general in 2019.  The Justice Department’s internal watchdog announced Friday it would open a review of the records seizures, and Democratic leaders are standing up their own probes. According to the Times, the leak investigation swept up the metadata of the committee’s top Democrat, Rep. Adam Schiff of California, who has since become its chair, and Rep. Eric Swalwell of California, another prominent Trump critic who sits on the panel.  Barr said that while he was attorney general, he was “not aware of any congressman’s records being sought in a leak case.” He added that Trump never encouraged him to zero in on the Democratic lawmakers who reportedly became targets of the former president’s push to unmask leakers of classified information.  Trump “was not aware of who we were looking at in any of the cases,” Barr said. “I never discussed the leak cases with Trump. He didn’t really ask me any of the specifics.”  The Justice Department’s inspector general, Michael Horowitz, is launching a separate investigation. The department said on Friday that Horowitz’s review would center on “DOJ’s use of subpoenas and other legal authorities” to obtain records of lawmakers, journalists, and others associated with ongoing investigations into unauthorized leaks.  In a statement on Friday, Schiff applauded the Attorney General for requesting and Inspector General investigation into the matter but said it “will not obviate the need for other forms of oversight and accountability — including public oversight by Congress — and the department must cooperate in that effort as well.”  Democratic congressional leaders are already vowing to investigate the Trump Justice Department’s efforts to seize the communications records. And Barr’s comments are unlikely to quell their criticisms of his leadership at the department.  Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Judiciary Committee Chair Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) on Friday called for Barr and his predecessor as attorney general, former Sen. Jeff Sessions, to appear before the Judiciary panel to answer questions about the secret efforts to subpoena Democrats’ communications metadata. The revelations about the Trump-era leak hunt have raised fresh questions about the former president’s use of his executive powers to monitor members of Congress who were investigating him.  “This appalling politicization of the Department of Justice by Donald Trump and his sycophants must be investigated immediately by both the DOJ Inspector General and Congress,” Schumer and Durbin, the top two Democrats in the upper chamber, said in a joint statement, adding that the Judiciary Committee “will vigorously investigate this abuse of power.”  While Democrats control the panel, a subpoena would require the support of at least one GOP member because the committee is evenly split between Democrats and Republicans. Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the committee’s top Republican, indicated on Friday that he opposes a congressional probe.  “Investigations into members of Congress and staff are nothing new, especially for classified leaks,” Grassley said in a statement. “The Justice Department has specific procedures for such sensitive investigations, and the inspector general is already working to determine if they were followed.”  Barr said he installed Osmar Benvenuto in DOJ’s National Security Division in February 2020 to try to revive the leak investigations after Craig Carpenito, the U.S. attorney for New Jersey, recommended him to Barr as “a very experienced prosecutor [who] could quickly sort out which of any of these cases merited further investigative steps and what could be done to bring them to resolution.”  “I was getting criticized by Cabinet members and members of the Intelligence Community about the department not having done anything on these leak cases, so I wanted to make sure they were being pursued,” Barr said.  When the subpoenas reportedly went out, Rod Rosenstein was the deputy attorney general. John Demers became the head of DOJ’s National Security Division, which handles leak probes, in February of 2018. Rosenstein has since left the department for private practice; Demers is still heading the National Security Division.  Mary McCord, a career attorney, headed the National Security Division before Demers’ Senate confirmation.  “All I can say is that any investigation involving an elected official would be considered a sensitive matter that would need high-level approval at the department,” she told POLITICO when reached for comment.  Both Schiff and Swalwell have been among Trump’s most vocal critics, and the former president frequently went after them on Twitter. Trump’s Justice Department sought communications records for Intelligence panel staffers and family members, including a minor, according to the Times.  Trump himself tweeted repeatedly that he believed Schiff was breaking the law by leaking classified material. The president’s missives would have presented major challenges for any prosecutor trying to bring charges against the lawmakers.  “Congressman Adam Schiff, who spent two years knowingly and unlawfully lying and leaking, should be forced to resign from Congress!” he tweeted on March 28, 2019. Twitter has since removed Trump’s account, and his tweets are archived separately.  But an unlikely pro-Trump ally came to House Democrats’ defense on Friday, as Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) — himself facing scrutiny from federal prosecutors in a sex trafficking probe — responded that “DOJ has a very nasty tendency to target its critics, Republican and Democrat.”  “The Schiff story reminded me of the DOJ’s threats to use criminal process against House staff exposing their misdeeds,” Gaetz said in a statement. “I stand against all of it, no matter how much I personally dislike Schiff.”",Barr distances himself from Trump-era subpoenas of Democratic lawmakers,true
528,311989506752018109144968150823849310910,"Advertisement  President Joe Biden flew to northern Delaware Friday night and departed Sunday night. The weekend visit included a round of golf and the confirmation of his grandson.  The president, wearing a cap from the Beau Biden Foundation, hit the links at the Wilmington Country Club on Saturday. The foundation, formed in honor of the president’s late son and former Delware Attorney General, focuses on childrens issues.  Advertisement  Golf partners were Ron Olivere and Steve Ricchett. Olivere is the father of Beau Biden’s widow Hallie.  Biden is a member of the club located near his home in the Greenville area.  Pool reporters shouted out questions to Biden about the refugee situation.  It was the president’s first golf outing since taking office in January. In the past, Biden was known as one of the better golfers on the Washington, D.C. political scene.  On Sunday, Joe and Jill Biden attended the confirmation of his grandson Hunter Biden II at St. Joseph on the Brandywine II and visited a residence in Greenville.  The Cape Gazette reported Saturday that the First Lady had been staying at the family’s second home near Rehoboth Beach after undergoing a medical procedure that went well. It did not appear that the president had traveled to Rehoboth.  Ocean City, MD business owners have been concerned about being able to tow banner advertisng due to possible flight bans over beach areas should the Bidens stay at the residence during the summer.  The Cape Gazette earlier reported that a landing pad is available for the president at a nearby state park’s parking lot.  Joe Biden has been criticized for frequent weekend trips from the White House to Delaware from some motorists who get caught up in the delays, those who believe he should not travel during the pandemic, or some who see such travel as too costly.  The sentiments surface on Facebook pages of news sites and also include supporters chiming in. Biden supporters point to the frequent trips of his predecessor Donald Trump to his golf resort on the Florida coast as well as golfing in Washington, D.C. area and at his New Jersey country club.  Perhaps out of concern about traffic tie-ups that have been featured in the News Journal, Biden departed to Washington, D.C. Sunday night, arriving at the White House at around 9:30 p.m. via Marine One. He departed the White House early Friday night, arriving at New Castle Airport, with a small motorcade taking him to his residence.  The Delaware route to and from his home was recently in the news when the Coast Guard asked for a security designation for the Christina River. A crossing over the river is on the motorcade route.  The visits do have a modest economic impact on Wilmington, thanks to a small press corps that travels with the president. The visits continue to raise the profile of Wilmington as reporters use the city as a backdrop.  Recently the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised that travel is a low-risk activity for vaccinated Americans. In Delaware about 40 percent of the state’s population has received at least one shot.  The president’s Friday schedule included an in-person visit from the Prime Minister of Japan who asked Pfizer for more vaccine.","Biden travels to Delaware for weekend visit that includes round of golf, grandson's confirmation",true

The report, called Deported to Danger: United States deportation policies expose Salvadorans to death and abuse, also found that nearly 11,000 people were registered as missing during the decade. “The United States has to have known this was happening because the cases were publicly reported and more importantly because Salvadorans make it clear in asylum applications that this is their reality,” Elizabeth Kennedy, co-author of the report said in a statement. “But this reality is ignored or not believed by U.S. authorities.” Editor’s Note: This cheat has been updated after incorrectly stating that the majority of migrants and asylum seekers from El Salvador who were deported by the United States have been killed, raped or tortured.",138 Migrants Sent Back to El Salvador by the U.S. Were Killed,false
530,293230144468390790613323794352701054980,"Since the advent of the automobile, manufacturers have designed different engines to limit the environmental impact posed by the millions of pounds of carbon emissions cars generate annually. Among these are ethanol, natural gas, electricity, and even propane. But perhaps the least-known of these is the car that was said to run on water. And that may be because its inventor, Stanley Meyer, was murdered shortly after he patented his breakthrough. Stan Meyer’s Car With a Water-Powered Engine Meyer’s invention promised a revolution in the automotive industry. It worked through an electric water fuel cell, which divided any kind of water — including salt water — into its fundamental elements of hydrogen and oxygen, by utilizing a process far simpler than the electrolysis method. Despite skepticism about the legitimacy of a car that runs on water, Meyer was able to patent his invention under Section 101 of the Subject Matter Eligibility Index, meaning he proved to a patent review board that his invention worked reliably. Meyer’s water-powered engine was the result of 20 years of research and dedication, and he claimed it was capable of converting tap water into enough hydrogen fuel to drive his car from one end of the country to the other. His invention was mind-boggling and promised a future of non-polluting vehicles that could be refueled with a garden hose. Video Player is loading.XThis is a modal window.

According to statistics, “Cars release approximately 333 million tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere annually, which is 20 percent of the world’s total.” Of course, these condemning statistics could be eradicated if automobiles were run on alternative fuels, which begs the question, why aren’t they? Who wouldn’t love this idea? Well, for starters, it’s the petroleum industry. Meyer and other alternative transportation inventors were up against copious amounts of money from Big Oil. Exxon, the world’s largest publicly traded oil and gas company, reported earnings in 2018 of $76.61 billion. And this is but one of many oil corporations that not only wield tremendous political and economic power, but also the power to influence public opinion. And according to critics, they’re willing and able to quell inventions that threaten to reduce or eliminate the use of fossil fuels. The oil industry always puts up a big fight. They not only profit tremendously by warfare (tanks and planes do not run without fuel), but they have also been instrumental in instigating wars to feed the world’s most destructive addiction. Those who profit from selling oil and gas have built their fortunes upon it — and their incomes and futures would be in jeopardy should an alternative, sustainable fuel be introduced to replace their deleterious products. To protect all that they have built in terms of perennial profits, international clout, and influence on major world economies, Big Oil continues to be the strongest political force to overturn policies in an effort to combat environmental incentives for alternative energy and transportation, and to destroy or marginalize all opposing innovation in these areas. Stanley Meyer’s Mysterious Death On March 21, 1998, Meyer was having lunch at a Cracker Barrel with his brother and two potential Belgian investors. The four clinked their glasses to toast their commitment to uplifting the world, but after taking a sip of his cranberry juice, Meyer clutched his throat, sprang to his feet, and ran outside. Rushing after him, his brother Stephen found him down on his knees, vomiting violently. He quickly muttered his last words, “They poisoned me.” Meyer’s death was investigated for three months, though it was eventually written on the coroner’s report that he died of a cerebral aneurysm. Stephen Meyer insists his brother was murdered. After all, Meyer’s invention posed an incalculable threat to billions of oil industry dollars and untold fortunes, and he’d successfully resisted succumbing to numerous buyout offers. Additionally, the inventor had warded off pressure from numerous overseas visitors and weathered persistent government spying operations. And, perhaps not so strangely, those investors who dined with the Meyer brothers on that fateful day declined to offer so much as a condolence following Meyer’s demise. Stan Meyer Water Powered Car Inventor Stanley Meyer’s Legacy Lives On While conspiracies shroud Meyer’s invention and death — some say it is impossible for his water fuel cell to do what it claimed to — one thing is clear: without an alternative fuel source of some sort, the earth’s climate crisis will only continue to deepen. Many environmentalists, engineers, and activists are pouring their time into finding sustainable solutions, but until the average consumer takes an active interest, progress will be slow. Alternative energy proponents are hopeful that the demand for sustainability could potentially lead vehicle manufacturers to become independent of fossil fuels, but very few of even the most optimistic environmentalists can conceive of Big Oil releasing its grip despite the damage it continues to cause. The old adage ‘all is fair in love and war,’ seems obvious to those who have seen alternative fuel and transportation inventions come and go, as war is certain to come to those who threaten an industry that has dug its heels in to control global economies. Luckily many of Stan Meyer’s patents have expired, meaning they can now be found online in Google’s patent catalog. Maybe it’s time they’re reexamined, so we can resurrect the brilliance of this water-powered car inventor and disrupt the environmentally devastating toll the fossil fuel industry continues to inflict upon the plant",The Mysterious Death of Stanley Meyer and His Water-Powered Car,false
531,106661897367097985411022560344978077106,"A new NASA study, released on Friday, admits that ice is accumulating in Antarctica. Satellite measurements show an 82-112 gigaton-a-year net ice gain. That’s 82-112 billion tons per year! Nine zeroes! in other words that is 112,000,000,000 tons. Per year. It’s hard to comprehend how much ice that really is, so let’s put it in perspective. Let’s assume that they’re talking short tons (2,000 lbs). That’s about the weight of an old VW Beetle. Those old Beetles measured 14 feet long.  Multiply 112 billion by 14 feet and you get 1,560 billion feet. Divide that by the distance from the earth to the moon (239,000 miles),  and you’d have a string of VW Beetles stretching all the way to the moon. Not once, not twice, but 45 times.  All the way to the moon. That’s a helluva lot of new ice. Every single year. And we’re worried about global warming? Not only is the Antarctic Ice Sheet growing, NASA admits that the growth is actually reducing sea-level rise. This also confirms what I’ve been saying all along. Antarctica contains 90 percent of the earth’s ice. If the Antarctic Ice Sheet is growing, wouldn’t that mean that more than 90 percent of the world’s glaciers are growing? Here are excerpts, taken from NASA’s own website: “NASA – Antarctic Ice Sheet Is Growing” A new NASA study says that an increase in Antarctic snow accumulation that began 10,000 years ago is currently adding enough ice to the continent to outweigh the increased losses from its thinning glaciers. The research challenges the conclusions of other studies, including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) 2013 report, which says that Antarctica is overall losing land ice. According to the new analysis of satellite data, the Antarctic ice sheet showed a net gain of 112 billion tons of ice a year from 1992 to 2001. That net gain slowed to 82 billion tons of ice per year between 2003 and 2008. “We’re essentially in agreement with other studies that show an increase in ice discharge in the Antarctic Peninsula and the Thwaites and Pine Island region of West Antarctica,” said Jay Zwally, a glaciologist with NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and lead author of the study, which was published on Oct. 30 in the Journal of Glaciology. “Our main disagreement is for East Antarctica and the interior of West Antarctica – there, we see an ice gain that exceeds the losses in the other areas.”  Zwally added that his team “measured small height changes over large areas, as well as the large changes observed over smaller areas.” Scientists calculate how much the ice sheet is growing or shrinking from the changes in surface height that are measured by the satellite altimeters. In locations where the amount of new snowfall accumulating on an ice sheet is not equal to the ice flow downward and outward to the ocean, the surface height changes and the ice-sheet mass grows or shrinks. The study analyzed changes in the surface height of the Antarctic ice sheet measured by radar altimeters on two European Space Agency European Remote Sensing (ERS) satellites, spanning from 1992 to 2001, and by the laser altimeter on NASA’s Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) from 2003 to 2008. They also used information on snow accumulation for tens of thousands of years, derived by other scientists from ice cores, to conclude that East Antarctica has been thickening for a very long time. The extra snowfall that began 10,000 years ago has been slowly accumulating on the ice sheet and compacting into solid ice over millennia, thickening the ice in East Antarctica and the interior of West Antarctica by an average of 0.7 inches (1.7 centimeters) per year. “The good news is that Antarctica is not currently contributing to sea level rise, but is taking 0.23 millimeters per year away,” Zwally said.",Climate Shock: 90 Percent Of The World’s Glaciers Are GROWING,false
532,33111449036179445459438618664929500333,"The scientist widely known as the “Father of Global Warming” has admitted for the first time that data used to promote his climate change theory was false and fraudulently manipulated by Al Gore to suit an agenda. In 1988 the former NASA scientist, James Hansen, testified to Congress during a hearing on global warming organized by then-Congressman Al Gore to produce scientific models based on a number of different scenarios that could impact the planet. According to Hansen, Al Gore took the data provided in a “worst-case scenario” and intentionally twisted it, rebranding it as “Global Warming,” making tens of millions of dollars in the process. The model was titled “Scenario B” and was one of many provided to Congress by Hansen, however it left out significant factors meaning it didn’t reflect real-world conditions. This didn’t stop Al Gore and climate alarmists using the data to mislead millions of people all over the world. However a new study that compares real-world data to the original Scenario B model — finding no correlation — has received Hansen’s backing, with the “Father of global warming” admitting he is “devastated” by the way his data has been used by climate alarmists. Real World data shows “the science is not settled” The dire climate prediction that was taken from Hansen’s data model “significantly overstates the warming” observed in the real world since the 1980s, according to the new analysis. father-global-warming Dr. Ross McKitrick, says real world data shows no global warming has occured. Western Journal reports: Economist Ross McKitrick and climate scientist John Christy found observed warming trends match the low end of what Hansen told Congress during a hearing on global warming organized by then-Congressman Al Gore. “Climate modelers will object that this explanation doesn’t fit the theories about climate change,” the two wrote. “But those were the theories Hansen used, and they don’t fit the data. “The bottom line is, climate science as encoded in the models is far from settled.” Cato Institute climate scientists Patrick Michaels and Ryan Maue wrote that “surface temperatures are behaving as if we had capped 18 years ago the carbon-dioxide emissions responsible for the enhanced greenhouse effect.” “But we didn’t. And it isn’t just Mr. Hansen who got it wrong,” Michaels and Maue wrote in The Wall Street Journal in June. The WSJ op-ed set off a fierce debate over the accuracy of Hansen’s predictions. Several media reports interviewing climate scientists claimed Hansen’s predictions — issued in 1988 — were pretty much correct. Hansen’s dire global warming predictions turned 30 this year, sparking fawning media coverage of their accuracy. Hansen,  so-called “godfather” of global warming even told The Associated Press “I don’t want to be right in that sense.” Some scientists moved the goalposts and argued even though Hansen’s temperature predictions were off, he got the radiative forcing from greenhouse gas emissions correct. Al Gore took ‘worst-case scenario’ data, rebranded it as ‘Global Warming’, and became a multi-millionaire. However, McKitrick and Christy’s analysis takes into account such objections, pointing out that Hansen’s prediction of carbon dioxide emissions was actually close to what was observed — there just wasn’t much warming. It turns out Hansen’s worst-case scenario projection of global warming, known as Scenario B, only takes carbon dioxide emissions into account, but still showed too much warming, McKitrick and Christy wrote. “What really matters is the trend over the forecast interval, and this is where the problems become visible,” McKitrick and Christy wrote. Hansen’s conclusion, they wrote, “significantly overstates the warming.”",‘Father Of Global Warming’ Scientist Finally Admits Theory Is Wrong,false
533,74737498504619662302592388050491050102,"Recent research shows that the volume of volcanic CO2 currently being emitted into Earth’s atmosphere is far greater than previously calculated, challenging the validity of the man-made global warming theory. (above Figure 1.) Volcanic gas emissions breakthrough overlying fractured and partially melted glacial ice sheet. (Image credits: Christina Neal, AVO/USGS) The cornerstone principle of the global warming theory, anthropogenic global warming (AGW), is built on the premise that significant increases of modern era human-induced CO2 emissions have acted to unnaturally warm Earth’s atmosphere. A warmed atmosphere that directly, or in some cases indirectly fuels anomalous environmental disasters such as ocean warming, alteration of ocean chemistry, polar ice sheet melting, global sea level rise, coral bleaching and most importantly dramatic changes in climate. There are numerous major problems with the AGW principle. Identification of Volcanic vs. Man-made CO2 Natural volcanic and man-made CO2 emissions have the exact same and very distinctive carbon isotopic fingerprint. It is therefore scientifically impossible to distinguish the difference between volcanic CO2 and human-induced CO2 from the burning of fossil fuels (see here). This major problem with the AGW principle has been rationalized away by consensus climate scientists who insist, based supposedly reliable research, that volcanic emissions are minuscule in comparison to human-induced CO2 emissions (Gerlach 1991). Terrance Gerlach’s volcanic CO2 calculation was based on just 7 actively erupting land volcanoes and three actively erupting ocean floor hydrothermal vents (seafloor hot geysers). Utilizing gas emission data from this very limited number of volcanic features, Gerlach estimated that the volume of natural volcanic CO2 emissions is 100 to 150 times less than the volume of man-made CO2 emissions from the burning of fossil fuels and therefore of no consequence. To put this calculation process into perspective, the Earth is home to 1,500 land volcanoes and 900,000 seafloor volcanoes/hydrothermal vents. By sampling just an extremely small percent of these volcanic features it is impossible to imagine that the calculation is correct. Especially knowing that volcanic activity varies greatly from area to area, volcano to volcano, and through time. Utilizing just 0.001 percent (10/901,500) of Earth’s volcanic features to calculate volcanic CO2 emissions does not inspire confidence in the resulting value. Non-Erupting Volcanoes Can Emit Massive Amounts of CO2 into Earth’s Atmosphere Recent geological research by the University of Leeds and others proves that non-erupting volcanoes can emit massive amounts of CO2 into Earth’s atmosphere and oceans. The Gerlach calculation and all follow-up calculations utilized volcanic CO2 rates from actively erupting volcanoes. Lost in the numerous recent media articles concerning the argument of when, or if Iceland’s Katla Volcano will erupt is the discovery that this non-erupting subglacial volcano is currently emitting staggering amounts of CO2 into Earth’s atmosphere! Researchers from the University of Leeds who studied the Katla Volcano said this. “We discovered that Katla volcano in Iceland is a globally important source of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) in spite of being previously assumed to be a minor gas emitter. Volcanoes are a key natural source of atmospheric CO2 but estimates of the total global amount of CO2 that volcanoes emit are based on only a small number of active volcanoes. Very few volcanoes which are covered by glacial ice have been measured for gas emissions, probably because they tend to be difficult to access and often do not have obvious degassing vents. Through high‐precision airborne measurements and atmospheric dispersion modeling, we show that Katla, a highly hazardous subglacial volcano which last erupted 100 years ago, is one of the largest volcanic sources of CO2 on Earth, releasing up to 5% of total global volcanic emissions. This is significant in the context of a growing awareness that natural CO2 sources have to be more accurately quantified in climate assessments and we recommend urgent investigations of other subglacial volcanoes worldwide.”(see here) The Number of Volcanoes Emitting CO2 into the Atmosphere at Any One Time The calculation of the total yearly volume of volcanic CO2 emitted into the atmosphere is based on the presumption that very few volcanoes are erupting at any one time. Scientists from various worldwide volcano research institutions, most notably the United States Geological Survey, have estimated this number to be 20. This very low number has been challenged by many scientists including those at NASA. A  multinational team led by NASA has initiated a high-resolution satellite CO2 monitoring project (see here). This project is focused on determining how many geological features are emitting CO2 at any one time. This project may eventually give scientists a better idea of how many land volcanoes are emitting CO2 at any one time. However, it is doubtful the project will properly record ocean CO2 emissions from Earth’s 900,000 deep ocean floor and very difficult to monitor volcanic features. In any case, this project is certainly a step forward towards achieving a better understanding of the climate influence of volcanic CO2 emissions. The Amount of CO2 and heat infused into Earth’s Oceans by Seafloor Geological Features About 71% of Earth’s surface is covered by oceans making it a water, not land, planet. For many years now, scientists have contended that the nearly one million geological features present in these vast ocean regions have played a minimal role in heating and chemically charging ocean seawater. Instead of contending that man-made atmospheric CO2 was the root cause of changes to our oceans. underwater volcano Figure 2.) An underwater volcanic erupts in the Pacific Ocean (Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science—AP). Recent research has proven that the contentions of these scientists are far from 100% proven. To the contrary, it has become clear that geological heat flow and chemically charged heated fluid flow into our oceans is far more influential than previously thought and possibly the root cause of changes to our oceans. One example is that geological features are warming Earth’s oceans and causing El Nino’s and La Nina’s (see here, here, and here). Warmed seawater is not capable of holding as much CO2 as cold water. So, the geologically warming of seawater indirectly leads to a large amount of CO2 being released from oceans and emitted into the atmosphere. Recent research shows that seafloor geological features also directly emit large amounts of CO2 into our oceans and atmosphere(see here, here, here, and Figure 2). In summary, the volume of volcanic CO2 being emitted into the Earth’s atmosphere has not been accurately assessed. Numerous research studies and articles conducted/written by qualified scientists concur with this contention (see here, here, and here). In a geological time frame, Earth has gone through many periods of increased volcanism. These volcanic periods resulted in; major plant and animal extinction events (see here, here, and here), the end of glacial eras (see here) and the dramatic alteration of Earth’s climate (see here). All indications are that Earth is currently experiencing another period of strong volcanic activity which is acting to infuse CO2 into our atmosphere thereby challenging the validity of the global warming theory. Clearly, its time to put on hold all environmental action plans based on the cornerstone AGW principle of the global warming theory until additional geological CO2 emission research is conducted.",Discovery Of Massive Volcanic CO2 Emissions Discredits Global Warming Theory,false

535,17224867221337172956561334914316934475,"The annual data on coral cover for the Great Barrier Reef, produced by the Australian Institute of Marine Science, was released on Monday showing the amount of coral on the reef is at record high levels. Record high, despite all the doom stories by our reef science and management institutions. Like all other data on the reef, this shows it is in robust health. For example, coral growth rates have, if anything, increased over the past 100 years and measurements of farm pesticides reaching the reef show levels so low that they cannot be detected with the most ultra-sensitive equipment. This data is good news. It could hardly be better. But somehow, our science organisations have convinced the world that the reef is on its last legs. How has this happened? One reason is that occasionally colossal amounts of coral are killed, mostly by cyclones, but also by crown of thorns starfish and bleaching. So the media, with its predilection for bad news, can be fed a regular diet of doom. Our scientists are always happy to oblige. The quiet recovery is generally downplayed or ignored. Growing up in Innisfail, adjacent to the reef, in the early 1970s, I recall the initial doom stories about the reef. The scientific study of the reef had only just started, and plagues of starfish that eat the coral had just been discovered and were making headlines worldwide. The reef had, supposedly, only a decade left. It was reasonable in the ’70s to be concerned about these plagues and they ultimately precipitated AIMS’s long-term monitoring of coral and starfish in the ’80s. I was working at AIMS when this important work started, and it is interesting to look back on what has changed. The coral cover is no less, the number of starfish is no more, but the number of scientists and managers working on the reef has exploded. Perhaps this is the problem. In 50 years we have now learnt a great deal about the cycles of coral death and regrowth. The data reported every year by AIMS shows all areas go through these cycles every decade or two. Remarkably, even the excellent news of record coral still has the scientists pessimistic. The reef is, apparently, still doomed from climate change and this is just a temporary reprieve. How good does the data need to be to make them admit the reef is fine? The science institutions have been claiming that there have been three disastrous bleaching events in the past five years, which does not accord with the latest statistics. Record coral cover means there was no disaster on the reef. The only disaster is the quality assurance at the science organisations. An examination of the data shows that, while there have been three events, they occurred in largely different regions in each year. The reef has thus effectively had one major bleaching event in the past five years and the previous major event was in 2002. So the reef has had roughly one event in 15 years, and most of the coral on the reef did not bleach, and most that bleached did not die. Therefore, it is not surprising that the reef is in good shape. The science institutions have been caught out by their own deception. They exaggerated the bleaching events – as usual. Luckily, we have the AIMS long-term coral monitoring surveys, which are done professionally with good-quality protocols, to demonstrate the state of the reef. The bad news is that the record high coral cover means it is likely that coral cover will decline in the next few years. Prepare for the headlines saying the reef has lost much of its coral and is indicative of climate change and farmers polluting the reef. And the reef will be predicted to be gone by 2050 – or whenever. When will these doom stories about the reef, which have been going for 50 years, cease? Will it be like the Ancient Greek legend of Prometheus, who was chained alive to a rock so that his liver could be eaten by an eagle, only for the liver to grow overnight so that it could be eaten again and again? Will the agony ever end? According to legend, Heracles saved Prometheus. Who will be our Heracles, and support better quality assurance of the science? It should be the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, but so far it has not been interested. The various ministers could also take an interest. In the meantime, don’t forget we have record high levels of coral. It is time to stop scaring the children with doom stories about the reef",Science and media doomsayers ignore good news on reef,false
536,323227460357966615601120845837855078115,"he Great Barrier Reef is experiencing incredible growth — and the media are silent. The Australian government’s most recent official report on reef recovery indicates that coral cover at the Northern Great Barrier Reef “continued to increase to 27% from the most recent low point in 2017.” Meanwhile, the Central Great Barrier Reef saw a 26% increase in hard coral cover. Indeed, the study stated that over thirty-five years of monitoring, the Great Barrier Reef has consistently “shown an ability to recover after disturbances.” Nevertheless, coverage of the Great Barrier Reef from mainstream media outlets portray a starkly different narrative.The New York Times, for instance, reported in April 2018 that “an underwater heat wave that damaged huge sections of Australia’s Great Barrier Reef two years ago spurred a die-off of coral so severe that scientists say the natural wonder will never look the same again.” The article pushed governments to honor the Paris Climate Agreement; the author argued that by complying with the treaty, Australia will “still have the Great Barrier Reef in 50 years” — although it “would still look very different from today.” As recently as October 2020, The Washington Post ran an article called “Warming has killed half the coral on the Great Barrier Reef, study finds. It might never recover.” The piece argued that technological advancements meant to aid reef recovery “might not be enough for a country that continues to lead the world in exporting coal, a fossil fuel that contributes to warming, which hastens the decline of coral.” Indeed, Center for Industrial Progress Founder and President Alex Epstein noted that the mainstream media has been quick to cover the Great Barrier Reef’s decline — but not its rapid rebound. “The climate media’s evasion of the Great Barrier Reef improvement confirms that they have no interest in the truth about what’s happening with climate and why,” he said on Twitter. “They are interested in attacking fossil fuels, attacking capitalism, and justifying vast expansions of government power.” “Any science editor that covered the decline of the Great Barrier Reef but not its improvement” — including those at The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN, The Guardian, USA Today, and National Geographic — “should commit to correcting their failures or be pressured into resigning.” He also noted that celebrities such as Mark Ruffalo and Leonardo DiCaprio — who have publicly “catastrophized” about the Great Barrier Reef — should “celebrate, share the good news, and walk back their climate catastrophism.” “Why does it matter so much that the climate media only cover negative stories and ignore positive ones?” asked Epstein. “Because it contributes to deadly energy policy by catastrophizing the side-effects of the fossil fuels that modern life depends on, while ignoring their massive benefits.”","Despite Climate Change Fearmongering, Study Shows The Great Barrier Reef Is Growing Quickly",mixture

But Dr. Zelenko didn’t stop. He kept working — and found an over-the-counter way to help people. TRENDING: ""For the First Time We Were All Able to Sing the Star-Spangled Banner Together, We Sang it Loud and Proud"" - Exclusive: Patriots Speak Out from the Inside of DC ""GITMO"" - One Year After January 6 Watch: Here is Dr. Zelenko talk about “the bullet and gun” approach for understanding zinc ionophores (transcript of highlights is below): Dr Zelenko: The Gun & The Bullet, Breaking Down The Protocol And Immune Support Here is a transcript of highlights from the video: Dr. Zelenko: “Zinc is the bullet – it kills the virus. The only problem is the bullet doesn’t get to the place where it needs to be. The virus is inside the cell. The enzyme is inside the cell. And the zinc on its own cannot get into the cell. You have a bullet without a gun – useless. Now, it turns out there’s a class of medications called ‘zinc ionophores’ or a class of substances called ‘zinc ionophores’ — what they do — is they open up a channel, a door, which allows zinc to go from outside the cell to inside the cell. There are four of them that are readily available – two of them are prescription and two of them are over-the-counter. The two prescription ones everyone has heard of: Hydroxycholorquine and Ivermection. They’re the guns that shoot the bullet. The bullet then gets into the cell and stops the virus enzyme from helping the virus replicate. So you have a gun and bullet. Only the synergy of the two creates a functioning unit. S in april of last year, Cuomo issued an executive order that was directly targeting me and my patients – because I was the only one in the state doing it. Where pharmacies would not dispense hydroxychloroquine to patients. So all of a sudden, I had a gun and a bullet approach, but…he took away the zinc delivery system — at least he took away access to my patients. So I was forced by necessity to innovate. I did more research, and on the NIH servers of all places, I found papers saying a substance called quercetin is a zinc delivery system, as well. It’s a zinc ionophore. To be honest, I’d never heard of quercetin. So I googled it and I see it’s over-the-counter. That was one of the most significant realizations in my life and probably in humanity. Why do I say that? Because now there was a cure for tyranny. There are two risk factors for dying from COVID: It’s the doctor you choose and the government you live under. Besides that, there’s no reason a person should die from COVID. Now, you don’t need a doctor and now you don’t need permission from the government. You can go to a pharmacy or go to a supermarket and buy an over-the-counter option of quercetin together with Zinc and Vitamin C and Vitamin D. Together it creates a very powerful immune-boosting nutritional supplement. According to the FDA, I’m not allowed to make any claims except that it’s an immune booster and nutritional supplement. So what I’m going to say is the following: Quercetin and Vitamin C together form a functioning zinc ionophore — a zinc delivery system. Zinc is what it delivers, so you actually need zinc as well. You need the gun and the bullet. And Vitamin D – the studies all show – Vitamin D3 levels between 50 and 70 virtually eliminate hospitalizations or admissions in the intensive care unit. It optimizes their immune system..so you need Vitamin D, then you need Zinc, which is the bullet. And then to form a functioning gun, you need Vitamin C and quercetin… Patients were having trouble sourcing it, because it was four different ingredients that weren’t always available in the same place. They had trouble finding the right doses. It was a puzzle that was a little too complex for people to put together. So I was asked as a necessity — as a favor to people — to produce something that has everything in one package. It made sense to me, so with the help of my colleagues, we were able to produce a substance — a compound called Z-Stack — that has Vitamin C, Vitamin D, and most importantly has quercetin and zinc.” Now, Dr. Zelenko is now making Z-Stack available to everyone.

""If you had a positive COVID test in the past, then you had a 99.3 percent chance of having circulating antibodies against COVID, and those antibodies were present up to 20 months, nearly two years after the infection,"" explained Dr. Marty Makary on ""Washington Watch."" The antibodies could last longer, but ""that's as long as the infection has been around."" For millions of Americans who have recovered from COVID-19, this is good news. But there couldn't be worse news for Dr. Fauci, or as some believe him to be, Science Incarnate. Since early in the pandemic, the National Institutes of Health have discounted natural immunity because, they said, its duration was unknown. That's the public health equivalent of recommending soldiers not carry guns into combat because they might jam unpredictably. Over a year later, the federally-backed funding behemoth still has never bothered to study the question. ""Why am I doing this study,"" asked Makary, a professor at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine & School of Public Health, ""when the NIH has $42 billion and could have done this study instantly?"" He suggested the answer is, ""they don't want to know the results."" The conclusions of the Johns Hopkins study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, are far from ""fringe."" Israeli data have shown natural immunity to be 27 times more protective than vaccines, but Mr. Science ignored that data, preferring instead to extrapolate a policy decision from other Israeli data, released around the same time, which showed booster shots could reduce the risk of hospitalization for older people. ""You cannot cherry pick the science,"" Makary protested. Makary is concerned with the exclusive club of medical experts who are both advising the Biden administration on policy and controlling the purse strings for scientific grants to allow others to conduct research. ""They just talk among themselves,"" he said. A FOIA request has revealed that in October 2020, Fauci colluded with NIH Director Francis Collins to discredit with ""a quick and devastating published take down"" Stanford epidemiologist Jay Bhattacharya and other authors of the Great Barrington Declaration, who advocated for natural immunity and targeted protection for vulnerable groups. Fauci's ilk ""are living in their own bubble,"" Makary said. ""They're not even thinking about an exit of the pandemic."" To determine U.S. policy on natural immunity, they held a ""small vote among some of their experts... The vote was split, and they decided not to recognize it."" Note that this split vote was the ""scientific consensus"" with which dissenting opinions were so ruthlessly de-platformed, ridiculed, and cancelled in the early months of lockdowns. The self-proclaimed experts knew that Americans wouldn't tolerate lockdowns if their flimsy scientific basis was widely known. ""This should not be an oligarchy,"" argued Makary. ""This should be an open scientific debate."" ""The science is now heavily curated,"" continued Makary. ""The CDC's own study on natural immunity... showed natural immunity was three times more protective [against hospitalization] than vaccinated immunity."" But that's not what their conclusion said. They wrote that ""vaccination is still the safest strategy. But that's not what the data show,"" he said.

One of these statements is the truth and the other is a falsehood. Which one is it? According to Healthline, Delta can affect you even if you’ve been vaccinated: With the rapid spread of the delta variant in the United States, coronavirus cases are spiking in parts of the country, especially in areas with low COVID-19 vaccination rates. This has led to surges in COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths, largely among people who are not fully vaccinated. In fact, nearly all COVID-19 deaths in the United States are now among the unvaccinated, according to an analysis by the Associated Press. At a White House briefing on June 22, Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said most of these deaths were “entirely preventable.” Although fully vaccinated people have a much lower risk of severe illness, their health could still be impacted as COVID-19 surges send ripples throughout the healthcare system, something we’ve seen throughout the pandemic. In addition, children under 12 years old are not yet eligible for vaccination, which leaves them at risk — albeit a smaller risk than adults — of illness, hospitalization, and other complications of coronavirus infection. Increased hospitalizations in some parts of the United States are driven by the fast-spreading delta variant and low vaccination rates in those areas. Overall, 53.8 percent of all people in the United States have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, according to the CDC. But in some states in the South and West, the one-dose rates are below 40 percent. The situation is even more dire in certain counties in these areas.

This was due to the country’s “worst-case scenario” epidemic at the time according to officials. Indonesia experienced a spike in COVID-19 infection and deaths in July and was struggling to slow the virus transmission due to its high population.  Indonesia is ranked as the world’s fourth most populous country. The Indonesian government on Thursday (July 15) began distributing free medicine and vitamins to self-isolating Covid-19 patients in high-risk areas as the highly transmissible Delta variant of the coronavirus continued to rip through the country, emptying pharmacy shelves. Each package will have seven days worth of therapeutic Covid-19 drugs and vitamins, and will be given to asymptomatic patients as well as those with mild to moderate symptoms including fever and dry cough. The medication for the latter group will require consultation with a doctor and a prescription. Medical facilities are stretched thin, and demand for oxygen and medication has also soared. As scores of people are isolating themselves at home and self-medicating, prices of drugs have shot up in pharmacies and online. The health ministry has since moved to cap the prices of drugs such as favipiravir, remdesivir and ivermectin. Indonesia’s food and drug agency has authorised ivermectin for emergency use against Covid-19, Reuters reported, although the World Health Organisation, as well as European and the US regulators did not recommend its use for Covid-19 patients. After the government authorized the use of Ivermectin for COVID-19 patients, the number of cases significantly plummeted since July. As of October 8, only 20.5% were fully vaccinated and 35.9% got their first dose.

Their report was published in 2008. They reported that twenty-five children died during the drug studies, that an additional fifty-five children died following the studies (in foster care), and, according to Tim Ross, Director of the Child Welfare program at VERA (as of 2009), 29% of the remaining 417 children who were used in drug studies had died (out of a total 532 children that are admitted to have been used).

The predominance of antibody-resistant SARS-CoV-2 variants in vaccine breakthrough cases from the San Francisco Bay Area, California. [DATA LINK HERE] The California study finds that vaccinated individuals are more susceptible to COVID variant infections than unvaccinated.  Geer Vanden Bossche has been warning that vaccine antibodies would suppress natural antibody responses.  The vaccine antibodies take control of the immune system and defend only against a targeted virus. Among vaccinated individuals, a COVID variant virus is not recognized by the specialized antibodies provided by the vaccine, and the natural antibodies have been programmed to stand down. (MedRxiv) Associations between vaccine breakthrough cases and infection by SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants have remained largely unexplored. Here we analyzed SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequences and viral loads from 1,373 persons with COVID-19 from the San Francisco Bay Area from February 1 to June 30, 2021, of which 125 (9.1%) were vaccine breakthrough infections. Fully vaccinated were more likely than unvaccinated persons to be infected by variants carrying mutations associated with decreased antibody neutralization. […] These findings suggest that vaccine breakthrough cases are preferentially caused by circulating antibody-resistant SARS-CoV-2 variants, and that symptomatic breakthrough infections may potentially transmit COVID-19 as efficiently as unvaccinated infections. (read more) Be careful around vaccinated people, because they can carry a more resistant form of COVID-19.  Additionally, the highly specialized antibodies in the vaccine create a need for a booster for each antibody resistant variant.  Israel is already on booster #2. Dr. Vanden Bossche has been using Israeli data and showing how the widespread vaccination rates were creating pressure on the virus to mutate into variants with higher levels of contagion. The unvaccinated group has been keeping the pressure down by defeating the virus and carrying natural immunity. However, as the unvaccinated population is increasingly made smaller, the pressure on the virus to mutate increases. Subsequently, these mutations stay at higher or more effective levels of infection. Israel is already on its second round of booster shots. The long term impacts of antibody dependency are unknown.  Some doctors and scientists are already worried that normal cancer fighting antibodies will become dormant and we could see an explosion of unusual cancer clusters due to antibody suppression caused by the COVID vaccines. [Diminished natural killer cells] Remember, no one knows exactly what this targeted vaccine will do to the overall human immune system as it responds to other viruses or infections.  The vaccinated population are the human trial subjects, and the unvaccinated population are the control group. In the U.K. data study there were: 157,400 Delta variant cases amid the fully vaccinated (26.52% of total cases), and 257,357 Delta variant cases amid the unvaccinated (43.36% of total cases).

A groundbreaking preprint paper by the prestigious Oxford University Clinical Research Group, published Aug. 10 in The Lancet, includes alarming findings devastating to the COVID vaccine rollout. The study found vaccinated individuals carry 251 times the load of COVID-19 viruses in their nostrils compared to the unvaccinated. While moderating the symptoms of infection, the jab allows vaccinated individuals to carry unusually high viral loads without becoming ill at first, potentially transforming them into presymptomatic superspreaders. This phenomenon may be the source of the shocking post-vaccination surges in heavily vaccinated populations globally. The paper’s authors, Chau et al, demonstrated widespread vaccine failure and transmission under tightly controlled circumstances in a hospital lockdown in Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam. ORDER TODAY: Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.'s New Book — 'The Real Anthony Fauci' The scientists studied healthcare workers who were unable to leave the hospital for two weeks. The data showed that fully vaccinated workers — about two months after injection with the Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine (AZD1222) — acquired, carried and presumably transmitted the Delta variant to their vaccinated colleagues. They almost certainly also passed the Delta infection to susceptible unvaccinated people, including their patients. Sequencing of strains confirmed the workers transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to one another. This is consistent with the observations in the U.S. from Farinholt and colleagues, and congruent with comments by the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conceding COVID-19 vaccines have failed to stop transmission of SARS-CoV-2. On Feb. 11, the World Health Organization indicated the AZD1222 vaccine efficacy of 63.09% against the development of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. The conclusions of the Chau paper support the warnings by leading medical experts that the partial, non-sterilizing immunity from the three notoriously “leaky” COVID-19 vaccines allow carriage of 251 times the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 as compared to samples from the pre-vaccination era in 2020. Thus, we have a key piece to the puzzle explaining why the Delta outbreak is so formidable — fully vaccinated are participating as COVID-19 patients and acting as powerful Typhoid Mary-style super-spreaders of the infection. Vaccinated individuals are blasting out concentrated viral explosions into their communities and fueling new COVID surges. Vaccinated healthcare workers are almost certainly infecting their coworkers and patients, causing horrendous collateral damage. Continued vaccination will only make this problem worse, particularly among frontline doctors and nurses workers who are caring for vulnerable patients. Health systems should drop vaccine mandates immediately, take stock of COVID-19 recovered workers who are robustly immune to Delta and consider the ramifications of their current vaccinated healthcare workers as potential threats to high risk patients and coworkers.","Study: Fully Vaccinated Healthcare Workers Carry 251 Times Viral Load, Pose Threat to Unvaccinated Patients, Co-Workers",other

The study findings reveal that individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection do not get additional benefits from vaccination, indicating that COVID-19 vaccines should be prioritized to individuals without prior infection. The study is currently available on the medRxiv* preprint server.ackground In the United States, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has provided emergency use authorization for two mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, which have shown high efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease in clinical trials. However, the ability to vaccinate a large part of the global population is limited by vaccine supply. In order to ensure fair access to vaccines throughout the world, the COVID-19 vaccines Global Access (COVAX) initiative was launched. In many countries, especially those with low socioeconomic status, there is a serious shortage of vaccines. Thus, in order to get the maximum vaccine benefits, the most vulnerable population should be prioritized for the vaccination. Currently, most countries prioritize vaccination for healthcare and other frontline workers, elderly people, and people with comorbidities. To further narrow down the prioritization criteria, the scientists in the current study have evaluated the necessity of COVID-19 vaccines for individuals who were previously infected with SARS-CoV-2.

Explanation of “previously infected” analyzed as a time-independent covariate and “vaccinated” treated as a time-dependent covariate. Study design The study was conducted on 52,238 employees in the Cleveland Clinic. A positive RT-PCR test was considered to define SARS-CoV-2 infection. The participants received two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine at an interval of 28 days. A participant was considered vaccinated after 14 days of receiving the 2nd vaccine dose. Similarly, a participant who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at least 42 days before the vaccination initiation was considered previously infected. Important observations Of all enrolled participants, 5% had previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Compared to 59% of non-infected participants, only 47% of previously infected participants were vaccinated by the end of the study. About 63% of all vaccinated participants received the Moderna vaccine. The analysis of cumulative COVID-19 incidence revealed that during the course of the study, SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred almost exclusively in participants who were not previously infected and were not vaccinated. Interestingly, no significant difference in COVID-19 incidence was observed between previously infected and currently unvaccinated participants, previously infected and currently vaccinated participants, and previously uninfected and currently vaccinated participants. The participants from these three groups exhibited a significantly lower incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to previously uninfected and currently unvaccinated participants. Specifically, of all infections during the study period, 99.3% occurred in participants who were not infected previously and remained unvaccinated. In contrast, only 0.7% of infections occurred in participants who were not previously infected but were currently vaccinated.

After baiting millions of people into getting jabbed on the promise that life would return back to “normal” if they did, the CDC now admits that being “fully vaccinated” does not actually fight the “delta variant,” but instead contributes to more infections. Because of this, the CDC now wants all injected people to put back on their masks just like before they were vaccinated. Fauci Flu shots, the CDC now admits, are more symbolic than anything else. People who refuse to get them are just as safe and protected against Chinese Germs as those who did, is the short of it. So much for “science.” “In areas with substantial and high transmission,” announced CDC head Rochelle Walensky, vaccinated people should mask up to “help prevent the spread of the delta variant and protect others.” In other words, just because you got vaccinated does not mean that you are immune from killing grandma, according to Walensky. The medical establishment is a death cult This is a complete about-face from what Walensky was saying just a few months ago when the CDC ruled that injected people no longer had to wear masks. In fact, Walensky had adamantly pushed the notion, as did Tony Fauci, that vaccinated people were incapable of spreading the Chinese Disease. All of that has since changed, now that millions of Americans took the bait and got jabbed in accordance with the government’s earlier guidelines. This big oopsie means that countless people permanently modified their DNA with mRNA chemicals in vain. “Information on the Delta variant from several states and other countries indicates that, on rare occasions, some vaccinated people infected with the Delta variant after vaccination may be contagious and spread the virus to others,” Walensky stated during a press call. “This new science is worrisome and unfortunately warrants an update to our recommendations.” What is truly worrisome is the fact that these so-called “experts” got things so wrong that they are now saying the exact opposite of what they said earlier. It is one thing to be a little bit wrong, but they were really, really wrong – so wrong that they, in fact, lied to the world and are now blaming “evolving science” for their deception. Walensky further admitted during the call that vaccinated people carry the same potential viral load as unvaccinated people. This also goes against what she and other “authorities” said just weeks ago when they claimed that unvaccinated people carry a higher potential viral load, and are thus more “dangerous” to society. Walensky has yet to fully come out and admit that the Trump Vaccines are actively spreading the Chinese Virus, but with the way things have been going lately, that could be the next order of business in this bizarro world. Other lies still being told by Walensky include the notion that the “vast majority of transmission” of the Wuhan Flu is occurring “almost exclusively” among “unvaccinated people.” She also falsely claims that unvaccinated people represent 97 percent of all new Chinese Virus hospitalization cases, which is completely made-up.",CDC confesses to COVID-19 “vaccines” being a medical HOAX… vaxxed individuals shown to have HIGHER viral loads and can be super-spreaders,false

551,181643985326372854367182851926240682274,"Editor’s Note: This article has been amended to note that 11 of 13 vaccinated subjects in a recent Ogata study had detectable protein from SARS coronavirus in their bloodstream including three people who had measurable spike protein. Whereas the article referenced a statement from Professor Bridle's group stating that spike protein was present for 29 days in one person, the study in question states that spike protein was found in the person on Day 29,  one day after a second vaccine injection with and was undetectable two days later. May 31, 2021 (LifeSiteNews) — New research shows that the coronavirus spike protein from COVID-19 vaccination unexpectedly enters the bloodstream, which is a plausible explanation for thousands of reported side-effects from blood clots and heart disease to brain damage and reproductive issues, a Canadian cancer vaccine researcher said last week. “We made a big mistake. We didn’t realize it until now,” said Byram Bridle, a viral immunologist and associate professor at University of Guelph, Ontario, in an interview with Alex Pierson last Thursday, in which he warned listeners that his message was “scary.” “We thought the spike protein was a great target antigen, we never knew the spike protein itself was a toxin and was a pathogenic protein. So by vaccinating people we are inadvertently inoculating them with a toxin,” Bridle said on the show, which is not easily found in a Google search but went viral on the internet this weekend. Bridle, a vaccine researcher who was awarded a $230,000 government grant last year for research on COVID vaccine development, said that he and a group of international scientists filed a request for information from the Japanese regulatory agency to get access to what’s called the “biodistribution study.” “It’s the first time ever scientists have been privy to seeing where these messenger RNA [mRNA] vaccines go after vaccination,” said Bridle. “Is it a safe assumption that it stays in the shoulder muscle? The short answer is: absolutely not. It’s very disconcerting.”  SUBSCRIBE to LifeSite's daily headlines Email address SUBSCRIBE U.S. Canada World Catholic Vaccine researchers had assumed that novel mRNA COVID vaccines would behave like “traditional” vaccines and the vaccine spike protein — responsible for infection and its most severe symptoms — would remain mostly in the vaccination site at the shoulder muscle. Instead, the Japanese data showed that the infamous spike protein of the coronavirus gets into the blood where it circulates for several days post-vaccination and then accumulated in organs and tissues including the spleen, bone marrow, the liver, adrenal glands, and in “quite high concentrations” in the ovaries. “We have known for a long time that the spike protein is a pathogenic protein. It is a toxin. It can cause damage in our body if it gets into circulation,” Bridle said. The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is what allows it to infect human cells. Vaccine manufacturers chose to target the unique protein, making cells in the vaccinated person manufacture the protein which would then, in theory, evoke an immune response to the protein, preventing it from infecting cells. A large number of studies has shown that the most severe effects of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, such as blood clotting and bleeding, are due to the effects of the spike protein of the virus itself “What has been discovered by the scientific community is the spike protein on its own is almost entirely responsible for the damage to the cardiovascular system, if it gets into circulation,” Bridle told listeners. Lab animals injected with purified spike protein into their bloodstream developed cardiovascular problems, and the spike protein was also demonstrated to cross the blood brain barrier and cause damage to the brain. A grave mistake, according to Bridle, was the belief that the spike protein would not escape into the blood circulation. “Now, we have clear-cut evidence that the vaccines that make the cells in our deltoid muscles manufacture this protein — that the vaccine itself, plus the protein — gets into blood circulation,” he said. Bridle cited the recent study which detected SARS-CoV-2 protein in the blood plasma of 11 of 13 young healthcare workers that had received Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine, including three with detectable levels of spike protein. A 'subunit' protein called S1, part of the spike protein, was also detected. Spike protein was detected an average of 15 days after the first injection. One patient had spike protein detectable on day 29, one day after an injection, which disappeared two days later. Effects on heart and brain Once in circulation, the spike protein can attach to specific ACE2 receptors that are on blood platelets and the cells that line blood vessels. “When that happens it can do one of two things: it can either cause platelets to clump, and that can lead to clotting. That’s exactly why we’ve been seeing clotting disorders associated with these vaccines. It can also lead to bleeding.” Bridle also said the spike protein in circulation would explain recently reported heart problems in youths who had received the shots. “The results of this leaked Pfizer study tracing the biodistribution of the vaccine mRNA are not surprising, but the implications are terrifying,” Stephanie Seneff, a senior research scientist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told LifeSiteNews. “It is now clear” that vaccine content is being delivered to the spleen and the glands, including the ovaries and the adrenal glands. “The released spike protein is being shed into the medium and then eventually reaches the bloodstream causing systemic damage. ACE2 receptors are common in the heart and brain, and this is how the spike protein causes cardiovascular and cognitive problems,” Seneff said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently announced it was studying reports of “mild” heart conditions following COVID-19 vaccination, and last week 18 teenagers in the state of Connecticut alone were hospitalized for heart problems that developed shortly after they took COVID-19 vaccines. AstraZeneca’s vaccine was halted in a number of countries and is no longer recommended for younger people because of its link to life-threatening and fatal blood clots, but mRNA COVID vaccines have been linked to hundreds of reports of blood clotting events as well. ON Point with Alex Pierson New peer reviewed study on COVID-19 vaccines suggests why heart inflammation, blood clots and other dangerous side effects occur New peer reviewed study on COVID-19 vaccines suggests why heart inflammation, blood clots and other dangerous side effects occur 00:00 / 09:11 FDA warned of spike protein danger Pediatric rheumatologist J. Patrick Whelan had warned a vaccine advisory committee of the Food and Drug Administration of the potential for the spike protein in COVID vaccines to cause microvascular damage causing damage to the liver, heart, and brain in “ways that were not assessed in the safety trials.” While Whelan did not dispute the value of a coronavirus vaccine that worked to stop transmission of the disease (which no COVID vaccine in circulation has been demonstrated to do), he said, “it would be vastly worse if hundreds of millions of people were to suffer long-lasting or even permanent damage to their brain or heart microvasculature as a result of failing to appreciate in the short-term an unintended effect of full-length spike protein-based vaccines on other organs.” Vaccine-associated spike protein in blood circulation could explain myriad reported adverse events from COVID vaccines, including the 4,000 deaths to date, and nearly 15,000 hospitalizations, reported to the U.S. government’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) as of May 21, 2021. Because it is a passive reporting system, these reports are likely only the tip of an iceberg of adverse events since a Harvard Pilgrim Healthcare study found that less than one percent of side-effects that physicians should report in patients following vaccination are in fact reported to VAERS.Bridle said the discovery of vaccine-induced spike protein in blood circulation would have implications for blood donation programs. “We don’t want transfer of these pathogenic spike proteins to fragile patients who are being transfused with that blood,” he said. The vaccine scientist also said the findings suggested that nursing babies whose mothers had been vaccinated were at risk of getting COVID spike proteins from her breast milk. Bridle said that “any proteins in the blood will get concentrated in breast milk,” and “we have found evidence of suckling infants experiencing bleeding disorders in the gastrointestinal tract” in VAERS. Although Bridle did not cite it, one VAERS report describes a five-month-old breastfed infant whose mother received a second dose of Pfizer’s vaccine in March. The following day, the baby developed a rash and became “inconsolable,” refused to nurse, and developed a fever. The report says the baby was hospitalized with a diagnosis of Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura, a rare blood disorder in which blood clots form in small blood vessels throughout the body. The baby died. The new research also has “serious implications for people for whom SARS Coronavirus 2 is not a high risk pathogen, and that includes all of our children.” Effect on fertility and pregnancy? The high concentration of spike protein found in testes and ovaries in the secret Pfizer data released by the Japanese agency raises questions, too. “Will we be rendering young people infertile?” Bridle asked. There have been thousands of reports of menstrual disorders by women who had taken a COVID-19 shot, and hundreds of reports of miscarriage in vaccinated pregnant women, as well as of disorders of reproductive organs in men. Vicious smear campaign In response to a request, Bridle emailed a statement to LifeSiteNews on Monday morning, stating that since the radio interview he had received hundreds of positive emails. He added, too, that “a vicious smear campaign has been initiated against me. This included the creation of a libelous website using my domain name.” “Such are the times that an academic public servant can no longer answer people’s legitimate questions with honesty and based on science without fear of being harassed and intimidated,” Brindle wrote. “However, it is not in my nature to allow scientific facts to be hidden from the public.” He attached a brief report outlining the key scientific evidence supporting what he said in the interview. It was written with his colleagues in the Canadian COVID Care Alliance (CCCA) — a group of independent Canadian doctors, scientists, and professionals whose declared aim is “to provide top quality, evidence-based information about COVID-19, intent on reducing hospitalizations and saving more lives.” A focus of the statement was the risk to children and teens who are the target of the latest vaccine marketing strategies, including in Canada. As of May 28, 2021, there have been 259,308 confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Canadians 19 years and under. Of these, 0.048% were hospitalized, but only 0.004% died, according to the CCCA statement. “Seasonal influenza is associated with more severe illness than COVID-19.” Given the small number of young research subjects in Pfizer’s vaccine trials and the limited duration of clinical trials, the CCCA said questions about the spike protein and another vaccine protein must be answered before children and teens are vaccinated, including whether the vaccine spike protein crosses the blood-brain barrier, whether the vaccine spike protein interferes with semen production or ovulation, and whether the vaccine spike protein crosses the placenta and impacts a developing baby or is in breast milk. LifeSiteNews sent the Public Health Agency of Canada the statement of CCCA and asked for a response to Bridle’s concerns. The agency responded that it was working on the questions but did not send answers before publication time. Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson did not respond to questions about Bridle’s concerns. Pfizer did not respond to questions about how long the company was aware of its research data that the Japanese agency had released, showing spike protein in organs and tissue of vaccinated individuals.","Vaccine researcher admits ‘big mistake,’ says spike protein is dangerous ‘toxin’",mixture

An immediate halt to the vaccination programme is required whilst a full and independent safety analysis is undertaken to investigate the full extent of the harms, which the UK Yellow Card data suggest include thromboembolism, multisystem inflammatory disease, immune suppression, autoimmunity and anaphylaxis, as well as Antibody Dependent Enhancement (ADE).” The report concludes: “The MHRA now has more than enough evidence on the Yellow Card system to declare the COVID-19 vaccines unsafe for use in humans. Preparation should be made to scale up humanitarian efforts to assist those harmed by the COVID-19 vaccines and to anticipate and ameliorate medium to longer term effects. As the mechanism for harms from the vaccines appears to be similar to COVID-19 itself, this includes engaging with numerous international doctors and scientists with expertise in successfully treating COVID-19. “There are at least 3 urgent questions that need to be answered by the MHRA: How many people have died within 28 days of vaccination? How many people have been hospitalised within 28 days of vaccination? How many people have been disabled by the vaccination?”",‘Urgent’ British report calls for complete cessation of COVID vaccines in humans,mixture
553,82486226558981673771368453396111560966,"The US Center for Disease Control (CDC) is altering its practices of data logging and testing for “Covid19” in order to make it seem the experimental gene-therapy “vaccines” are effective at preventing the alleged disease. They made no secret of this, announcing the policy changes on their website in late April/early May, (though naturally without admitting the fairly obvious motivation behind the change). The trick is in their reporting of what they call “breakthrough infections” – that is people who are fully “vaccinated” against Sars-Cov-2 infection, but get infected anyway. Essentially, Covid19 has long been shown – to those willing to pay attention – to be an entirely created pandemic narrative built on two key factors: 1False-postive tests. The unreliable PCR test can be manipulated into reporting a high number of false-positives by altering the cycle threshold (CT value) 2Inflated Case-count. The incredibly broad definition of “Covid case”, used all over the world, lists anyone who receives a positive test as a “Covid19 case”, even if they never experienced any symptoms. Without these two policies, there would never have been an appreciable pandemic at all, and now the CDC has enacted two policy changes which means they no longer apply to vaccinated people. Firstly, they are lowering their CT value when testing samples from suspected “breakthrough infections”. From the CDC’s instructions for state health authorities on handling “possible breakthrough infections” (uploaded to their website in late April): “ For cases with a known RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) value, submit only specimens with Ct value ≤28 to CDC for sequencing. (Sequencing is not feasible with higher Ct values.) Throughout the pandemic, CT values in excess of 35 have been the norm, with labs around the world going into the 40s. Essentially labs were running as many cycles as necessary to achieve a positive result, despite experts warning that this was pointless (even Fauci himself said anything over 35 cycles is meaningless). But NOW, and only for fully vaccinated people, the CDC will only accept samples achieved from 28 cycles or fewer. That can only be a deliberate decision in order to decrease the number of “breakthrough infections” being officially recorded. Secondly, asymptomatic or mild infections will no longer be recorded as “covid cases”. That’s right. Even if a sample collected at the low CT value of 28 can be sequenced into the virus alleged to cause Covid19, the CDC will no longer be keeping records of breakthrough infections that don’t result in hospitalisation or death. From their website: “ As of May 1, 2021, CDC transitioned from monitoring all reported vaccine breakthrough cases to focus on identifying and investigating only hospitalized or fatal cases due to any cause. This shift will help maximize the quality of the data collected on cases of greatest clinical and public health importance. Previous case counts, which were last updated on April 26, 2021, are available for reference only and will not be updated moving forward. Just like that, being asymptomatic – or having only minor symptoms – will no longer count as a “Covid case” but only if you’ve been vaccinated. The CDC has put new policies in place which effectively created a tiered system of diagnosis. Meaning, from now on, unvaccinated people will find it much easier to be diagnosed with Covid19 than vaccinated people. Consider… Person A has not been vaccinated. They test positive for Covid using a PCR test at 40 cycles and, despite having no symptoms, they are officially a “covid case”. Person B has been vaccinated. They test positive at 28 cycles, and spend six weeks bedridden with a high fever. Because they never went into a hospital and didn’t die they are NOT a Covid case. Person C, who was also vaccinated, did die. After weeks in hospital with a high fever and respiratory problems. Only their positive PCR test was 29 cycles, so they’re not officially a Covid case either. The CDC is demonstrating the beauty of having a “disease” that can appear or disappear depending on how you measure it. To be clear: If these new policies had been the global approach to “Covid” since December 2019, there would never have been a pandemic at all. If you apply them only to the vaccinated, but keep the old rules for the unvaccinated, the only possible result can be that the official records show “Covid” is much more prevalent among the latter than the former. This is a policy designed to continuously inflate one number, and systematically minimise the other. What is that if not an obvious and deliberate act of deception?       ",How the CDC is manipulating data to prop-up “vaccine effectiveness”,false
554,115861246182543293909142883694767979285,"As most of my followers on social media and Substack must know by now, I have spent a considerable amount of time the last two years trying to discover the actual ingredients of the new COVID vaccines. The reason is simple: Big Pharma has gone to considerable trouble to hide them. Do the Big Pharma companies want to submit the vaccines to independent analysis? They do not! Do the Big Pharma companies want to disclose all the ingredients? They do not! Do the Big Pharma companies have any liability for lying to the public about the proprietary ingredients in their vaccines? They do not. We have a leaked copy of the legal agreement that Big Pharma companies (allegedly) have forced nation-states to sign in order to get the new COVID vaccines. These contracts include indemnification clauses that no sane human being would ever sign. This copy leaked from Albania: One thing is certain: Big Pharma is not standing behind these products. They’re totally experimental and untested and so forth — so why are the world’s governments so hellbent on injecting their citizens with this stuff? I received a tip regarding some of these ingredients, and so I did what nobody in American corporate journalism does anymore: I checked the primary sources. Allow me to share my secret and very profound methodology: 1) I went to the MODERNA website. 2) I clicked to the PATENTS page. 3) I found PATENT US 10,703,789 4) I conducted a keyword search for something called: Luciferase. Such are the complex technical skills which have been lost by corporate journalists. So what did I find there? Well, sitting on page 46 in table 4, you will see that I found something called Luciferase: What’s Luciferase? Luciferase is an enzyme that can produce bioluminescence. (It can make things glow, basically.) That’s why Luciferase is commonly used in the biomedical industry. It’s used to tag very tiny things like cells or proteins so that you can track them. It tags things so you can track them. Was Luciferase listed as an ingredient in the COVID vaccines by Big Pharma? No it was not. (You can check here at the CDC website.) So the next question becomes: why would Big Pharma not disclose that Luciferase is an ingredient in the vaccines - since it’s clearly listed (in at least one patent from one company) as being used? The reason is rather ominous: Big Pharma has big plans for Luciferase and Big Government has big plans for it too. The U.S. military’s technology arm DARPA is currently fighting with Moderna over the ownership of the COVID vaccine because DARPA has “funded an implantable biochip” that could be used “to deploy” it: Despite this, however, one obstacle to the deployment of Moderna’s vaccine is the method of delivery. While Moderna is developing its own system, it’s unlikely to get Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval any time soon. Enter Profusa, which is developing a nanoscale biochip that can detect symptoms of an infection. Profusa’s biochip is made using a technology called “hydrogels” that were a product of the “In Vivo Nanoplatforms” (IVN) program that DARPA’s Biological Technologies Office (BTO) launched in 2014 to develop implantable nanotechnologies. These hydrogels are soft, flexible nanomachines that are injected beneath the skin to perform monitoring. This hydrogel includes a specially engineered molecule that sends a fluorescent signal outside the body when it begins to fight infection. This signal can then be detected by a sensor attached to the skin that can then be sent to an app or even to a doctor’s website. Why is the U.S. military working with vaccine companies to create micro-chips (that’s “hydrogels” or “nanotech”!) that will send a “fluorescent signal” (that’s Luciferase!) detectable by an app on your smartphone? When did DARPA get involved in public health policy exactly? That strange question leads to other strange questions like: why did the Pentagon fund the Wuhan Lab of Virology to “study” weaponizing bat coronaviruses? Neither DARPA nor the Pentagon are well known for being leaders in health care, to say the very least. In fact, Big Pharma and Big Government have big plans for future vaccine shots that have “dissolvable needles” and quantum dot tattoos along with other amazing technology like embedding vaccine records beneath the skin of your children with invisible ink. According to one article: “Along with the vaccine, a child would be injected with a bit of dye that is invisible to the naked eye but easily seen with a special cell-phone filter, combined with an app that shines near-infrared light onto the skin.” That article was written in 2019: that’s just before the COVID crisis. That leads me to another thought: COVID-19 seems to be a very convenient “accidental lab leak” from China for introducing new technology. Under the cover of vaccinating people, we are really preparing to tag and track people. The once free nations of the West are testing a new authoritarian system of total control under the guise of public health. Just look at Australia or New Zealand or Canada or Italy to see how basic civil rights have been suspended indefinitely and a pseudo-medical tyranny has been installed. The Great Reset is being implemented with the lie that it’s all about “protecting your health.” Our military and intelligence agencies are not confronting China — they're copying China. A totalitarian nightmare is being imported into free countries through surveillance technologies. You don’t have to be a Christian to understand that such technology will be used to build a global surveillance state. The vaccine mandates have already led to vaccine passports. The vaccine passports are basically QR codes to track you by connecting to your smartphone. This will inevitably lead very soon to biometric ID embedded into your body. You won’t be able to enter restaurants or buy groceries or go to work without it. As the Bible says: no one will be able to buy or sell anything except those that have the mark. You will know the mark by its name, which is the name of the beast: the enemy of all mankind who, before he fell, was an angel of light named Lucifer. That’s why “Luciferase” should send a chill down your spine. So I sent out the following tweet to my followers (with a video showing the Luciferase patent information) earlier this week: This one tweet was sufficient, apparently, to get the word “Luciferase” trending on Twitter. (I didn’t notice at the time because I was busy covering the Glenn Youngkin victory on election night.) It was not until the next day that it became clear this one tweet had stirred up all the Big Pharma bots working remotely from Beijing. The largest producer of misinformation in America, The Washington Post, ran a piece on my tweet where I was branded a “COVID conspiracy theorist.” The Daily Beast ran a piece and then ran a second piece. Something called The Hill ran a piece. The forgotten boomer finance magazine Forbes got involved. Vanity Fair, the perfume ad magazine, did a little column on it. Then it became an international thing with The Independent and The Daily Mail chiming in. Now you have to ask yourself: are my tweets about vaccine ingredients really making headline news around the world? I checked with my husband first to see if I was indeed that famous. His response was disappointing. He told me: “At best, you’re semi-famous.” When corporate media outlets around the English-speaking world all start to scream in such coordinated fashion, you know you’ve hit a nerve. Why would they suddenly go crazy over the COVID vaccine ingredients? It’s because Big Journalism is being paid by Big Pharma to not disclose the truth. In fact, Big Pharma is paying Big Journalism to actively hide the truth around the world. Why do you think the COVID journalist Alex Berenson got kicked off Twitter? Why did the corporate media unleash a hate campaign against feminist icon Naomi Wolf? Why isn’t ex-Pfizer chief scientist Dr. Michael Yeadon allowed to speak? How is it possible that the inventor of mRNA vaccines himself, Dr. Robert Malone, is not a household name around the world? You know the answer: they have all warned us about the dangers of the new COVID vaccines. They have been silenced by Big Tech and Big Pharma because they have all dared to tell the truth. They are not alone. How many thousands have been banned or suspended already by Big Tech for questioning the COVID vaccines in our supposedly free nation? How many of your civil rights, your constitutional rights, can they trample before your very eyes? America is no longer a constitutional republic: it’s more like a corporate oligarchy where Big Pharma and Big Tech and Big Government tell you every day what you’re allowed to do on Zoom calls from the CDC with Dr. Fauci. They’re not even pretending anymore. This is something like Day 575 of “15 days to slow the spread.” Our so-called civil servants and elected officials are never going to give up their new “emergency powers” on their own. They mean to rule over us, and everybody knows it. That’s why the COVID-19 pandemic is being used to force everyone to get the new vaccines. That’s why natural immunity doesn’t count to anyone in the medical community. That’s why religious exemptions have disappeared at your work, along with medical exemptions. That’s why Ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine (and every other therapeutic drug) were swiftly outlawed. That’s why your 5 year old child will be “encouraged” and then coerced and then forced to take the jab, just as you were “encouraged” and then coerced and then forced to take the jab. That’s why the global vaccination campaign never stops when the already vaccinated start to get sick with COVID, or young boys suddenly die from heart inflammation, or world famous soccer players collapse on TV in the middle of games. That’s why health data (whether from Israel or Sweden or Florida or your local hospital) is totally irrelevant. The vaccine is being forced on everyone because the vaccine and the vaccine passport are the essential tools of a global surveillance system that will end everyone’s basic human freedom.",What is Luciferase?,false

Italian newspaper Il Tempo reports that the Institute has revised downward the number of people who have died from COVID rather than with COVID from 130,000 to under 4,000. “Yes, you read that right. Turns out 97.1% of deaths hitherto attributed to Covid were not due directly to Covid,” writes Toby Young. Of the of the 130,468 deaths registered as official COVID deaths since the start of the pandemic, only 3,783 are directly attributable to the virus alone. “All the other Italians who lost their lives had from between one and five pre-existing diseases. Of those aged over 67 who died, 7% had more than three co-morbidities, and 18% at least two,” writes Young. “According to the Institute, 65.8% of Italians who died after being infected with Covid were ill with arterial hypertension (high blood pressure), 23.5% had dementia, 29.3% had diabetes, and 24.8% atrial fibrillation. Add to that, 17.4% had lung problems, 16.3% had had cancer in the last five years and 15.7% suffered from previous heart failures.” The Institute’s new definition of a COVID death means that COVID has killed fewer people in Italy than (whisper it) the average bout of seasonal flu. If a similar change were made by other national governments, the official COVID death toll would be cut by a margin of greater than 90 per cent. Don’t expect many others to follow suit though, given that governments have invested so much of their authority in hyping the the threat posed by the virus. For example, behavioral psychologists in the UK worked with the state to deliberately “exaggerate” the threat of COVID via “unethical” and “totalitarian” methods of propaganda in order to terrify the public into mass compliance. And it worked. A survey conducted after the first lockdown found that the average Brit thought 100 times more people had died from COVID than the official death toll. Now we come to understand that the official killed ‘by COVID’ and not ‘with COVID’ figure is less than one tenth what is officially reported as the total COVID death toll. Despite the change, Italy may yet take the decision to make the COVID-19 vaccine mandatory, although how such a scheme would be imposed remains unspecified.",Italian Institute of Health Drastically Reduces Its Official COVID Death Toll Number,other

She passed away in the emergency room at New York-Presbyterian Lawrence Hospital after being brought in by paramedics. The cause of death has been listed as complications from the Pfizer vaccine. Myriam Bourla lived in the New York suburb of Scarsdale with her husband. Like many others, Bourla expressed skepticism with her husband’s experimental injection, originally refusing to take it. During an interview with Scarsdale 10583, Bourla stated that while she was “proud” of the work her husband did, she initially refused to take the vaccine, stating it was “not her turn, yet.” Albert Bourla has been having a bad week, claiming on Tuesday that people that spread misinformation on vaccines are “criminals.” Critics were quick to point out how Pfizer was previously fined $2.3 billion for illegal marketing in an off-label drug case. One person asked, “didn’t Pfizer pay the largest fine in Big Pharma history for bribing doctors?” In addition, Pfizer is being accused of lying to the public after a whistleblower raised questions around “data integrity and regulatory oversight” during Pfizer’s “vaccine” trials.There have been rumors that Pfizer’s CEO was arrested on the weekend.

557,227620220416994031062220964600288594138,"A funny thing happened this afternoon. Not funny as in “haha”. More like funny as in, “ohhhhh that’s how the FDA rigs the process.” I was reading the CDC’s “Guidance for Health Economics Studies Presented to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), 2019 Update” and I realized that the FDA’s woeful risk-benefit analysis in connection with Pfizer’s EUA application to jab children ages 5 to 11 violates many of the principles of the CDC’s Guidance document. The CDC “Guidance” document describes 21 things that every health economics study in connection with vaccines must do and the FDA risk-benefit analysis violated at least half of them. Today I want to focus on a single factor: the Number Needed to Vaccinate (NNTV). In four separate places the CDC Guidance document mentions the importance of coming up with a Number Needed to Vaccinate (NNTV). I did not recall seeing an NNTV in the FDA risk-benefit document. So I checked the FDA’s risk-benefit analysis again and sure enough, there was no mention of an NNTV. Because the FDA failed to provide an NNTV, I will attempt to provide it here. First a little background. The Number Needed to Treat (NNT) in order to prevent a single case, hospitalization, ICU admission, or death, is a standard way to measure the effectiveness of any drug. It’s an important tool because it enables policymakers to evaluate tradeoffs between a new drug, a different existing drug, or doing nothing. In vaccine research the equivalent term is Number Needed to Vaccinate (NNTV, sometimes also written as NNV) in order to prevent a single case, hospitalization, ICU admission, or death (those are 4 different NNTVs that one could calculate). Pharma HATES talking about NNTV and they hate talking about NNTV even more when it comes to COVID-19 vaccines because the NNTV is so ridiculously high that this vaccine could not pass any honest risk-benefit analysis. Indeed about a year ago I innocently asked on Twitter what the NNTV is for coronavirus vaccines. Pharma sent a swarm of trolls in to attack me and Pharma goons published hits pieces on me outside of Twitter to punish me for even asking the question. Of course none of the Pharma trolls provided an estimate of the NNTV for COVID-19 shots. That tells us that we are exactly over the target. Various health economists have calculated a NNTV for COVID-19 vaccines. Ronald Brown, a health economist in Canada, estimated that the NNTV to prevent a single case of coronavirus is from 88 to 142. Others have calculated the NNTV to prevent a single case at 256. German and Dutch researchers, using a large (500k) data set from a field study in Israel calculated an NNTV between 200 and 700 to prevent one case of COVID-19 for the mRNA shot marketed by Pfizer. They went further and figured out that the “NNTV to prevent one death is between 9,000 and 100,000 (95% confidence interval), with 16,000 as a point estimate.” You can see why Pharma hates this number so much (I can picture Pharma’s various PR firms sending out an “All hands on deck!” message right now to tell their trolls to attack this article). One would have to inject a lot of people to see any benefit and the more people who are injected the more the potential benefits are offset by the considerable side-effects from the shots. Furthermore, the NNTV to prevent a single case is not a very meaningful measure because most people, particularly children, recover on their own (or even more quickly with ivermectin if treated early). The numbers that health policy makers should really want to know are the NNTV to prevent a single hospitalization, ICU admission, or death. But with the NNTV to prevent a single case already so high, and with significant adverse events from coronavirus vaccines averaging about 15% nationwide, Pharma and the FDA dare not calculate an NNTV for hospitalizations, ICU, and deaths, because then no one would ever take this product (bye bye $93 billion in annual revenue). Increased all cause mortality in the Pfizer clinical trial of adults As Bobby Kennedy explains, Pfizer’s clinical trial in adults showed alarming increases in all cause mortality in the vaccinated: In Pfizer’s 6 month clinical trial in adults — there was 1 covid death out of 22,000 in the vaccine (“treatment”) group and 2 Covid deaths out of 22,000 in the placebo group (see Table s4). So NNTV = 22,000. The catch is there were 5 heart attack deaths in the vaccine group and only 1 in placebo group. So for every 1 life saved from Covid, the Pfizer vaccine kills 4 from heart attacks. All cause mortality in the 6 month study was 20 in vaccine group and 14 in placebo group. So a 42% all cause mortality increase among the vaccinated. The vaccine loses practically all efficacy after 6 months so they had to curtail the study. They unblinded and offered the vaccine to the placebo group. At that point the rising harm line had long ago intersected the sinking efficacy line. Former NY Times investigative reporter Alex Berenson also wrote about the bad outcomes for the vaccinated in the Pfizer clinical trial in adults (here). Berenson received a lifetime ban from Twitter for posting Pfizer’s own clinical trial data. Pfizer learned their lesson with the adult trial and so when they conducted a trial of their mRNA vaccine in children ages 5 to 11 they intentionally made it too small (only 2,300 participants) and too short (only followed up for 2 months) in order to hide harms. Estimating an NNTV in children ages 5 to 11 using Pfizer’s own clinical trial data All of the NNTV estimates above are based on data from adults. In kids the NNTV will be even higher (the lower the risk, the higher the NNTV to prevent a single bad outcome). Children ages 5 to 11 are at extremely low risk of death from coronavirus. In a meta-analysis combining data from 5 studies, Stanford researchers Cathrine Axfors and John Ioannidis found a median infection fatality rate (IFR) of 0.0027% in children ages 0-19. In children ages 5 to 11 the IFR is even lower. Depending on the study one looks at, COVID-19 is slightly less dangerous or roughly equivalent to the flu in children. So how many children would need to be injected with Pharma’s mRNA shot in order to prevent a single hospitalization, ICU admission, or death? Let’s examine Pfizer’s EUA application and the FDA’s risk-benefit analysis. By Pfizer’s own admission, there were zero hospitalization, ICU admissions, or deaths, in the treatment or control group in their study of 2,300 children ages 5 to 11. So the Number Needed to Vaccinate in order to prevent a single hospitalization, ICU admission, or death, according to Pfizer’s own data, is infinity. ∞. Not the good kind of infinity as in God or love or time or the universe. This is the bad kind of infinity as in you could vaccinate every child age 5 to 11 in the U.S. and not prevent a single hospitalization, ICU admission, or death from coronavirus according to Pfizer’s own clinical trial data as submitted to the FDA. Of course Pfizer likes this kind of infinity because it means infinite profits. [Technically speaking the result is “undefined” because mathematically one cannot divide by zero, but you get my point.] Estimating an NNTV and risk-benefit model in children ages 5 to 11 using the limited data that are available Everyone knows that Pfizer was not even trying to conduct a responsible clinical trial of their mRNA shot in kids ages 5 to 11. Pfizer could have submitted to the FDA a paper napkin with the words “Iz Gud!” written in crayon and the VRBPAC would have approved the shot. They are all in the cartel together and they are all looking forward to their massive payoff/payday. But let’s not be like Pharma. Instead, let’s attempt to come up with a best guess estimate based on real world data. Over time, others will develop a much more sophisticated estimate (for example, Walach, Klement, & Aukema, 2021 estimated an NNTV for 3 different populations based on “days post dose”). But for our purposes here I think there is a much easier way to come up with a ballpark NNTV estimate for children ages 5 to 11. Here’s the benefits model: As of October 30, 2021, the CDC stated that 170 children ages 5 to 11 have died of COVID-19-related illness since the start of the pandemic. (That represents less than 0.1% of all coronavirus-related deaths nationwide even though children that age make up 8.7% of the U.S. population). The Pfizer mRNA shot only “works” for about 6 months (it increases risk in the first month, provides moderate protection in months 2 through 4 and then effectiveness begins to wane, which is why all of the FDA modeling only used a 6 month time-frame). So any modeling would have to be based on vaccine effectiveness in connection with the 57 (170/3) children who might otherwise have died of COVID-related illness during a 6-month period. At best, the Pfizer mRNA shot might be 80% effective against hospitalizations and death. That number comes directly from the FDA modeling (p. 32). I am bending over backwards to give Pfizer the benefit of considerable doubt because again, the Pfizer clinical trial showed NO reduction in hospitalizations or death in this age group. So injecting all 28,384,878 children ages 5 to 11 with two doses of Pfizer (which is what the Biden administration wants to do) would save, at most, 45 lives (0.8 effectiveness x 57 fatalities that otherwise would have occurred during that time period = 45). So then the NNTV to prevent a single fatality in this age group is 630,775 (28,384,878 / 45). But it’s a two dose regimen so if one wants to calculate the NNTV per injection the number doubles to 1,261,550. It’s literally the worst NNTV in the history of vaccination. If you inject that many children, you certainly will have lots and lots of serious side effects including disability and death. So let’s look at the risk side of the equation. Here’s the risk model: Because the Pfizer clinical trial has no useable data, I have to immuno-bridge from the nearest age group. 31,761,099 people (so just about 10% more people than in the 5 to 11 age bracket) ages 12 to 24 have gotten at least one coronavirus shot. The COVID-19 vaccine program has only existed for 10 months and younger people have only had access more recently (children 12 to 15 have had access for five months; since May 10) — so we’re looking at roughly the same observational time period as modeled above. During that time, there are 128 reports of fatal side effects following coronavirus mRNA injections in people 12 to 24. (That’s through October 22, 2021. There is a reporting lag though so the actual number of reports that have been filed is surely higher). Kirsch, Rose, and Crawford (2021) estimate that VAERS undercounts fatal reactions by a factor of 41 which would put the total fatal side effects in this age-range at 5,248. (Kirsch et al. represents a conservative estimate because others have put the underreporting factor at 100.) With potentially deadly side effects including myo- and pericarditis disproportionately impacting youth it is reasonable to think that over time the rate of fatal side effects from mRNA shots in children ages 5 to 11 might be similar to those in ages 12 to 24. So, to put it simply, the Biden administration plan would kill 5,248 children via Pfizer mRNA shots in order to save 45 children from dying of coronavirus. For every one child saved by the shot, another 117 would be killed by the shot. The Pfizer mRNA shot fails any honest risk-benefit analysis in children ages 5 to 11. Even under the best circumstances, estimating NNTV and modeling risk vs. benefits is fraught. In the current situation, with a new and novel bioengineered virus, where Pfizer’s data are intentionally underpowered to hide harms, and the FDA, CDC, & Biden Administration are doing everything in their power to push dangerous drugs on kids, making good policy decisions is even more difficult. If the FDA or CDC want to calculate a different NNTV (and explain how they arrived at that number) I’m all ears. But we all know that the FDA refused to calculate an NNTV not because they forgot, but because they knew the number was so high that it would destroy the case for mRNA vaccines in children this age. Your move CDC — your own Guidance document states that you must provide this number. Update: CDC finally mentions NNTV, but . . . Toward the end of the six-hour CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) Nov. 2 meeting where the committee voted to recommend Pfizer’s EUA vaccine for children 5 - 11, there was finally a mention of NNTV. It was on slide 36 of a presentation by CDC official D.r Sara Oliver. Unfortunately the CDC estimate was untethered from reality. I’ll explain: Oliver claimed the NNTV to prevent a single case is 10, even though the best lower bound estimate is 88 and other estimates are 200 or higher (see calculations here and here). Then she claimed the NNTV to prevent a single hospitalization is between 2,213 and 8,187. This is dishonest and a violation of scientific norms. NNTV is calculated by dividing 1 by the Absolute Risk Reduction. There was no Absolute Risk Reduction in hospitalizations in the Pfizer clinical trial in kids 5 to 11, because no one was hospitalized in either the treatment or control group. 1/0 is “undefined” not 8,187. Oliver made no estimate of NNTV to prevent a single COVID-19-related death because that is also undefined (again, there were no COVID-related deaths in the treatment or placebo group in the trial so the absolute risk reduction was zero). Oliver also did not model injuries or deaths from the vaccine (she immuno-bridged from an older age group to show benefits but ignored the reported harms from the vaccine in the older age group). I should also note that my estimates of NNTV were based on CDC data showing 170 deaths from COVID-19-related illness in kids ages 5 to 11 over the last 18 months (I got the number directly from the CDC COVID tracking website). However at the ACIP meeting, the CDC said the number of children in this age group who have died of COVID-19-related illness is 94. If 94 is the correct number to use, then the NNTV to prevent a single death from COVID-19 related illness in this age group would be 28,384,878 / 31 = 915,641. But it’s a two-dose regimen, so if one wants to calculate the NNTV-per-injection the number doubles to 1,831,282. I imagine that at most, half of American parents will be foolish enough to inject this toxic product into their kids. At a 50% uptake rate, the ACIP decision to approve the Pfizer shot will likely kill 2,624 children via adverse reactions in order to potentially save 12 from COVID-19-related illness. Now you know why the CDC did not release the meeting materials prior to the ACIP meeting — they could not stand up to any public scrutiny.",What is the Number Needed to Vaccinate (NNTV) to prevent a single COVID-19 fatality in kids 5 to 11 based on the Pfizer EUA application?,other
558,271167828579370701053625537035924976918,"Those creepy vials full of mystery chemicals that they are calling “vaccines” for the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) have been found to destroy the body’s ability to protect the integrity of DNA, which over time can cause cancer. A new study published in the open-access journal Viruses looked at the effects of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins – these are found in (Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca) or created by (Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna) Fauci Flu shots – on the human body. What was discovered might send shivers down your spine. In essence, Chinese Virus injection spike proteins inhibit natural DNA damage repair, which is an essential component of the body’s adaptive immune response. Jab spike proteins localize themselves in the nucleus of cells and block key DNA repair proteins such as BRCA1 and 53BP1 from doing their job. The last sentence of the study’s abstract sums up the discovery as such: “Our findings reveal a potential molecular mechanism by which the spike protein might impede adaptive immunity and underscore the potential side effects of full-length spike-based vaccines.” Covid jab spike proteins cause immunodeficiency Once injected into the body, the study further explains, spike proteins “hijack and dysregulate the host cellular machinery to replicate, assemble, and spread progeny viruses.” In a worst-case scenario, the result is a drastic decline in T cells, helper T cells and suppressor T cells, all of which are needed to fight off malignant cells that, if left unchecked, can cause tumors to develop. “As two critical host surveillance systems, the immune and DNA repair systems are the primary systems that higher organisms rely on for defense against diverse threats and tissue homeostasis,” the study reads. “Emerging evidence indicates that these two systems are interdependent, especially during lymphocyte development and maturation.” As certain key functions of DNA repair degrade due to said spike proteins, both T and B cells take a huge hit, leading to immunodeficiency. This means that injecting spike proteins into the body damages the immune system – it does not help the immune system like some “health authorities” are claiming. “If DNA damage cannot be properly repaired, it will contribute to the amplification of viral infection-induced pathology,” the study further warns. Jab spike proteins seem to have been designed to destroy the immune system The fact that covid “vaccine” spike proteins accumulate in cell nuclei is particularly problematic because this is where the most critical aspects of DNA repair take place. In order to ensure genome stability, all of the necessary components for DNA repair and maintenance must converge in the nuclei as designed. This cannot happen, however, when spike proteins get in the way. “NHEJ repair and homologous recombination (HR) repair are two major DNA repair pathways that not only continuously monitor and ensure genome integrity but are also vital for adaptive immune cell functions,” the study explains about one such DNA repair component that is negatively impacted by the presence of spike proteins. It was observed that spike proteins cause certain DNA repair proteins to either over- or under-express themselves, which in turn diminishes the efficiency of NHEJ and other DNA repair components from activating as they should. There are many additional details to the study that you can investigate for yourself if you wish to dive deeper into the methodologies behind the research. It is quite the eye-opener and something that deserves much more attention than it is currently getting. Full-length spike proteins found in jabs inflict serious immune damage One thing that must be emphasized is the fact that the type of spike protein observed to cause the most damage is the full-length kind, which just so happens to be the type used in both the adenovirus and mRNA injections. For many months prior to the unleashing of the “Operation Warp Speed” jabs back in 2020, we were told the spike proteins found in the jabs were “safe” and would not cause the same type of damage supposedly caused by “covid” itself. It now appears that this was all a lie. While there supposedly do exist what are known as RBD-based “vaccines” that do not contain full-length spike proteins, these are not currently in use in the United States. The jabs that everyone is receiving contain the really deadly stuff, and this will become increasingly apparent over time as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) progressively kicks in. Since the jab rollout is occurring in waves with some lots and batches seemingly causing more damage than others, the truth about what is taking place on a larger scale is still somewhat veiled. There are not yet people dropping dead in the streets all over the place, so to the average person it is not fully evident that a mass culling is taking place. Once the long-term effects of this immune system degradation fully kick in, however, things could get really ugly really quickly. “If you were bent on decimating a population and were going to do it by lethal injection, you would definitely not want to kill off a bunch right away to raise alarm that the stuff is poison,” wrote one Natural News commenter. “This way you can still run with the lie that the jab is safe … just not for some.” Another responded in kind, agreeing that those perpetrating all this “would want death to be slow but assured.” “These ‘vaccines’ are the perfect cover as it takes time for most to produce enough spike proteins to die from it, and the deaths appear to be from a variety of causes.”","Covid “vaccine” spike proteins destroy DNA repair pathways, paving the way for CANCER to grow and spread",false
559,144644167692687688515446892522663734666,"Losing a new born is a heart breaking endeavour, as is the pain of losing an unborn child. Which is why we’re both saddened and shocked to bring you the latest update on the number of unborn and newborn children to lose their lives as a result of the mothers receiving one of the Covid-19 vaccines in the United Kingdom. The Government have released weekly reports on adverse reactions to the experimental Covid-19 vaccines, the first of which covered data inputted to the MHRA Yellow Card Scheme from the 9th December 2020 through to the 24th January 2021. Their latest report (find it here), which is the seventh to be released covers data inputted to the MHRA Yellow Card Scheme from the 9th December 2020 though to the 7th March 2021. Just six weeks separate the first and seventh report, and the shocking increase in the number of women losing their unborn and newborn child in that time due to having either the Pfizer or AstraZeneca Covid vaccine is appalling. This was the Governments own advice upon emergency approval of the Pfizer / BioNTech vaccine –Pregnancy’ There are no or limited amount of data from the use of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2. Animal reproductive toxicity studies have not been completed. COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 is not recommended during pregnancy. For women of childbearing age, pregnancy should be excluded before vaccination. In addition, women of childbearing age should be advised to avoid pregnancy for at least 2 months after their second dose. We told you about this back in December, as the Governments own advice also included comments on breast-feeding and fertility which were as follows – Breast-feeding It is unknown whether COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 is excreted in human milk. A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 should not be used during breast-feeding. Fertility It is unknown whether COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 has an impact on fertility.’ It is because of this advice released by the UK Government that we were so shocked to see in the first released report of adverse reactions to the Covid vaccines, using data inputted to the MHRA Yellow Card Scheme up to the 24th January 2021 a total of 4 women had suffered a miscarriage as a result of having the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. As well as a total of 2 women losing their unborn child as result of having the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine.We’re still unable to answer why these women were given one of the Covid vaccines against the Governments own advice. But what’s truly shocking is how much this number has increased in the 6 weeks that have unfolded since.
According to the seventh report released by the UK Government on adverse reactions to the Covid vaccines, using data inputted to the MHRA Yellow Card Scheme up to the 7th March 2021, there has been a 475% increase since the 24th January in the number of women who have lost their unborn child after having the Pfizer vaccine, bringing the total to 23. This is devastating.
Sadly there is also now 1 report of a premature baby sadly dying after the mother had the Pfizer vaccine.The AstraZeneca jab has also caused unnecessary pain to expectant mothers. As of the 7th March there has been a 150% increase since the 24th January in the number of women to suffer a miscarriage, bringing the total to 5. Tragically there has also been 1 still birth reported to the MHRA Yellow Card Scheme after the mother had the AstraZeneca vaccine, but shockingly this has not been labelled as a fatality. The question is why are we seeing these numbers when the Governments own advice was that pregnant women should not have the vaccine?
Well we started digging and found that the Government has since updated it’s original advice to the following –
4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
There is limited experience with use of the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 in pregnant women.
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy,
embryo/foetal development, parturition or post-natal development. Administration of
the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 in pregnancy should only be considered when the potential
benefits outweigh any potential risks for the mother and foetus.
This is criminal! We dread to think what sort of numbers of these events we will see in the weeks to come.

560,148545255890980277343142579506850954605,"It’s been rumored that Gavin Newsom is out of sight since getting his booster on Oct 27 because he developed Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) or Bell’s Palsy. This can happen within hours after getting his booster so this make perfect sense.This also explains why nobody has seen him in public since then; anyone who saw him would instantly know. I checked into this and I’m over 90% sure that this is true (but I can’t tell you publicly about it without revealing my source) which prompted me to write this article. Am I 100% certain? No. This is just my personal educated hypothesis piecing together the information (both from public and private sources) that I’ve gathered. What’s your best guess? This Fox News article says: “Newsom press secretary Daniel Lopez said the governor worked at the state Capitol last week and would begin making normal appearances again sometime this week, according to a statement provided to SFGATE.” Really?!?! “Sometime this week???” And no explanation for why he’s dropped out of sight for 2 weeks and cancelled his appearance at the UN Climate Summit on Nov 1-3? This seems really suspicious to me. On the other hand, this article claims he’ll appear tomorrow (November 9). And another article doesn’t even speculate as to when he’ll be back. Look, it can’t be a family emergency… Why not do a quick video on Twitter saying that he’s fine and dispel the rumors? He’s completely off the grid. Alex Jones did some digging and found a story that is consistent with a vaccine injury: Newsom is isolated in his home with doctors going in and out. So we’ll soon see who got it right. How I arrived at my hypothesis Here’s the background for my hypothesis: Twitter reports of facial paralysis (my first thought was Bell’s Palsy). Emails with my friends say it is GBS (either can cause facial paralysis). I had a “soft” confirmation from a friend who absolutely knows him. The friend acted in a way consistent with the hypothesis that he has GBS or Bell’s Palsy. I’ve heard from two lawyers, both of whom told me he has GBS. One lawyer talked to two different very close friends of Gavin and got the exact same story: GBS. There is an article about it on the CHD website (archived here) Confirmation in multiple checks done by Alex Jones. Albert Benavides (aka WelcomeTheEagle88) recently did a VAERS analysis for me looking at symptoms which are elevated by the vaccine versus a 5-year baseline rate (VAERS reports from 2015-2019). Look at what popped up on #11 (the 11th highest elevated adverse event). You are 1,533 times more likely to get Bell’s Palsy after the COVID vaccines than any other vaccine. NOTE: This screen shot is the “tip of the iceberg” as far as serious adverse events caused by the COVID vaccines. The full list is over 5,000 elevated adverse events and I’ll be writing about this later today on substack (subscribe to be notified). Guillain-Barre after these vaccines is less likely than Bell’s Palsy by a factor of 4.5, so I’m guessing it is more likely Bell’s Palsy (but it very well could be GBS). Did the vaccine cause Bell’s Palsy (or GBS) for Newsom? He was perfectly fine before the shot and within hours after the shot he’s paralyzed. Could be bad luck. But come on. Why doesn’t he just admit the truth, that he got Bell’s Palsy (or GBS) from the vaccine? Well truth telling is not how it is done in politics. The reason he won’t tell the truth it: It would create vaccine hesitancy because it would be an admission that the vaccines aren’t safe like he claims It would make him look silly for mandating very dangerous vaccines in California. He doesn’t want to make the CDC look incompetent for never spotting the safety signal. Newsom is still mandating that your kids get the vaccine. He’s even tweeting about it after being injured! You can’t make this stuff up. Check out the tweet and the date. He’s acting like nothing happened to him: Hundreds of previously healthy kids will suffer neurological damage just like he did as a result of his mandate. Hundreds of kids will die from the vaccine. Bell’s and GBS are just two of over 5,000 adverse events that are elevated by these vaccine. More troubling is that the risk-benefit analysis for 5 to 11 I’ve seen shows we will kill 117 kids to maybe save 1 kid from COVID. Governor Newsom and the CDC don’t seem to care about that; there’s not even a CDC category for vaccine deaths. Over 120,000 Americans have suffered from Bell’s Palsy after vaccination (you take the incidence rate from the table and multiply by the minimum VAERS underreporting factor (URF) of 41 which is calculated here) and it could easily be over 250,000 cases. A neurologist I know has over 2,000 clients with vaccine injuries (out of 20,000 client base). The neurologist never had any events before now in his/her practice caused by the vaccine. This shows you it is the vaccine causing the events, not “over reporting” as is claimed by the FDA. When will it end? I hope soon. But nobody in America likes to admit they were wrong. Even after they’ve been injured. Joel Kallman, the creator of the V-safe application, died shortly after he was vaccinated. He never got a chance to tell people what he thought of the safety of the vaccine. Let’s hope that Newsom gets the chance to learn from this and change his thinking. P.S. If you think you know whether it is GBS or Bell’s Palsy, please comment below.",Gavin Newsom is out of sight likely because he has Guillain-Barre syndrome from his booster shot,false

They used so-called ""vaccines"" when Japan has just proven, in less than ONE MONTH, that Ivermectin can wipe out the disease. Sweden's Public Health Agency on Wednesday recommended a temporary halt to the use of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine among young adults, citing concerns over rare side effects to the heart. It said the pause should initially be in force until December 1, explaining that it had received evidence of an increased risk of side effects such as inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis) and inflammation of the pericardium (pericarditis). {link to CBS News (Secure)] Finland, Denmark and Norway have also moved away from the COVID vaccines. Finland last Thursday joined Sweden, Denmark and Norway in recommending against use of Moderna Inc.’s Covid-19 vaccine in younger age groups, citing risks of rare cardiovascular side effects they said warranted the precautionary steps. Finland’s Institute for Health and Welfare said last Thursday it would pause use of the Moderna vaccine among men under the age of 30, following a similar step last Wednesday by Swedish regulators. Denmark last Wednesday said it wouldn’t offer the Moderna vaccine to under-18s as a precautionary measure. Norway on Wednesday advised that all under-18s shouldn’t be given the Moderna vaccine, even if they had already received one dose, and recommended that men under 30 consider getting the vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech instead. Norwegian officials cited U.S., Canadian and Nordic data, saying the absolute risks remain low and calling the advice “a precautionary measure.” The European Medicines Agency said Thursday that new preliminary data from the Nordic countries supports a warning the agency adopted in July that inflammatory heart conditions called myocarditis and pericarditis can occur in very rare cases following vaccination with Covid-19 shots made by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech.

Just so you understand the timeline. By September deaths from the COVID-19 Vaccine jabs were being investigated. At roughly that time, the vials were under scrutiny and metal ""magnetic"" material was found in them. Very shortly thereafter, the Japanese minister of health announced doctors could prescribe Ivermectin. A month later, the Western press is shocked that COVID has all but disappeared from the island. Get it? Understand? This is what it looks like in a country that still has rule of law. The governemnt responds to reports of death and contaminated vaxes, moves to real treatment, people get better, and the virus disappears. Now compare that to what is happening in the United States and in Australia and New Zealand.  All three countries are in dismal failure in their handling of COVID-19, and that failure has resulted in staggering loss of freedom and destruction of commerce. This is the biggest news story right now. Japan has ended COVID. It did it after it stopped the vax rollout and went to Ivermectin. Period. Hard stop. Hal Turner Editorial Opinion If your government really wanted to end COVID, if that was its true goal, it would do what Japan did. You can use Japan as a case study any time someone starts yammering some crap about how the vax is about helping you help yourself from getting others sick with what they've been vaxed against.

So if your government won't do what Japan did, now that JAPAN HAS BEAT COVID, what does it say about your government? It says the conspiracy theorists were right! They were right. It is a damning conviction of the narrative that the government is somehow a benevolent force against you getting viruses. No, because we now have historic precedent of a government doing the right thing and getting the WIN. If your government won't do it, it is because the vax is about something other than the public good. Hmmmm. What could it be about? How about totalitarian control!

562,125838758628283677678081390959144195769,"Are you aware that Australia is currently in the grip of dictatorial tyranny due to a handful of Covid-19 deaths occurring every day? What’s happening in that country has absolutely nothing to do with a virus, and everything to do with control, and you only need to look at what’s going on in the United Kingdom to confirm that. Because the latest Public Health data shows that Covid-19 vaccinated people have accounted for 81% of Covid-19 deaths this summer, whilst UK Government data shows that Covid-19 deaths are over 11 times higher than this time last year, and Office for National Statistics data shows that since teens were first given the Covid-19 vaccine there has been a 63% increase in deaths among teen boys compared to the same period in 2020. The UK is essentially in the midst of a national disaster with a vaccine programme that has clearly failed, but more worryingly has also killed children, and will kill more. because we seem to have a problem in the UK where a huge majority of the population do not believe a single thing unless it is shown on the BBC News. But the data could not be more clear. Just take a look at Public Health Scotland’s latest Covid-19 Statistical report published September 29th. Table 18 of the report shows that the vast majority of Covid-19 deaths between August 21st and September 17th 2021 were among the fully vaccinated population with 233 deaths recorded, accounting for 77% of all Covid-19 deaths. Throw in the 10 deaths to have occurred among the partly vaccinated and that means the vaccinated population accounted for 81% of Covid-19 deaths in Scotland between August 21st and September 17th. UK Health Security Agency (the sinister replacement for Public Health England) data doesn’t look much better either. Table 4 of the report published by UKHSA shows that there were 687 deaths among the unvaccinated, 110 deaths among the partly vaccinated, but a frightening 2,338 deaths among the fully vaccinated between August 30th and September 26th 2021.This means that the unvaccinated account for just 22% of Covid-19 deaths during September 2021, whilst the vaccinated account for a disastrous 78%. And don’t even attempt to argue that this is normal because the majority of the adult population have allegedly been vaccinated. If this were normal then how do you explain the fact that Covid-19 deaths are over twelve times higher than the same period last year when there wasn’t a Covid-19 vaccine available? With only a claimed 95% effectiveness (The latest UKHSA data actually shows the vaccines have a negative efficacy as low as MINUS 66 percent), you would of course expect to still see some Covid-19 deaths. But not when seasonality should be on our side, just like it was in 2020 when deaths dropped to nearly zero. Mix seasonality in with an effective vaccine and you would have thought the UK would have just enjoyed a Covid-19 free summer, but the reality has been far from it.","The UK has Fallen – 81% of Covid-19 deaths are among the Vaccinated, Male Teen Deaths have rised by 63% since they were offered the jab, Covid-19 Deaths are 12 times higher than this time last year",false

Daily death growth rates from the virus decreased by 0.7 percent within the first 20 days of the mandates and 1.9 percent in 81-100 days. “Daily case and death growth rates before implementation of mask mandates were not statistically different from the reference period,” the CDC study states.

(Official White House photo by Tia Dufour) UPDATED Feb. 8, 2021: A fact check by USA Today from March and April 2020 indicated the coronavirus is not man-made or engineered, but its origin remains unclear. It said, ""There is no evidence to suggest that the virus was created in a Chinese laboratory. ""It is probable, likely, that the virus is of animal origin,"" WHO spokeswoman Fadela Chaib said. The Scripps Research Institute released a study that rejects the notion that the virus was man-made. Researchers concluded that if the virus were engineered, its genome sequence would more closely resemble earlier and more serious versions of the coronavirus. Advertisement - story continues below FactCheck.org stated on Feb. 7, 2020, ""There is no evidence that the new virus was bioengineered, and every indication it came from an animal. ... All lines of evidence point to the virus coming from an animal. That's consistent with what scientists have learned about the ecology of coronaviruses in the last 20 years,"" according to Timothy Sheahan, a virologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. It fits with the fact that the virus shares 96% of its genome with a bat virus. ""The genetic data is pointing to this virus coming from a bat reservoir,"" he said, ""not a lab."" TRENDING: Question of election fraud will not go away ORIGINAL STORY: China, the World Health Organization and the U.S. National Institutes of Health have dimissed the theory that the virus causing the global pandemic that has killed more than 2 million people and devastated economies worldwide escaped from the Wuhan, China, lab funded by the United States. Advertisement - story continues below But there's no disputing the fact, as Newsweek reported in April 2020, that NIH executive Dr. Anthony Fauci promoted a highly controversial type of research involving the manipulation of viruses to explore their potential for infecting humans. And it's known that more than 200 scientists pressured the Obama administration in 2014 to temporarily halt U.S. funding for that research because of the risk of a manipulated virus accidentally escaping a lab and igniting a pandemic. Nevertheless, under Fauci's direction, the dangerous virus engineering resumed in 2017 and continued until April 2020. Now, documentary evidence makes it a ""near certainty"" that the coronavirus pandemic originated in the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China, where so-called ""gain-of-function"" research was funded by Fauci's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, according to Steve Hilton, who is leading a special investigation for his Fox News show ""The Next Revolution.""

Significantly, his investigation found a direct link between a bat coronavirus discovered a decade ago in a mine in Yunnan province and one that had been engineered in the Wuhan lab, 1,000 miles away. Hilton noted on his show Sunday night that scientists at the Wuhan lab published a paper in February 2020 stating they had recently discovered a virus in Yunnan province that ""showed high sequence identity"" to COVID-19. However, Hilton discovered after running the virus's genome sequence through the NIH's GenBank database that only one virus was an exact match to COVID-19. It wasn't the virus discovered recently. It was the once discovered a decade ago in Yunnan province that killed miners who had stirred up bat feces. Advertisement - story continues below Hilton found it curious that the Wuhan researchers not only didn't reveal that fact, they changed the name of the Yunnan virus, as indicated by GenBank. As evidence that the Yunnan virus was manipulated in the Wuhan lab, Hilton pointed out that the two viruses are the same, except for two key elements: The COVID-19 virus is more infectious and can enter human cells in the respiratory system. ""Those are the exact places in the viral sequence where gain-of-function techniques would be applied, if ... you were funded by the NAID to research bat coronaviruses to explore emergences or spillover potential,"" he said. ""Spillover potential"" refers to the ability of a virus to jump from animals to humans. That exact gain-of-function research, he pointed out, was touted in a Nov. 30, 2017, progress report tied to an NAID grant. The crucial question, Hilton said, was whether the virus at the center of that U.S.-funded work was the one that was discovered in the mine a decade ago. ""The match between that virus and the work commissioned by NAID is so perfect, it's impossible to believe they weren't,"" he said. He noted that workers in the Wuhan lab were the first identified cases of COVID-19 in the fall of 2019. Implausible coincidences
The WHO and others are leaning toward a ""natural"" explanation for the pandemic, Hilton noted. But if the COVID-19 pandemic originated naturally in the Yunnan mine – as the genome sequence indicates – but had nothing to do with research at the Wuhan lab, you would ""have to believe in a laughably implausible set of coincidences."" The bats in Yunnan province would have had to infect each other and another unknown animal or a human and then travel 1,000 miles – without infecting anyone else – until they got to Wuhan.
Before any mutations, he argued, the virus was 10 to 20 times more infectious than any previously observed virus occuring in nature.
""And most incredibly of all,"" he added, ""the infected animal or human would have somehow chosen to make that 1,000-mile trek to the only place in all of China that had been working for years on the virus it was already infected with,"" the Wuhan lab. Significantly, the Chinese regime has blocked access to the Wuhan lab. Last week, NBC News reported that a Wuhan Institute of Virology database with 20,000 entries was removed last spring for ""security reasons."" But Hilton said the U.S. government also has not been forthcoming. After two weeks, the NIH finally responded last Friday to his request for comment on the coronavirus gain-of-function research project that began after the Obama administration's halt in funding. The NIH replied that the project did not involve gain-of-function research. But Hilton noted that the project to which NIH referred was not the project he was asking about, which clearly was gain-of-function research. Calling the response ""deceptive,"" he wanted to know whether or not the director of NIH, the famed scientist Francis Collins, was aware of the statement.The Chinese regime can certainly be blamed for a cover-up allowing the outbreak to become a global pandemic, Hilton said. But the reason the virus exists and is so contagious, he asserted, can be traced back to the decision of Collins and Fauci to go ahead with the gain-of-function research as a ""risk worth taking"" after the Obama administration stopped the funding. ""Of course Dr. Collins or Dr. Fauci didn't create the pandemic on purpose. That is obviously ludicrous. They've dedicated their careers to fighting disease,"" Hilton said. ""But there's little doubt that one of their weapons of choice in that fight did lead to this pandemic."" And they were warned that it could happen. Finding the Achilles' heel A Newsweek report in April 2020 confirmed that NAID funded scientists at the Wuhan Institute of Virology and other institutions for work on gain-of-function research on bat coronaviruses. In 2011, Fauci played an important role in promoting the work, arguing the research was worth the risk, because it could enable scientists to prepare treatments and vaccines in advance if a pandemic occurred, Newsweek said. Fauci and two co-authors defended the work in the Washington Post in December 2011, arguing that ""determining the molecular Achilles' heel of these viruses can allow scientists to identify novel antiviral drug targets that could be used to prevent infection in those at risk or to better treat those who become infected."" The work was halted by the Obama administration in 2014 under pressure from scientists but resumed in December 2017 when the NIH lifted the moratorium. Going forward, scientists had to get approval from a panel of experts who would determine whether or not the risks were justified. Advertisement - story continues below The research was conducted in secret until, in early 2019, a reporter for Science magazine discovered that the NIH had approved two gain-of-function projects, drawing rebuke from scientists in an editorial in the Washington Post. ""We have serious doubts about whether these experiments should be conducted at all,"" wrote Tom Inglesby of Johns Hopkins University and Marc Lipsitch of Harvard. ""[W]ith deliberations kept behind closed doors, none of us will have the opportunity to understand how the government arrived at these decisions or to judge the rigor and integrity of that process."" In April 2020, a U.S. government report concluded the Wuhan lab was the ""most likely"" source of COVID-19, finding other explanations ""highly unlikely."" The report noted the activities of Shi Zhengli, a leader in bat coronavirus research at the Wuhan lab. A 2015 academic report in Nature Medicine by Shi and 14 other scientists said that while researching the potential for bat coronaviruses to infect humans, ""we built a chimeric virus encoding a novel, zoonotic (animal-origin) spike protein ... that was isolated from Chinese horseshoe bats."" The U.S. government analysis, reported by the Washington Times, found virus-carrying animals had been ""sold as pets, dead laboratory animals were not properly disposed of, and lab workers were known to boil and eat laboratory-used eggs."" The report noted that China was clamping down on efforts to investigate whether the virus came from a lab, issuing a ""gag order"" and putting a military microbiologist in charge of the Wuhan lab.

567,258294010895719042557948678144972655244,"Records suggest more than 100 batches of absentee ballots in Fulton County could be missing. Some experts see ""election tabulation malpractice"" as state officials seek to remove county's top election supervisors.Documents that Georgia's largest county submitted to state officials as part of a post-election audit highlight significant irregularities in the Atlanta area during last November's voting, ranging from identical vote tallies repeated multiple times to large batches of absentee ballots that appear to be missing from the official ballot-scanning records. The problems in predominantly Democratic Fulton County potentially impact thousands of ballots in a presidential race that Joe Biden was certified as winning statewide by fewer than 12,000 votes. The memos reviewed by Just the News include the handwritten tally sheets for all absentee ballots counted by the county as well as a private report from a contractor hired by Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to monitor the Atlanta-area election process. The report, which chronicled seven days of problems, recorded troubling behavior like the mysterious removal of a suitcase of sensitive election data known as polls pads, used to authenticate voters. ""Learn that Rick reprogramming poll pads earlier was setting up a new precinct for SC11 because someone took the wrong suitcase but only took one,"" the contractor Seven Hills Strategy wrote late on Nov. 2, the night before Election Day. ""Seems to be a mystery who this person was --> Should have chain of custody paperwork!! That means that a stranger just walked out with sensitive election materials?"" The contractor also observed that sensitive election materials were left on a dock at a warehouse without supervision. ""Several cases (including SC11) were just left out on the loading dock outside the warehouse,"" he wrote. ""Thankfully the seals were intact."" File  SOS7HillStrategyFultonCountyNotes.pdf The revelations come as a state judge has taken the extraordinary step of ordering absentee ballots in the county unsealed so that a private audit led by lawyer Bob Cheeley can examine the actual papers and resolve discrepancies. Cheeley told Just the News on Wednesday the evidence he has seen so far points to ""election tabulation malpractice."" Private experts and state election officials differ on whether the evidence shows a pattern of potential fraud or simply gross incompetence in the county that encompasses Atlanta. But they are mostly united for the first time that the top election supervisors in Fulton County should be removed. Some officials are even discussing a dramatic intervention like putting the county's election system in conservatorship so it can be run by state, not local, officials. ""I have continued to call on the elections director to be removed from his position, and the leadership of Fulton County has continued to fail to act,"" Raffensperger told Just the News on Wednesday. The secretary said he stands by his private monitor's assessment that fraud did not occur at a scale in Fulton County to impact the election's outcome, but he added the county's election management failures nonetheless warrant dramatic repair. ""It is no secret that Fulton has had issues in their elections department for decades, which is why I insisted on a state monitor being present to be eyes and ears on the ground,"" he said. ""He did not see any evidence of fraud despite having full access, but he saw continued mismanagement, miscommunication, unpreparedness, and sloppiness. Georgia voters deserve better."" Fulton County election officials did not respond to repeated requests seeking comment. Just the News reviewed the documents Raffensperger's office collected from Fulton County during a risk-limiting audit conducted last November. Among the problems those memos exposed: More than 100 batches of absentee ballots — each containing approximately 100 or more ballots — were assigned tracking numbers before being sent to one of the five absentee vote-counting machines in Fulton County but are not subsequently recorded in the handwritten logs showing which batches were scanned and counted, raising concerns the ballots may be missing. More than two dozen batches of absentee ballots were identified as having been double-scanned on the tally sheets. Five sequential batches of absentee votes each appeared with the exact same vote count of 392 for Biden, 96 for President Donald Trump, and 3 for Libertarian Jo Jorgensen, a count that state officials admitted was a statistical impossibility. Many control sheets for absentee ballot batches counted during the state's audit did not check a box indicating the ballot came from a secure container, raising the possibility that ballots were stored insecurely or that multiple batches of ballots were sealed in a single container. An official working for Raffensperger, who reviewed the documents flagged by Just the News, said they were clear evidence of significant human failure in Fulton County's election administration. The official said, for instance, the identical ballot batches likely resulted in about 1,000 extra votes being tallied. File  batches1.pdf The official also said some of the gaps in the absentee ballots might be explained by mistakes in which county officials mixed absentee ballots counted by one machine for another. But he acknowledged other gaps in ballot batches defy immediate explanation and would require extensive investigation to determine if something more nefarious than incompetence was at work. A second state official said the shoddy nature of the Fulton County paperwork left open the possibility fraud or other misconduct occurred. ""An audit is only as good as the data that's input, and in this case Fulton County's records are so problematic I'm not sure a reasonable person can trust them,"" the official said. ""When you add in the reports of ballots magically appearing under tables or being moved out of the counting center, there are legitimate outstanding questions."" The findings of the Just the News review closely mirror those of the private audit conducted by Cheeley's team under the judge's supervision. A private fraud expert hired by Cheeley, the forensic accountant David Sawyer, specifically flagged scores of batches of absentee ballots that appeared missing from the documents and more than two dozen batches of absentee ballots that appear to have been double or triple-counted in Fulton County. Sawyer said the fact that ballot batch numbers are missing from the Fulton County audit documents ""contradicts the concepts of completeness and existence and accuracy"" of the November audit, and ""should have been readily apparent to anyone who is performing a reconciliation, let alone an audit."" ""These need to be more fully investigated, and they indicate the possibility that there are missing batches that might not have been counted,"" Sawyer testified. County lawyers who cross-examined Sawyer offered little explanation or pushback before the judge officially ordered all absentee ballots unsealed so Cheeley's team could investigate more deeply. That process is ongoing. Cheeley told Just the News on Wednesday night his ongoing audit has now flagged many thousands of absentee ballots that haven't been properly accounted or suffer other serious problems. ""Fulton County's inability to account for so many batches reported from a November hand recount audit amounts to election tabulation malpractice,"" he said. ""Anyone who can count should know that is unacceptable. This evidence produced in court on May 21 justified the audit which Judge Amero ordered of the absentee ballots and envelopes.""",Georgia audit documents expose significant election failures in state's largest county,false
568,70777710312636365284863748950531163151,"Donald Trump would defeat both President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris if the former president decides to run in 2024, a new poll revealed Thursday. According to a Rasmussen Reports poll, in a race between Trump and Biden in 2024, 51 percent of possible voters said they would vote for Trump, whereas just 41 percent said they would choose Biden. Independent voters would also overwhelmingly choose the GOP candidate, selecting Trump over Biden by 20 points. The gap in a Trump versus Harris election is even bigger, with Trump topping the Vice President 52 percent to 39 percent. Additionally, one-fifth of Democrats said they would pick Trump rather than either Biden or Harris. When survey participants were asked whether or not Trump should run for president again, 48 percent of likely voters said he should run, while 44 percent said he should not. The Rasmussen poll was conducted from September 21-22 and surveyed 1,000 likely voters. President Biden’s approval rating among Americans continues to drop as a number of crises grip the United States, including thousands of illegal immigrants crossing the southern border, Americans stranded in Afghanistan following Biden’s disastrous withdrawal, and looming COVID-19 mandates. According to a recent Gallup poll, the president’s approval sits in negative territory at just 43 percent, dropping 6 points in one month alone. The survey, which was conducted from September 1-17, also showed that Biden has a 53 percent disapproval rate. “Independents have shown the greatest variation in their opinions of how Biden is doing. Biden’s current 37% approval rating among independents is his lowest to date and 24 points below his personal high of 61%. Two-thirds of Biden’s slide among independents since he took office has occurred in the past three months,” Gallup noted in the survey. Former President Trump has hinted that he will run for the White House again in 2024. On Saturday, September 25, Mr. Trump is holding another rally in Georgia as a “continuation of President Trump’s many appearances in support of candidates and causes that further the MAGA legacy and accomplishments of President Trump’s Administration.” On Wednesday, former President Trump wrote in an email provided to American Military News that “we are losing our country.” “We are losing our Country! The Democrats are vicious and fight like hell, and the Republicans do nothing about it. RINOs fight harder against Republicans than they do against Democrats. They want to be so politically correct, even if that means losing our Country, which is happening now,” Trump wrote, later adding, “Remember, the Fake News Media does not report the truth!”",Rasmussen poll: Trump beating Biden 51%-41% in 2024 presidential poll,other
569,4750758311945238517505811878496450047,"The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) approved a measure last month that could pave the way for the Catholic Church to deny President Joe Biden communion. The conservative bishops hope to prevent Biden from participating in the sacred ritual because of his support for abortion rights. Biden is a devout Catholic who considered becoming a priest in his youth. He rarely misses mass, holds a rosary while making critical decisions, and often quotes scriptures. When asked about the bishops' decision Biden said it is ""a private matter and I don't think that's going to happen."" The bishops hope the new guidance would push ""Catholics who are cultural, political, or parochial leaders to witness the faith."" Monsignor Jeffrey Burrill, the general secretary of the USCCB, has been forced to step down due to some serious allegations about his private life. Burrill, a priest from Wisconsin, worked for the USCCB for the past five years and was elected general secretary last year. ""On Monday, we became aware of impending media reports alleging possible improper behavior by Msgr. Burrill. What was shared with us did not include allegations of misconduct with minors. However, in order to avoid becoming a distraction to the operations and ongoing work of the Conference, Monsignor has resigned effective immediately,"" Archbishop Jose Gomez wrote in a memo to U.S. bishops. The PIllar, a Catholic publication, found evidence that the priest engaged in ""serial sexual misconduct."" An analysis of Burrill's phone found that it was emitting data signals from Grindr, a location-based hookup app, on a near-daily basis during parts of 2018, 2019, and 2020. Grindr is an app designed to bring together gay and bisexual men for sexual encounters. Signals showed that he also visited gay bars and private residences associated with the app. While using an app to meet people for sexual encounters shouldn't be frowned upon, it's a big no-no in the Catholic church. Especially for someone in a leadership position. Friar Thomas Berg, a professor of moral theology at St. Joseph's Seminary in Yonkers, New York, told The Pillar that use of such apps is strictly against Catholic doctrine. Berg said that ""according to canon law and the Church's tradition, clerics are obliged to observe 'perfect and perpetual continence,' as a reflection of what should be our lived pursuit of our spousal relationship with the Church and with Christ."" Homosexuality, along with all sexual activity outside of heterosexual marriage, is considered a sin in Catholic doctrine. Burrill appears to be an even bigger hypocrite because the USCCB has opposed LGBTQ equality, same-sex adoption, and the development of an LGBTQ suicide hotline. It has also promoted anti-trans legislation. It always seems to be that the religious folks who judge the harshest always wind up having something to hide. It's a shame that Catholics such as Burrill are forced by doctrine to live their lives in the shadows. But shouldn't that make them more compassionate towards fellow sinners instead of the first to judge?",Catholic leader whose organization voted to deny Biden communion caught using gay dating app,other

Following the Jan. 6 Capitol incursion, in which the congresswoman was never in any apparent danger, she has disclosed she is in therapy. Ocasio-Cortez also compared the experiences of lawmakers on that day to those of troops who have fought in actual combat. During an interview published last week with Latino USA, the New York Democrat spoke extensively about the riot that briefly suspended now-President Joe Biden’s Electoral College certification. That riot was so emotionally scarring, according to AOC, that lawmakers, such as herself, might as well have “served in war” after the legislative process was briefly disrupted. Advertisement - story continues below “It’s politically sensitive. No one wants to discuss, no one wants to say, ‘oh, boo-hoo,’ but there’s members of Congress that, served in war,” she said, before describing how she worried about how safe Capitol employees, such as food service workers, were during the incursion. She then talked about the aftermath of the violence on herself.“After the 6th, I took some time and it was really [Democratic Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts], when I spoke to her what happened to me, like the day of, because I ran to her office and she was like, ‘you need to recognize trauma,’” Ocasio-Cortez told the outlet. How bad was that “trauma?” So severe that the second-term Democratic House member said she’s in therapy to cope with the experience. “Oh yeah, I’m doing therapy but also I’ve just slowed down,” she said. “I think the Trump administration had a lot of us, especially Latino communities, in a very reactive mode. And so, I’ve been putting myself in a more practice space.” AOC in fact compared her perception of the Capitol incursion to the death of her father.“I was freezing, but I just felt like I needed to be away from all these people and all of this, like, you know, busyness,” she said.“It’s been so therapeutic… I feel like it’s been one of the most helpful things for me in resetting than almost anything else that I’ve done.” What an insult to combat veterans everywhere. Ironically, AOC wasn’t even in the Capitol building during the riot which she claimed has left her traumatized. The lawmaker was actually in the nearby Cannon building.In a February fact-check in which The Associated Press attempted to prop up AOC’s embellishing the event, the wire service noted the following: “In an Instagram Live video about the riots, she explained that she was in her office in a neighboring building on the Capitol complex, where she experienced a frightening encounter with a Capitol police officer who she said didn’t announce himself.” The AP added: “Ocasio-Cortez’s office is across the street from the main Capitol building, in the Cannon building, which AP reporters on the scene confirmed was evacuated during the riots.” “The Cannon building is also connected to the Capitol building by a series of tunnels, which allow members of Congress to travel between buildings underground,” the AP added. You’d think from hearing AOC speak about Jan. 6 that she was wielding an office chair and fending off MAGA raiders. In fact, her only notable tense interaction with anyone, as far as she has disclosed, was with a cop who knocked on a door to check on her in a separate building. That’s not exactly a harrowing tale of survival. AOC almost certainly belongs in therapy, but it’s difficult to believe her claims that that treatment is rooted in the events of Jan. 6.","AOC Announces She's in Therapy After Jan. 6, Implies Lawmakers Effectively",other

Speaking during a news conference, Mississippi State Health Officer Thomas Dobbs said those deaths had occurred since the start of the pandemic. The number, which includes only deaths that occurred past 20 weeks of gestation, “is twice the background rate of what would be expected,” he said. “That’s quite a number of tragedies that, sadly, would be preventable right now,” Dobbs said, referring to the availability of vaccines. He said the state is also investigating the deaths of eight pregnant women who were infected with the virus. Those deaths occurred over approximately the past four weeks, during the delta variant-fueled surge, he said. Many underwent emergency Caesarean sections in an attempt to save their babies. Advertisement Citing those cases, Dobbs and other state health leaders urged those who are pregnant to get the shot that can protect them from the virus. “We encourage you to please get vaccinated,” said State Epidemiologist Paul Byers, noting that his daughter had recently delivered a healthy baby after rolling up her sleeve. “That’s going to be the best way to ensure that you and your babies stay healthy.” Research has found that pregnant and recently pregnant women face a higher risk of becoming severely ill from covid-19, with an increased likelihood of requiring hospitalization, intensive care and use of a ventilator. Those who contract the virus in pregnancy are also at greater risk of preterm birth. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last month began urging coronavirus vaccination in pregnant women, after studies found no increased risk of miscarriage among those who got the shots. Immunization rates are low in the expectant population, with just 24 percent having received at least one shot, according to the CDC. Advertisement “The vaccines are safe and effective, and it has never been more urgent to increase vaccinations as we face the highly transmissible Delta variant and see severe outcomes from covid-19 among unvaccinated pregnant people,” CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said in a statement last month. In Mississippi, the overall vaccination rate has remained stubbornly low. With just under 40 percent fully vaccinated and 48 percent partially vaccinated, its vaccination rate is second-to-last in the nation. The delta variant has hit hard in the state, where recent weeks have been the worst of the pandemic, according to data compiled by The Washington Post. The average number of infections was hovering at about 2,800, down from the 3,586 recorded Aug. 20, but still far above the numbers seen before this summer. Advertisement Almost 1,300 people were hospitalized, and the state recorded its highest number of deaths in a single day Monday, with 124. Per capita, it is now second in the nation in total coronavirus deaths, at 285. (New Jersey, the leader in deaths per capita, stands at 303.) Dobbs lamented the state’s standing during a live-streamed discussion Friday with Mississippi State Medical Association President Mark Horne, saying that “it doesn’t have to be this way.” “In Mississippi, we’re complacent about being last,” Dobbs said. “Aren’t we? And if you see some folks out there talking, they’re saying, ‘This is inevitable; people are going to die; it’s not worth trying.’ That is a loser mentality, right? Other people don’t do this badly.” He noted that the state recorded almost 900 deaths in August, including 61 people who were between 18 and 31 years old. Advertisement “Not a single one of them was vaccinated,” Dobbs said. “I feel confident, if they had been vaccinated, every single one of those people would be with us today.

These new documents reveal that OCME submitted a request for permission to cremate Babbitt only two days after taking custody of her body and that ‘due to the “high profile nature” of Babbitt’s case, Deputy Chief Medical Examiner Francisco Diaz requested that a secure electronic file with limited access be created for Babbitt’s records. Additionally, Babbitt’s fingerprints were emailed to a person supposedly working for the DC government, which resulted in Microsoft “undeliverable” messages written in Chinese characters being returned. Babbitt was shot and killed by an unidentified law enforcement officer as she attempted to climb through a broken interior window in the Capitol Building, located outside the Speaker’s Lobby off the House Floor during the January 6 disturbance. She was unarmed. At the time of the shooting, several officers reportedly can be seen in videos, standing in the crowd of protestors in which Babbitt was present. The records were obtained in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit concerning two FOIA requests submitted by Judicial Watch on April 8, 2021 to the Metropolitan Police Department and the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner for records related to Babbitt’s death (Judicial Watch v. The District of Columbia (No. 2021 CA 001710 B)). The newly obtained records reveal: On January 8, 2021, at 7:13 p.m., an application to cremate the body of Babbitt is labeled “completed successfully.” Copies of the permit are sent to OCME officials Kimberli Hall and SaVern Fripp, as well as Melinda Smith, Jennifer Love, Lisa Tabron, Jeanette Belle, and Perlieshia Gales. In a January 6, 2021, email sent at 9:48 p.m. from OCME official Denise Lyles to medical examiner Francisco Diaz, the subject line is, “Case #21-00106 ID Confirmed.” [Case 21-00106 was Ashli Babbitt’s file number.] On January 6, 2021, at 9:43 p.m., Lyles emails OCME official Dr. Jennifer Love an attachment with the message, “I am updating the information we received from IAD [Internal Affairs Division] re the confirmed ID for OCME Case #21-00106 [Ashli Babbitt’s case]. These are the prints that returned from the FBI, that the detectives from IAD provided. I dropped them in the e-case file. Their names are noted below.” Lyles appears to have forwarded the file after having received it at 9:33 p.m. on January 6 from someone (whose name is redacted) within the Prince George’s County, MD, Police Criminal Investigation Division, assigned to the “Homicide Unit – FBI/Cross Border Task Force.” The file had been sent to that person at 9:30 p.m. on January 6 from someone with the email address efcon@gmw00001.str0.ngi.cjis. On January 6, 2021, at 7:42 p.m., OCME official Jamie Spann emailed a scanned file called “21-00106 FBI Submission Form” to Grant Greenwalt, Manager of the Crime Scenes Sciences unit of the DC Department of Forensic Sciences, as well as someone with the email address spc@leo.gov, and copying medical examiners Francisco Diaz and Jennifer Love, asking, “Please run the attached prints.” This document contained Ashli Babbitt’s fingerprints. Greeenwalt forwards the request to David Chumbley, an officer of the DC Police Department. Chumbley forwards the prints on from his iPhone at 8:06 p.m. on January 6 to someone identified as Jamese Kororma within the DC government. The email sent to “Jamese Kororma” resulted in multiple Microsoft “undeliverable” messages being returned, written in what appear to be Chinese characters. On January 7, 2021, Forensics photographer Matthew Brown emailed OCME colleagues regarding Babbitt’s case with “High” importance,” stating, “Due to the high-profile nature of case 21-00106, Dr. Diaz has requested limited access to this case. Please create a secure folder on the photo server for case 21-00106 and provide access only to the following OCME staff: Dr. Mitchell, Dr. Diaz, Anna Francis, Matthew Brown.” Brown adds, “Currently there are no images or folders on the photo server for this case. The images are being held on the OCME archiving server until a secure folder is created.” Michael Coleman, OCME’s Chief Information Officer, responded two hours later, “The requested directory has been created with the stipulated access granted. Please let me know if any additional adjustments are required.” Brown replies, “Thank you Mike. The case photos are now available on the server.” Responding separately to Coleman, OCME Records Manager Anna Francis says, “I have restricted the e-case file as well. For work purposes, the following groups have access, please let me know if permissions should be limited further: 1. Anna Francis; 2. MLI Investigations; 3. Medical Examiners; 4. Michael Coleman; 5.

Babbitt – partner/husband notified.” The records include identification records for “Ashli Elizabeth Pamatian,” including a copy of an FBI fingerprint submission card, a State Department visa check record “for identification purposes,” and a separate FBI fingerprint submission card that indicated that the “Official Taking Fingerprints” in the Babbitt case was “E. Betts.” Additionally, Babbitt’s body was listed as “Unidentified female” and “WF.” The DC government form included in the records states: “The District of Columbia Office of Chief Medical Examiner has recovered human remains and is requesting AFIS fingerprint database searches for identification purposes,” and the “transaction type” on the form indicates “Unidentified Deceased (DEU Transaction). The comments section notes, “Please attempt to identify this unidentified female who was discovered deceased on 01/06/2021 in Washington, DC.” The form asks the response to be faxed to OCME. official Jennifer Love. An X-ray log sheet indicates that three “LODOX” images of Babbitt’s body were taken by a technician with the initials RK. In an email on January 18, 2021, Deputy Chief Medical Examiner Francisco Diaz sends an attachment with Babbitt’s case file number to OCME officials Kristina Giese and Kimberly Golden stating, “Please review this homicide.” In an email on March 1, 2021, OCME official Cheryle Adams messaged colleagues Beverly Fields and Dr. Francisco Diaz (copying Mayor’s office spokeswoman Olivia Dedner), advising them that she was providing an updated spreadsheet of reporters seeking information on the people who died at “the January 6, 2021, Insurrection at the Capitol. “There is intense public interest in the shooting of Ashli Babbitt at the Capitol on January 6,” stated Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton. “The continued secrecy and delayed release of information about the shooting death of Ashli Babbitt are suspicious and smacks of politics. That Americans still have no information about who killed her or any police report about her death is a scandal of epic proportions.” The Metropolitan Police Department has not yet responded to Judicial Watch’s FOIA request. This document release is part of Judicial Watch’s ongoing investigation into the January 6 disturbance. In March, Judicial Watch filed a FOIA lawsuit against the District of Columbia for documents about the death of Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick. Pressure from this lawsuit helped lead to the disclosure that Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick died of natural causes. Judicial Watch also filed lawsuits for U.S. Capitol Police emails and video related to the riot and for Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s communications with the Pentagon in the days after the January 6 incident.",Judicial Watch: New Documents reveal the DC Office of the Chief Medical Examiner Submitted a Request to Cremate Ashli Babbitt Two Days after Gaining Custody of Her Body,false
573,30834361431084899615763750339558042900,"Black Lives Matter activists fumed on Tuesday afternoon after a Minneapolis jury returned a verdict convicting former Minneapolis police Derek Chauvin on all counts, manslaughter and murder, in the death of George Floyd last May. The jury took less than a day to deliver the verdict, a move that surprised many who were expecting deliberations to take at least a few days. Chauvin now faces up to 75 years in prison when he is sentenced in several weeks. Following the verdict, journalist Drew Hernandez hit the streets of Minneapolis and recorded the reaction of far-left Black Lives Matter activists for the news. “Yes, we can defund the police,” one BLM supporter shouted. “And maybe one day we will abolish the police, but we ain’t gonna do s**t unless we have control over them. That is the number one thing right now. … We’re not gonna let these pigs in these buildings have any more control over our lives today. That s**t ends today.”Another BLM supporter called for people to attack “the system” from “every single f***ing angle” and to “go way beyond voting at this point.”
“We need to go way beyond voting at this point,” the BLM supporter said. “We need to be coming out here every single day if that’s what it takes, until we get justice for the people that they murdered a week ago that they’ve already forgotten about. … The only reason once again, that we got this conviction, is because we showed up. And if we don’t keep showing up, and if we don’t change laws, and we don’t attack this system, from every single f***ing angle we can, we will be here again.” Another BLM supporter said that they are “never gonna be satisfied” and suggested without evidence that what was happening, presumably in the U.S. justice system, constituted a “black genocide.”
“We’re not, we’re never gonna be satisfied,” the BLM supporter said. “Black Lives Matter isn’t a trend. It’s a movement. Black Lives Matter forever, okay? So, we’re not gonna stop just because we’ve got one conviction. We’re happy with the conviction, but we’re gonna keep going. … This is a black genocide. This is more than one case. We’re not satisfied.” Another BLM supporter said that it was “epic” that the Minneapolis Police Department precinct that Chauvin was based out of “burned to the ground.”
“Derrick Chauvin’s Police Department burned to the ground. So we have to remember, those people are still facing challenges for arson. We have to remember that we just set us up a map once again because that was epic!” Another BLM supporter, who self-identified as a “revolutionary,” repeatedly screamed and appeared to urge extreme action in altering the U.S. justice system.","Black Lives Matter Activists Following Conviction: ‘We’re Never Gonna Be Satisfied,’ ‘Burn It Down!’",false
574,278856121892408593020034425765579473645,"There is renewed hope that America may soon be saved from Nancy Pelosi’s reign of terror according to a new poll showing that the Democrats are likely to lose control of the House Of Representatives next year. Despite losing seats in November’s elections, Pelosi has doubled down on extremism with her entire caucus unified behind pushing through Joe Biden’s radical agenda. This agenda includes D.C. statehood, new voting laws that will imperial election integrity, sweeping new “domestic terrorism” legislation that would unleash the government on Trump supporters and the illegal immigration disaster. Those positions do not have support according to the survey conducted by the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) that shows that Pelosi is by far the most unpopular politician in the country and her party is widely despised. According to a memo released by NRCC, voters in “ticket-splitting” districts that went for Trump; “Democrats in these districts are going to have an uphill battle defending their decisions to vote in lockstep with Pelosi’s socialist agenda.” There is also the matter of the Democrats’ support of the violent race riots that have terrorized Americans most recently seen when Rep. Maxine Waters traveled to Minneapolis to encourage rioting and looting right before the verdict in the George Floyd murder trial and Rep. Rashida Tlab’s call for eliminating the police who she accused of engaging in “government funded’ murder.The poll was conducted across 85 battleground congressional districts also finds that: a majority “do not believe that President Biden’s COVID-19 stimulus is helping them and their family,” that most “do not believe the Democrats’ false promises that Biden’s proposed tax increases will just be on the wealthy,” and that “an overwhelming 75 percent “of voters see the border situation as a crisis or a major problem.” There is also much skepticism over Biden’s out-of-control spending, much of it driven by his big “infrastructure” bill that is less about repairing roads and bridges and more about far-left social engineering, race-based giveaways, and Green New Deal priorities like electric cars. Further adding to Democrats’ woes is the coming loss of House seats in California, New York, and other blue states due to the U.S. Census Bureau’s announcement that population shifts out of the party’s strongholds have resulted in residents fleeing for freer and safer destinations.For the first time ever, Pelosi’s home state has lost a seat. And while it won’t officially shift until after the midterm elections, it marks a trend as California has increasingly become a dystopian, authoritarian hellscape due to decades of ruinous Democrat rule. People are voting with their feet and are leaving in droves to relocate to free states like Florida and Texas which will both get more House seats.
Democrats are going to have a hard time generating the same kind of voter enthusiasm as they did in 2018 and 2020. That could lead to them facing a bloodbath next year that ends Pelosi’s era of legislative terrorism and banishes them from power for a good long time.

579,25189218998598738555640399175922836051,"Fresh suspicion that Covid may have been tinkered with in a lab emerged today after scientists found genetic material owned by Moderna in the virus's spike protein. They identified a tiny snippet of code that is identical to part of a gene patented by the vaccine maker three years before the pandemic. It was discovered in SARS-CoV-2's unique furin cleavage site, the part that makes it so good at infecting people and separates it from other coronaviruses. The structure has been one of the focal points of debate about the virus's origin, with some scientists claiming it could not have been acquired naturally. The international team of researchers suggest the virus may have mutated to have a furin cleavage site during experiments on human cells in a lab. They claim there is a one-in-three-trillion chance Moderna's sequence randomly appeared through natural evolution. But there is some debate about whether the match is as rare as the study claims, with other experts describing it as a 'quirky' coincidence rather than a 'smoking gun'. In the latest study, published in Frontiers in Virology, researchers compared Covid's makeup to millions of sequenced proteins on an online database. The virus is made up of 30,000 letters of genetic code that carry the information it needs to spread, known as nucleotides.It is the only coronavirus of its type to carry 12 unique letters that allow its spike protein to be activated by a common enzyme called furin, allowing it to spread between human cells with ease. Analysis of the original Covid genome found the virus shares a sequence of 19 specific letters with a genetic section owned by Moderna, which has a total of 3,300 nucleotides. WHAT IS THE FURIN CLEAVAGE SITE? SARS-CoV-2, which causes Covid, carries all the information needed for it to spread in around 30,000 letters of genetic code, known as RNA. But it is the only coronavirus of its type to carry 12 unique letters that allow it to be activated by a common enzyme called furin. This in turn makes the virus better at invading neighbouring cells. The so-called furin cleavage site is located on the virus' spike protein, the structure that binds to human cells in the first place. Scientists sometimes add this element to lab viruses to make them more infectious, but in nature, pathogens can acquire it by swapping genetic code with other members of their family. The furin has been the focal point of intrigue for many scientists studying the origins of the virus because no other known member of Covid's family  - a group called Sarbecoviruses - have the site. ADVERTISEMENT The US-based pharmaceutical firm filed the patent in February 2016 as part of its cancer research division, records show. The patented sequence is part of a gene called MSH3 that is known to affect how damaged cells repair themselves in the body. Scientists have highlighted this pathway as a potential target for new cancer treatments. Twelve of the shared letters make up the structure of Covid's furin cleavage site, with the rest being a match with nucleotides on a nearby part of the genome. Writing in the paper, led by Dr Balamurali Ambati, from the University of Oregon, the researchers said the matching code may have originally been introduced to the Covid genome through infected human cells expressing the MSH3 gene. Professor Lawrence Young, a virologist at Warwick University, admitted the latest finding was interesting but claimed it was not significant enough to suggest lab manipulation. He told MailOnline: 'We're talking about a very, very, very small piece made up of 19 nucleotides. 'So it doesn't mean very much to be frank, if you do these types of searches you can always find matches. 'Sometimes these things happen fortuitously, sometimes it's the result of convergent evolution (when organisms evolve independently to have similar traits to adapt to their environment). 'It's a quirky observation but I wouldn't call it a smoking gun because it's too small. He added: 'It doesn't get us any further with the debate about whether Covid was engineered.' Dr Simon Clarke, a microbiologist at Reading University, questioned whether the find was as rare as the study claims. He told MailOnline: 'There can only be a certain number of [genetic combinations within] furin cleavage sites. 'They function like a lock and key in the cell, and the two only fit together in a limited number of combinations. 'So it's an interesting coincidence but this is surely entirely coincidental.' MailOnline has approached Moderna for comment. Circumstantial evidence has long raised questions about the origin of Covid and its link to the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The facility was known to be conducting experiments on bat coronavirus strains similar to the one responsible for the pandemic. China insisted early and often that the virus did not leak from the lab, claiming that crossover to humans must have occurred at a 'wet market' in Wuhan that sold live animals. Perhaps driven by animosity for then-US President Donald Trump, who embraced the lab leak theory early on, mainstream media and academics in the West heaped scorn on the possibility, calling it an unhinged conspiracy theory. But leaked emails showed that top scientists advising the UK and US Governments expressed concerns about the official narrative privately.Sir Jeremy Farrar, an eminent British expert who publicly denounced the theory as a 'conspiracy', admitted in a private email in February 2020 that a 'likely explanation' was that the virus was man-made. The then-UK Government adviser said at the time he was '70:30 or 60:40' in favour of an accidental release versus natural origin. In the email, sent to American health chiefs Dr Anthony Fauci and Dr Francis Collins, Sir Jeremy said it was possible Covid had been evolved from a Sars-like virus in the lab. He went on that this seemingly benign process may have 'accidentally created a virus primed for rapid transmission between humans'. But the British scientist was shut down by his counterparts in the US who warned further debate about the origins of the virus could damage 'international harmony'. In the latest twist, a study earlier this month found traces of Covid samples that contained genetical material from humans, hamsters and monkeys and may have predated the official pandemic timeline.",More evidence Covid was tinkered with in a lab?

580,174807144234208790524871622651097169360,"An FBI SWAT team raided the home of an activist mother of four in Colorado on Tuesday, Nov. 16, knocking down her door, bursting into the house with guns and handcuffing her while she was homeschooling her children. This is the first known case of the federal government making good on its promise to not only intimidate but actually carry out a raid on a mom who was involved in her local school board politics, said Brannon Howse, who interviewed Sherronna Bishop at Lindell TV Wednesday night. The U.S. Department of Justice and Attorney General Merrick Garland issued an Oct. 4 memorandum directing federal, state and local law enforcement to look for parents to prosecute nationwide who may have made “threats” and made “harassing” phone calls to school board members nationwide, equating such parents to domestic terrorists. Now a mother, Sherronna Bishop of Grand Junction, Colorado, has felt the brute force of the FBI’s heavily armed SWAT unit used against her family. Sherronna Bishop has been active in school board politics throughout Colorado and operates a website that helps educate parents nationwide about their children’s education. She was at home with her three children about 9:30 a.m. Tuesday when she heard someone pounding on the front door, then using a battering ram to break it down. She said the officers “manhandled” her 18-year-old daughter, pulling her up the stairs by her hoodie, while another officer put her in handcuffs and ushered her out of the house. They proceeded to search the entire house. UPDATE AS OF NOV. 19: The FBI has filed no charges against Bishop. Three of Bishop’s four children, ages 8, 10 and 18, were home at the time of the raid, as was her husband, who was also handcuffed. Her 17-year-old son was at his high school. Besides being a frequent attendee at her local school board meetings, Bishop has also been active in the voter integrity movement in her state and locality. She runs the website Americasmom.net, and on that site she features an article and video under the title We the Parents: How Did We Get Here? She said she has not been guilty of anything but speaking her mind in accordance with her First Amendment rights. “This is still the United States of America, where we are able to state what we think and we believe,” she told Howse. “There was some pounding on my door. I didn’t really know what to think, I thought at first it might be some neighbor kids. They were pounding profusely, and then it hit me it was the FBI. I took my kids to their bedrooms. They used a battering ram to bash down my door, they cuffed me. And then proceeded to search and go through my whole home.” She said the agents would not tell her why they were searching her home. They did leave behind documents related to the search warrant, saying they entered her home because she was suspected of causing “intentional damage to a protected computer, wire fraud and conspiracy to cause damage to a protected computer.” “I don’t know anything about this. They couldn’t explain any of this,” she said. “I will tell you why: they were at my home to intimidate me, to shut me up, because I was using my First Amendment rights to advocate for [Mesa County Clerk] Tina Peters on the issue of Dominion [voting machines] and the damage done in our election. And they’ll never be held accountable. Instead they will criminalize this woman who has stood up.” “I know people will say, well Sherronna, why don’t you just shut your mouth… That’s exactly what they hope you will do. I can open my mouth and say whatever I want to say and that is not a criminal action. This is about their desire to shut you down and stop you from saying it.” “I’m a law abiding citizen, I’m very supportive of law enforcement,” she continued. “I love the Constitution. And what happened yesterday, what happened is something I never imagined I would experience in America.” Bishop said she uses her website, AmericasMom.net, to educate and inform parents and moms regarding their children’s education. “And since then we’ve gotten involved in school board races. I love my state. I’m a fourth generation Coloradan. Most recently I’ve been a very vocal advocate of a candidate [Peters]… She’s had to fight for her own life, and a guess now I’ll have to fight for mine.” Bishop has been part of a group of parents that have been successful in fighting the teaching of critical race theory and school mask mandates. “Colorado was able to flip nine school boards this year. We were able to get one of our leftists to resign and we also flipped our school board in the election,” Bishop said. “And people like me are considered domestic terrorists now, because we don’t stand for the policies that have been forced upon our children.” Howse said history will be kind to Bishop. “I believe you will go down in history as the first mom targeted [by the FBI]. The FBI has said it plans to do this and I believe you are the first mom to have this done to you. Mask mandates, opposing critical race theory, election theft, which Biden said if you question that you are involved in subversion. But I believe you are the first mom to have been targeted and had your door literally busted down while you were homeschooling your kids.” Bishop said she has always made a point of being transparent. “I have always made myself available, I’ve never tried to hide from anything and now for them to bash my door down, manhandle my daughter… I think the timing is really interesting, because we don’t want people to be silent because of what happened to me. If anything I want people to be more vocal,… because this is still America and you still have the right to stand up for yourself and your family.” “I believe elections have consequences, and in this case this illegitimate regime is having serious consequences for all of America.” Howse asked if she ever thought she would be targeted in this way by her own government. “No I never thought in America that a suburban housewife and mom would have her door bashed in by the FBI,” she said. He asked about her three children. “My kids are very resilient. And part of schooling them has been to teach them the proper role of government and the proper role of law enforcement and I can’t convince them now that the FBI are good guys. And I really have my own doubts about that now. You cannot just say ‘I followed orders’ to go bash someone’s door down. They are responsible for what they are doing.” Howse had just concluded a series of interviews with a panel of four retired FBI agents just days before the raid in which they had described similar raids against non-violent patriotic Americans over the last few years, starting with Gen. Michael Flynn in 2016, followed by the pre-dawn raid on author and Trump ally Roger Stone in 2019 and then the violent entering of journalist James O’Keefe of Project Veritas just last week. “I was on the [FBI] SWAT team for several years,” said Brian Shepard, appearing with three other retired FBI agents at a symposium aired by WVW TV on Nov. 16. “And I can tell you from my experience, and I think all others of the bureau agents here would echo what I’m going to say. We never conducted a search or conducted an arrest of someone who was not a violent offender. And the thought when I heard about what happened with Roger Stone, just outraged me so much that, it just rose up inside me.” Now, an activist mom has been targeted, raising the question: Has the FBI become the political shock troops for the White House, seeking to harass and intimidate anyone who speaks out against its policies? Howse said it was obvious that Shepard became emotional when he began talking about how the bureau, he gave the better part of his life to serve, had now taken to bashing down the doors of non-violent American patriots. “Brian’s reaction is very typical of men in that generation who served in the FBI, and many of those men have responded the same way, because they gave the best years of their lives to the agency, and upheld what they believed were the values of the agency, bravery, integrity and fidelity, and they become emotional when they saw how this has been discarded. They are beside themselves. It happened to others and now it happens to you, within days of our filming [of the panel].” Bishop said the timing was not lost on her. “I can’t explain it. I can’t explain being a target, for an agency that typically takes down the cartel, human trafficking, and now I’ve had my children traumatized and if this can happen to me, they’ll come for you too.” “I made myself completely transparent to them and yet they chose to break down my door, terrorize my kids and try to intimidate me.” She said the agents took her phone and other devices and kept her handcuffed for at least 30 minutes. “No, I never had any access to any voting machines. They know I am just a voice, an advocate. We must have been effective. I know the people here, they’re not going to back down, and we’re not going to stop. In times past they never would have moved forward on this, but the narrative in America right now is one that is pushing a progressive narrative of communism. Now you can stay in your home and talk about it privately but you dare not come out and talk about it publicly …or they will send the FBI to your door because according to this regime you are a domestic terrorist. “We’ve got to stick together and we can’t let these thugs put us into fear and intimidation.” Howse said he was shocked by the news of Bishop’s experience. “I could see them moving against someone like me, or Mike Lindell. It is hard to see them coming after someone like you, to come after a mom, who is working at the school board level and the election level, and to bust your door down? This is totally unprecedented by the agency in how they conducted themselves. So even for someone who has studied communism and a color revolution, the way they are doing it and the pace at which they’re doing it, I never anticipated it to move this fast.”","It Begins: FBI raids house, terrorizes family of mom who protested local school board, elections",mixture

UK Health Security Agency (“UKHSA”) statistics are clear and so is the text which accompanies them. For people who feel overwhelmed by statistics and numbers there is sufficient information if we read the words contained in the UKHSA’s ‘Vaccine Surveillance Report’ (“VSR”). It is all hidden in plain sight and the BBC, and much of corporate media, should be, at the very least, labelled “co-conspirators” and censored for spreading misinformation and disinformation. Prior to the launch of the Covid injection campaign there were three statistics corporate media reminded us of daily, and repeatedly: cases, hospitalisations and deaths.  Since the Covid injection campaign began reporting these statistics must have become a mine field for them. Summary: UKHSA admits “asymptomatic cases” are not a concern for spreading Covid UKHSA does not use cases, positive PCR tests, to determine disease. UKHSA uses non-peer reviewed studies and a study prepared by their own public health officials to estimate a “vaccine effectiveness” of 90% protection against mortality. Real-world data shows a waning of protection until it flips and the opposite occurs – “vaccinated” people are at higher risk of hospitalisation and death.  “Vaccinated” people appear to be developing a vaccine-induced immunodeficiency disorder, a condition similar to AIDS. Biden's Plans for Retirement Accounts Biden's Plans for Retirement Accounts Vaccine effectiveness The VSR for week 45 (11 Oct- 7 Nov), page 5, states: “Large clinical trials have been undertaken for each of the Covid-19 vaccines approved in the UK which found that they are highly efficacious at preventing symptomatic disease in the populations that were studied … Vaccine effectiveness is estimated by comparing rates of disease in vaccinated individuals to rates in unvaccinated individuals.” On pages 5 to 8 of the VSR then describes “vaccine effectiveness” as measured using symptomatic disease, hospitalisations, mortality and transmission. UKHSA is admitting “asymptomatic cases” – healthy people – are no longer a cause for concern in controlling the spread of an infectious respiratory disease.  Doctors, scientists and many others have been highlighting this obvious fact from early on.  The BBC calls such people “conspiracy theorists.”  We expect the Trusted News Initiative will hunt UKHSA down, and Facebook (Meta), Twitter, Google, LinkedIn et al. will “fact check,” shadow ban and censor UKHSA as they have joined the “conspiracy theorists.” Vaccine effectiveness and cases We choose to ignore case numbers and case rates as we know the use of the PCR test to detect infection is fraudulent.  The BBC may think number of cases is important however UKHSA agrees, at least in part, with the “conspiracy theorists” and also chooses to ignore them. On page 23 the UKHSA states: “Comparing case rates among vaccinated and unvaccinated populations should not be used to estimate vaccine effectiveness against Covid-19 infection. Vaccine effectiveness has been formally estimated from a number of different sources and is summarised on pages 5 to 8 in this report.”   And on page 8 UKHSA states: “uninfected individuals cannot transmit” the virus. In other words, “vaccine effectiveness” is based on symptomatic disease, hospitalisations and death.  It follows that the UKHSA recommends ignoring case rates as presumably cases, positive PCR tests, are not a reliable indicator to establish infection or disease. Since March 2020, corporate media has groomed the public into believing cases, including asymptomatic, are key to controlling the “pandemic,” protecting the NHS and saving lives.  For well over a year cases and case rates, with the threat of imminent death, were used as a key measure to justify ruining lives and livelihoods by way of business shut-downs; bringing society to a standstill; and, imposing restrictions on our rights and freedoms.  From very early on corporate media referred to this as, and so instilled in the public’s psyche the idea of, “lockdown” – a term previously only used within prison environments. Let’s put the uncomfortable truth regarding “cases” another way. The number of Covid cases or projected number of cases has determined whether: our livelihoods were ruined; children missed vital education; hospital and medical appointments for all other illnesses and conditions were virtually stopped or at best downgraded to little more than a telephone call; surgical procedures were cancelled; and, whether people were able to get married, attend a funeral, celebrate religious holidays, visit the elderly, or visit dying relatives in hospital.  The falling or rising number of cases determined how “hard” the proposed “lockdown” would be. Now, when it comes to the number of rising cases post-Covid injection roll-out and how effective a so-called “vaccine” is in protecting the population from a “dangerous virus” – cases are, not only not key but, not a good measure of disease. If this obvious contradiction of how “cases” are being used to manipulate your behaviour does not anger you then you have either lost the ability to think for yourself or you have lost your humanity. Vaccine effectiveness, hospitalisation and deaths The evidence UKHSA uses to prove “vaccine effectiveness” against hospitalisation are “several studies.”  They reference four studies.  One study is regarding a single dose of Covid injection, one is to estimate real world effectiveness and two are preprints, not yet peer reviewed. The hospitalisations do not seem to be fitting their evidence.  In Table 4, page 19, of the 10,179 Covid patients hospitalised, almost two thirds had been “effectively vaccinated,” according to them, against hospitalisation. On page 7, UKHSA states “high levels of protection (over 90%) are also seen against mortality” and references three studies. Two are preprints, yet to be peer reviewed, and the third – a study to estimate real world effectiveness – is the same study as cited for “effectiveness against hospitalisation.”  It was published on 13 May 2021 by authors with affiliations as shown in the image below. Does real world data support the effectiveness estimated by public health officials? On page 20 and 21 of the VSR are tables of Covid deaths which show a “vaccinated” to “unvaccinated” ratio of 4,8:1. For every one “unvaccinated” person, there are at least four “vaccinated” people who die with Covid.  Alternatively, 82% of Covid deaths are post-Covid injection – far from 90% protection against mortality, rather it is almost as if the opposite is true. Below the table, on page 21, there is a footnote which attempts to make an excuse for the high mortality of the “vaccinated”: “even with a highly effective vaccine, it is expected that a large proportion of cases, hospitalisations and deaths would occur in vaccinated individuals, simply because a larger proportion of the population are vaccinated than unvaccinated and no vaccine is 100% effective.” Does the real-world data support UKHSA’s assumption that it is reasonable for more “vaccinated” people to be dying with Covid than “unvaccinated”?  Not according to ONS data. Deaths dramatically increased, above the five year average, two months after the Covid injection campaign was launched. The UK launched its Covid injection campaign on 8 December 2020.  According to the UK government’s ‘Deaths within 28 days of positive test by date of death’ there were 63,830 Covid deaths before the launch of the Covid injection roll-out.  Since then, up to 10 November 2021, there has been 78,922 Covid deaths.  There have been more Covid deaths post-Covid injection roll-out than before it began. If the Covid injection was 90% effective in preventing death, why are “vaccinated” people currently dying at a ratio of 4,8:1 to “unvaccinated” people? In a previous article we wrote extensively about the real-world effectiveness of the Covid injections using VSR data over a three month period and the waning of effectiveness until it reverses and has the opposite effect.   For week 45, everyone over the age of 30 shows a negative vaccine effectiveness – the “unvaccinated” are better protected against Covid than the “fully vaccinated.”  The “vaccines” are destroying people’s immune systems – causing an immunodeficiency disorder, similar to AIDS, but vaccine-induced.  The correlation is unequivocally clear but corporate media is not reporting it.","COVID DEATH RATES 4 TO 1, VACCINATED TO UNVAXXED",false

584,234731274915637640064753890140228067747,"November 11, 2021, a rally formed outside of Lions Gate Hospital in North Vancouver, British Columbia (BC). The group was there to call attention to an unthinkable tragedy: 13 babies were reportedly stillborn at the hospital in a period of 24 hours. All of their mothers had received a COVID-19 injection.1 In a typical month, there may be one stillborn baby at the hospital, one of the protestors said, making the 13 stillbirths highly unusual. The only reason the deaths came to light was because several doulas came forward, detailing the events. Vancouver Coastal Health has disputed the reports of stillbirths at Lions Gate Hospital, stating, “There is no truth to this claim … There has been no notable change to the incidence of stillbirths in the VCH region throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.”2 However, after speaking with police outside of the hospital, Dr. Daniel Nagase and Dr. Mel Bruchet started an official investigation, and Nagase launched an official complaint with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police against executives at the College of Physicians & Surgeons of BC, alleging conflicts of interest influencing their policies, decisions and statements made to the people of British Columbia.3 If any of the executives hold stocks, bonds or mutual funds, for instance, that gain value with increased sales of pharmaceuticals, Nagase said, then that’s a conflict of interest that should have been declared. The implication is that it can also influence their likelihood of further investigating the unusual number of stillbirths that occurred at the hospital, particularly in relation to the COVID-19 jab that their mothers received. Spike in Newborn Baby Deaths in Scotland Scotland has also experienced an unusual rise in infant death rates. During September 2021, at least 21 babies under 4 weeks old died — a rate of 4.9 per 1,000 births. The average death rate among newborns in Scotland is about 2 per 1,000 births.4 Public Health Scotland (PHS), which is investigating the deaths, stated, “Exceeding the upper control limit indicates there is a higher likelihood that there are factors beyond random variation that may have contributed to the number of deaths,” adding that there was “currently no indication of links between these deaths and Covid-19 infection.”5 It’s unclear whether the COVID-19 injection in pregnant women will be evaluated as a contributing or causative factor, though it absolutely should be. PHS only said it was collaborating with the Scottish National Neonatal Network, the Maternity and Children Quality Improvement Collaborative and the Scottish Government “to understand any possible contributing factors to the most recent infant mortality patterns, and to incorporate findings into existing prevention and improvement work.”6 Fetal Deaths, Stillbirths Skyrocket in Injected Women As of November 12, 2021, there were 2,620 cases of fetal death or stillbirth among women who received a COVID-19 injection reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).7 Health Impact News ran the same VAERS search, but this time excluded COVID-19 injections — to look for fetal deaths in women who had been vaccinated with any vaccine other than a COVID-19 jab over the last 30+ years. They found:8  “We are currently on pace to see a yearly total of 2,838 recorded fetal deaths following COVID-19 shots, while the yearly average of recorded fetal deaths following the vaccination of pregnant women for the past 30 years has been an average of 74 fetal deaths per year.” Health officials are adamant that pregnant women get a COVID-19 injection, but the data don’t support its safety. The CDC-sponsored study9 published in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) that was widely used to support the U.S. recommendation for pregnant women to get injected was corrected in October 2021, with the correction stating:10  “In the table footnotes, the following content should have been appended to the double dagger footnote:  “No denominator was available to calculate a risk estimate for spontaneous abortions, because at the time of this report, follow-up through 20 weeks was not yet available for 905 of the 1224 participants vaccinated within 30 days before the first day of the last menstrual period or in the first trimester. Furthermore, any risk estimate would need to account for gestational week–specific risk of spontaneous abortion.” Data Used to Support COVID-19 Shot in Pregnant Women Flawed In a rapid communication from the Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge (IPAK), Aleisha Brock, Ph.D. of New Zealand, and Simon Thornley, Ph.D., a senior lecturer in the section of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Auckland, explained that the NEJM study “presents falsely reassuring statistics related to the risk of spontaneous abortion in early pregnancy, since the majority of women in the calculation were exposed to the mRNA product after the outcome period was defined (20 weeks’ gestation).”11 When the risk of spontaneous abortion, or miscarriage, was recalculated based on the cohort that was injected prior to 20 weeks’ gestation, the incidence of miscarriage was seven to eight times higher than the original study indicated, with a cumulative incidence of miscarriage ranging from 82% to 91%. According to the IPAK report:12  “The study indicates that at least 81.9% (≥ 104/127) experienced spontaneous abortion following mRNA exposure before 20 weeks, and 92.3% (96/104) of spontaneous abortions occurred before 13 weeks’ gestation. This is a very high proportion of pregnancy loss observed in those exposed to the mRNA vaccination before 20 weeks’ gestation, ranging from 81.9–91.2% …  The authors’ interpretation of no difference in the observed incidence of pregnancy loss in those who received their first mRNA vaccine before 20 weeks’ gestation compared to baseline must be questioned.  In light of these findings, key policy decisions have been made using unreliable and questionable data. We conclude that the claims made using these data on the safety of exposure of women in early pregnancy to mRNA-based vaccines to prevent COVID-19 are unwarranted and recommend that those policy decisions be revisited.” RELATED POSTS Maple Pecan Butternut Squash Dec 7, 2021 Is Gluten-Free Bread Healthier than Regular Bread? Dec 7, 2021 Why Are We Still Isolating Vaccinated People for 10 Days? Dec 7, 2021 Calls for Immediate Withdrawal of mRNA Shots Not only does the IPAK data show COVID-19 injections prior to 20 weeks are unsafe for pregnant women, but 12.6% women who received it in the 3rd trimester reported Grade 3 adverse events, which are severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening. Another 8% also reported a fever of 38 degrees C (100.4 degrees F), which can lead to miscarriage or premature labor.13 Further, the study follow-up only continued for 28 days after birth, meaning the long-term effects of prenatal exposure to babies is unknown. The many concerns of mRNA COVID-19 injections during pregnancy and breastfeeding include transmission of mRNA and spike protein across the placenta and through breast milk, as well as the inhibition of synctyin-1, a protein essential for cell fusion and placental development. Pregnant women were excluded from the mRNA injection clinical trials, but a Pfizer-BioNTech rat study revealed the injection more than doubled the incidence of preimplantation loss and also led to a low incidence of mouth/jaw malformations, gastroschisis (a birth defect of the abdominal wall) and abnormalities in the right-sided aortic arch and cervical vertebrae in the fetuses.14 Together, IPAK believes the data are compelling enough to withdraw the shots for vulnerable populations. Noting their advice in boldface, they say:15  “Considering the evidence presented here, we suggest the immediate withdrawal of mRNA vaccine use in pregnancy (Category X) and those breastfeeding, alongside the withdrawal of mRNA vaccines to children or those of child-bearing age in the general population, until more convincing data relating to the safety and long-term impacts on fertility, pregnancy and reproduction are established in these groups.” Vaccine Researcher: Menstrual Changes Related to Shot Women across the U.S. have reported changes in their menstrual cycles following COVID-19 shots. Changes include heavier, earlier and more painful periods,16 as well as unexpected breakthrough bleeding or spotting among women on long-acting contraception or those who are postmenopausal and hadn’t had a period in years or even decades.17 Health officials have tried to brush off the reports, but they’ve become too numerous to ignore. Gunnveig Grødeland, a Norwegian vaccine researcher with the University of Oslo and Oslo University Hospital, told TV2.no, “There are sufficient numbers of women who are experiencing changes, not just in Norway, but also abroad, to make it likely that this is connected to the vaccine.”18,19 The Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH) is currently studying menstrual bleeding in 60,000 Norwegian women aged 11 to 80 years to explore whether irregularities are linked to COVID-19 injections. “We cannot rule out that there is a connection between these menstrual irregularities and the vaccine. We take these reports seriously and are doing a thorough job in order to study possible correlations,” Lill Trogstad with the NIPH told TV2.no.20 Kate Clancy, a human reproductive ecologist and associate professor of anthropology at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and Katharine Lee, a biological anthropologist studying women’s health at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, also have more than 140,000 reports from those who’ve had changes in their period following COVID-19 injections, which they’re formally documenting in an open-ended study.21 Another 30,000 reports of period changes following the jabs have been reported to the U.K.’s regulator.22 The implication is that the shots could be having an effect on fertility, but officials have been quick to deny such a link. However, in an editorial published in the BMJ, Victoria Male, a lecturer in reproductive immunology at Imperial College London, stated that when it comes to menstrual changes after COVID-19 shots, “A link is plausible and should be investigated.”23 According to Male:24  “Menstrual changes have been reported after both mRNA and adenovirus vectored covid-19 vaccines, suggesting that, if there is a connection, it is likely to be a result of the immune response to vaccination rather than a specific vaccine component. Vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) has also been associated with menstrual changes.  … Biologically plausible mechanisms linking immune stimulation with menstrual changes include immunological influences on the hormones driving the menstrual cycle or effects mediated by immune cells in the lining of the uterus, which are involved in the cyclical build-up and breakdown of this tissue. Research exploring a possible association between covid-19 vaccines and menstrual changes may also help understand the mechanism.” You Can’t Make an Informed Decision Without the Facts At this time, women aren’t being warned about the potential risks for miscarriage, menstrual irregularities and even fertility that have been uncovered. But it’s an urgent matter that must be investigated so people can make an informed decision before consenting to an injection that could have serious reproductive effects. It should be widely known, however, that Janci Chunn Lindsay, Ph.D., a prominent toxicologist and molecular biologist who works with M.D. Anderson Cancer Center-Houston, spoke at the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices meeting April 23, 2021. The focus of the meeting was blood clotting disorders following COVID-19 shots, and Lindsay spoke during the public comment period, calling for “all gene therapy vaccines” to “be halted immediately due to safety concerns on several fronts,” including fertility.25 Lindsay warned that severe red flags exist that an entire generation could be at risk of sterilization if COVID-19 shots aren’t stopped until more research is conducted:26  “We simply cannot put these [vaccines] in our children who are at .002% risk for Covid mortality, if infected, or any more of the child-bearing age population without thoroughly investigating this matter. [If we do], we could potentially sterilize an entire generation. Speculation that this will not occur and a few anecdotal reports of pregnancies within the trial are not sufficient proof that this is not impacting on a population-wide scale.”",Sudden Surge in Stillbirths and Menstrual Changes,false
585,335500145991990906472673787922577910324,"London (CNN) — More than a third of the Antarctic ice shelf risks collapsing into the sea if global temperatures reach 4 degrees Celsius (7.2 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels as climate change warms the world, a new study from the UK's University of Reading has warned. In a forecasting study, scientists found that 34% of the area of all Antarctic ice shelves, measuring some half a million square kilometers, could destabilize if world temperatures were to rise by 4 degrees. Some 67% of the ice shelf area on the Antarctic Peninsula would be at risk of destabilization under this scenario, researchers said. Ice shelves are permanent floating platforms of ice attached to areas of the coastline, formed where glaciers flowing off the land meet the sea. They can help limit the rise in global sea levels by acting like a dam, slowing the flow of melting ice and water into the oceans. Each summer, ice at the surface of ice shelves melts and runs into smaller gaps in the snow below, where it usually refreezes. But when there is a lot of melting and little snowfall, this water instead pools onto the ice's surface or flows into crevasses. This deepens and widens the crevasses, causing the shelf to fracture and collapse into the sea. This huge iceberg calved from the Larsen C ice shelf. This huge iceberg calved from the Larsen C ice shelf. ""Ice shelves are important buffers preventing glaciers on land from flowing freely into the ocean and contributing to sea level rise. When they collapse, it's like a giant cork being removed from a bottle, allowing unimaginable amounts of water from glaciers to pour into the sea,"" study lead author Ella Gilbert, a climate scientist in the University of Reading's Department of Meteorology, said in a statement. Gilbert told CNN that low-lying coastal areas, particularly small island states such Vanuatu and Tuvalu, in the South Pacific Ocean, are most at risk from global sea level rise. ""However, coastal areas all over the world would be vulnerable, and countries with fewer resources available to mitigate and adapt to sea level rise will see worse consequences,"" she said. In the new study, which used high-resolution regional climate modeling to predict the impact of increased melting and water runoff on ice shelf stability, researchers say that limiting temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius rather than 4 degrees Celsius would halve the area at risk and potentially avoid significant sea level rise. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded in a landmark report that we only have until 2030 to drastically reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and prevent the planet from reaching the crucial threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels. This image shows a large iceberg which has separated from Pine Island Glacier. This image shows a large iceberg which has separated from Pine Island Glacier. Global net emissions of carbon dioxide would need to fall by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030 and reach ""net zero"" around 2050 in order to keep the warming around 1.5 degrees Celsius. ""The findings highlight the importance of limiting global temperature increases as set out in the Paris Agreement if we are to avoid the worst consequences of climate change, including sea level rise,"" Gilbert added. In the Paris accord, 197 countries agreed to the goal of holding global temperatures ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Antarctic sponges discovered under the ice shelf perplex scientists Related Article: Antarctic sponges discovered under the ice shelf perplex scientists But we are on track for a world that is 3.2 degrees Celsius warmer by the end of the century. Gilbert told CNN that increased temperatures means melting occurs more frequently, and more intensely. Researchers identified four ice shelves that would be threatened by a warmer climate: The Larsen C, Shackleton, Pine Island and Wilkins ice shelves, which are vulnerable due to their geography, and the runoff predicted in those areas. Larsen C is the largest remaining ice shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula, and the Pine Island glacier has received a lot of attention in recent years because it has been melting rapidly in response to climate change, Gilbert said. If these ice shelves all collapsed, which is not guaranteed, the glaciers they currently restrain would flow into the ocean, contributing to sea level rise -- potentially by tens of centimeters, she explained.

586,266458096915732106338301367990344886564,"With the surge of the Delta variant in Indonesia, misleading claims about products claiming to be cures and preventions are on the rise. Hospitals are struggling to cope with soaring numbers of patients and shortages of oxygen, and people are increasingly desperate to get help for sick family or friends. We have looked at some examples of health misinformation being shared. 1. Claims that an anti-parasite drug has been approved There have been growing numbers of Indonesians sharing claims about using the anti-parasitic drug, Ivermectin. Interest surged after local media reports said incorrectly that the Indonesian authorities had granted it emergency approval. But the drug is still undergoing trials, and is so far unproven as a cure for Covid. The reports were based on a 15 July statement issued by the Food and Drugs Authority of Indonesia (BPOM). But shortly afterwards, BPOM's head, Penny Lukito, told local media that no emergency approval had been given to Ivermectin. False news about EUA to ivermectin for covid treatment The confusion arose because the medicine was put on a list together with other drugs, two of which did have emergency approval. Ms Lukito explained that Ivermectin was included because it's undergoing clinical trials at eight hospitals, but the results are not expected until October and no approval has been given so far. Ivermectin was already being promoted as a treatment by some public figures, despite the World Health Organization's (WHO) warning that it should be used only under certain clinical settings. Health practitioner Reza Gunawan has been promoting Ivermectin on his Twitter account, where he has more than 350,000 followers. When we asked him why he was doing this, he replied: ""Ivermectin is relatively safe, low cost, effective, fast and easy to implement, and can complement the ongoing vaccination programme."" He added that he is not a medical doctor. The manufacturer, Merck, has said that there is no scientific study as yet that proves Ivermectin works against Covid-19. Dr Dicky Budiman, an epidemiologist at Australia's Griffith University, has said it should not be used unsupervised, and that there could be ""very serious side effects if it is not used under a doctor's supervision"". There are quite a few countries, including the UK, investigating it as a possible treatment. 2. Claims that a milk brand produces antibodies Several videos showing Indonesians rushing to buy up Nestle's Bear Brand milk have gone viral. Screengrab of Bear Brand milk product IMAGE SOURCE,EPA This happened after claims emerged on social media and WhatsApp groups that drinking this brand of milk could produce Covid antibodies. The price of the milk shot up by 455%. It is unclear where this claim originated, and there's no evidence that drinking milk can produce Covid antibodies. Nestle in Indonesia told the BBC that the company has never claimed their product can generate a Covid antibody response, which can only come from a vaccine or a previous infection. 3. Immunity 'boosters' and natural remedies Social media posts are being widely shared about a product called propolis, described as an immunity booster. Screengrab of social post promoting propolis against Covid Image caption, An example of a social media post promoting propolis to help fight Covid These have been circulating on Twitter and Facebook, with many claiming that the product helps protect you against Covid-19. Propolis is a natural substance produced by bees and sold as an alternative remedy to treat inflammation or sores. It has been certified for sale in Indonesia since 2018 as a traditional medicine and health supplement by the country's food and drugs regulator. Bee on coneflower IMAGE SOURCE,GETTY IMAGES Image caption, Propolis is a resin-like substance which bees use to build their hives ""British propolis"", as it's known in Indonesia, has an official Instagram account where claims have been made that it can help against viruses, but not specifically Covid-19. However, one post we saw on the official account talks about consuming this product ""in addition to wearing masks"" and refers to ""prevention from within by increasing the body's resistance."" There is no evidence that it does anything to prevent Covid infections. We contacted the company marketing the product in Indonesia to ask them about it, but had received no response by the time of publication.There've been lots of claims about ""immunity boosters"" during the pandemic, not just in Indonesia but in many other countries. We asked Dr Faheem Younus, who is head of infectious diseases at the University of Maryland in the US and tackles health myths on his Twitter handle. about the claims you can prevent Covid this way. He says the term ""immunity booster"" is very general, and there's no evidence these substances work against Covid. We've also seen claims being shared on social media around using other natural remedies against Covid in Indonesia. For example, there have been suggestions that you should drink or inhale cajeput oil, a plant-derived oil usually used to treat skin irritations, to prevent coronavirus.Again, this product is not shown to work against Covid-19. The oil has properties similar to eucalyptus oil, and in fact if inhaled it could cause respiratory issues and prove to be harmful.","Covid: Ivermectin, milk among Indonesia's unproven 'cures'",true

The wrangling over masks, considered by pediatricians and epidemiologists to be one of the most effective ways to stop school spread, has turned deeply personal and political, fueling vitriol at school board meetings that have left board members fearing for their safety. Several Republican-led states have barred school districts from requiring masks, threatening to fine school leaders or cut state funding if they attempt it. Caught in the fray are school leaders, who are forced to again navigate constantly shifting pandemic conditions, conflicting guidance on how to manage them and political fights — all while trying to craft policies that will keep students safe and buildings open. Because despite the deep divide over masks, there is a virtual consensus that it is critical to get children back to face-to-face learning. Advertisement “Politics play into it,” Dan Nerelli, superintendent of the Chichester School District outside Philadelphia, said of the national climate. In his district, masks were optional during the summer and no decision has been made yet on the fall. “People don’t want to say it, but it’s a hot topic, and as superintendents we get caught in the middle of it.” Biden presses federal workers to get vaccinated, with new testing, masking and distancing rules for those who refuse Nearly everyone agrees that children should be back in classrooms, a goal that is now being threatened by the delta variant and the mask debate. Parents in both camps — those who support mask mandates and those who oppose them — are pulling their children from brick-and-mortar schools in districts where they disagree with masking policies. A rash of cases among students and staffers in the Ash Fork School District in Arizona, which opened its doors last week for the new school year, forced the school system to close buildings Wednesday. In a video, Superintendent Seth Staples pleaded with parents for patience. He noted, too, that while masks were recommended, the state barred him from requiring them. Advertisement A spike in coronavirus cases — and a critical shortage of hospital beds — pushed Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson (R) to declare a state of emergency and to call the legislature back in to session to reconsider the state’s ban on mask mandates. On Tuesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidance urging everyone in school buildings to wear masks, regardless of vaccination status, a response to growing concerns over the highly contagious delta variant. That was a shift from guidance issued just three weeks prior, when the agency said only unvaccinated people in school buildings needed masks. CDC changes course on school guidance, advising everyone to wear masks Several school districts, including in New Orleans and Georgia’s Gwinnett County, took heed and will require universal masking in schools for the coming school year. GOP leaders balked. “This is just another example of the Biden-Harris administration’s inability to effectively confront the COVID-19 pandemic,” Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R) said in a statement. Ducey, who banned schools from implementing mask mandates and then helped make it state law, said that requiring masks even for the vaccinated would lead people to wrongly believe that vaccine is not effective. Advertisement The fights over mask mandates and other pandemic adjustments have taken a scary turn in some school districts. Paul Imhoff, who is president of a nationwide association for school superintendents and heads the Upper Arlington school district in Ohio, said some of his colleagues have told him that they have stationed armed security guards outside their homes, worried that rancor will turn into violence. Ducey is one of several GOP governors who have backed efforts to ban or discourage school leaders from implementing mask mandates, saying they want to leave decisions about masking up to parents. Their actions have drawn criticism from those who say they are ignoring public health guidance in order to play to their base of supporters. CDC urges vaccinated people in covid hot spots to resume wearing masks indoors Some opponents of mask mandates rely on fringe science to back their claims that masks are ineffective. Others say that they are concerned masks will leave children traumatized and impede their learning and that the disease poses little threat to children — though they can still spread it to adults. Advertisement And many argue that the public health guidelines infringe on their personal liberty. John Kuhn, superintendent of the small, rural Mineral Wells Independent School District in Texas, said he understands why some parents oppose mask mandates. There are those who oppose any pandemic restrictions and worry they will again lead to a full-scale shutdown, even though public health officials have said the opposite — that mask-wearing could prevent shutdowns. “Will covid-19 spread more readily if government doesn’t require masks? Yes. Is it dangerous? Yes. I don’t think school people are ignorant of these realities or deny them,” Kuhn said. “There are no easy answers here. Basically, a school’s masking policy has to reflect its community’s masking expectations.” In states where mask mandates have been banned, it means local school leaders have to choose between breaking the law or ignoring CDC guidelines. Texas has threatened school leaders with fines if they attempt to implement mask requirements, and in Arizona and South Carolina, schools can lose state funding if they defy the bans. Advertisement In Austin, where Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) issued an executive order banning mask mandates, school leaders are preparing to accommodate children whose parents will not send them to school alongside unmasked students and staffers. The Austin Independent School District recently expanded its virtual offerings, even though the state is not paying for it. “We know that masks work, and kids were great at wearing masks,” said Jason Stanford, spokesman for the school district. “We would absolutely be mandating masks if we were allowed to.” In Florida, where cases of the delta variant are rising sharply, a showdown appears to be looming between Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), a staunch opponent of mask mandates, and at least one school district that this week reversed its fall mask-optional policy, opting to require masks for all. Advertisement “There is no way in good conscience that I could bring anybody back into the school environment, on the bus, the cafeteria, and not have a mask mandate,” said Rosalind Osgood, chair of the Broward County School Board. Opponents of the mask mandate had gathered at the school board meeting Tuesday, burning masks. The board was forced to adjourn early because they refused to wear masks inside the building, CBS4 in Miami reported. On Wednesday, opponents arrived armed with what they said was evidence that masks do not work. One mother lifted her young daughter to the microphone to address the members. “I don’t want to wear it, because I can’t breath,” she said. In Iowa City, parents asked the school district to educate masked and unmasked students separately, since the state barred it from passing a mask mandate. “The parents, rightly so, are trying to find clever ways to work around the laws and still keep their kids safe,” said Shawn Eyestone, president of the school board. “But the problem is, logistically, it’s almost impossible.” Advertisement The debate has also illuminated a stark racial divide in the pandemic. Anti-mask protesters in many places are mostly White. In large urban districts and majority-Black districts, the mask mandates have been largely uncontroversial. It’s a contrast that has been reflected in polls. In May, more than three-quarters of Black, Hispanic and Asian parents said they needed mask requirements to feel safe sending their children back in to classrooms, compared with 53 percent of White parents, according to research done by the Rand Corp. New York, Chicago and Los Angeles never lifted their universal masking requirements. And when Clayton County, Ga., outside Atlanta, decided to expand its mask mandate, school leaders heard little fuss. “Many of our families are front-line workers. [Our community] was hit very hard,” Superintendent Morcease Beasley said. “That has contributed to us here in Clayton County hearing little pushback, because those families have experienced the impact of this pandemic firsthand.”","As new school year looms, debates over mask mandates stir anger and confusion",true
588,282119882302258498031836624049095603395,"Health workers with previous Covid-19 infections had six times the immune response to one dose of the Pfizer jab than those who hadn't had the virus. The researchers said this emphasised the importance of people having their second dose to provide the same ""booster"" effect. Those who have had Covid should still have a second jab, though, to ensure ""longer-lasting"" protection. Giving the previously-infected one dose would not be efficient, experts say. Having two jabs gives the best chance of activating all parts of the immune system and potentially protecting against new variants. The study, funded by the Department of Health and Social Care, was an extension of Public Health England's Siren study of healthcare workers.While a second dose was ""vital"" for long-term cover, the Department of Health and Social Care said the findings showed even a single dose gave strong protection in 99% of the 237 health workers studied. Prof Eleanor Riley, at the University of Edinburgh, said this provided ""considerable reassurance that the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation's somewhat controversial decision to recommend a 12-week interval between Covid-19 vaccine doses is a safe, effective and pragmatic approach to maximising public health given current constraints"". T-cell protection Most studies just look at people's antibody response, but this research also measured participants' T-cells. This harder-to-measure part of our immune system tends to respond to lots of different parts of the virus's ""spike"", making it important for protecting against mutations.The vaccine is designed to help your body recognise the virus if it encounters it in the wild, but as the virus mutates it begins to look subtly different, making it harder for the body to recognise. For people who have not had Covid, the first dose of the vaccine provided protection equivalent to having had the virus. But for people who had had Covid in the past, the first dose gave them six times the T-cell response and almost seven times the antibody response, compared with so-called Covid ""naive"" people who had never been infected. And their antibodies were better at neutralising the virus completely, making it much less likely these individuals would be able to pass the virus on to others. Single dose only? These findings ""inevitably"" lead to debate about ""whether vaccine supplies could be stretched further by offering only a single dose to those known to have been previously infected,"" said Prof Danny Altmann at Imperial College, London. ""For most of the world, including the UK, there may be sufficient diagnostic uncertainty as to who was definitely infected to make this approach hard to implement efficiently."" Prof Susanna Dunachie, one of the study leaders from the University of Oxford, said the team also found that vaccination ""improves the breadth of T-cell responses generated in a previously infected individual"". In other words, even if you've had Covid, the vaccine will make you more likely to maintain protection against new mutations of the virus. ""It's still important that everyone follows NHS guidelines to get two doses of the vaccine, even if you think you may have previously had Covid-19,"" she said. The researchers pitted cells from participants' blood against different variants of the virus in the lab. Vaccinated healthcare workers were less able to fight off variants, particularly the South African strain, than the original strain the vaccine is based on. But this effect was less in people with infection-acquired immunity plus a single dose of the vaccine. This implies a second booster dose could work in the same way, providing better protection against the virus as it mutates - although this is yet to be proven.",Covid: Past infection increases vaccine response six-fold,true

National Records of Scotland (NRS) said the effects had been recorded as the ""underlying cause"" in each of the three deaths, which were before 30 April. More than 2.8 million people had received at least a first dose of the vaccine by that date. Public health expert Prof Linda Bauld said the ""vast, vast majority"" of Covid vaccine side effects were very mild. The professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh told BBC Scotland that serious adverse effects from any vaccine were extremely unusual. ""The vast, vast majority of side effects from the Covid vaccines are very mild. You do have severe cases, but only very rarely,"" she said. ""We have been aware of the rare blood clots that we think are linked to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine... but it's not always possible to say the vaccine caused it. There may be other contributory factors."" 'Best' protection against Covid The Scottish government said it was ""important to be cautious"" when drawing conclusions from associations between vaccinations and deaths. ""All medicines, including vaccinations, can have side effects but serious adverse events and deaths are very rare with Covid vaccines,"" a spokesperson said. ""Over three million first doses of Covid vaccines have been administered in Scotland, and only a very small number of people are thought to have died. However, our thoughts and sympathies are always with those few affected, and their families."" The spokesperson added that vaccines remained the ""best way"" to protect people from Covid-19 and had already saved thousands of lives. Three Covid-19 vaccines - Pfizer/BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca and Moderna - are currently being used in the UK. All have been authorised for supply by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). The vaccines are known to cause a number of mild side effects like a sore arm or headache. In April, the MHPRA confirmed that seven people had died from unusual blood clots after getting the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in the UK, but it was not clear if this was a coincidence or side effect from the vaccine. In total, 30 people out of 18 million vaccinated in the UK by 24 March had these clots and the regulator said the benefits of the vaccine continued to outweigh the risks.The latest monthly figures from the NRS reported that 10,109 deaths have been registered where Covid was mentioned on the death certificate. Six deaths were registered between 10 May and 16 May, a decrease of one death from the previous week. The figures also show that post Covid-19 conditions - including ""long Covid"" - were mentioned on 11 death certificates in the period from March 2020 to April 2021. Pete Whitehouse, the NRS director of statistical services, said: ""Last week there were no registered Covid-19 deaths in 29 of Scotland's 32 council areas. Across Scotland, six Covid-19 deaths were registered which is the lowest number since early September last year. ""The report also shows that deaths from Covid-19 continues to have a greater impact on people living in Scotland's more deprived communities. ""Over the course of the pandemic, people living in these most deprived areas are 2.4 times as likely to die with Covid-19 than those living in the least deprived areas after adjusting for age."" In the week up to 16 May, one Covid death was of someone aged 75 or over, while the other five deaths were of people aged under 65. Four deaths occurred in hospitals, one death occurred in a care home, and one was in a home or other non-institutional setting.",Covid: Three deaths in Scotland linked to vaccine,true

Scotland's new education secretary has made a ""cast-iron guarantee"" that no young person will be further disadvantaged by this year's assessments. Shirley-Anne Somerville promised pupils ""If your teacher thinks you deserve an A, you will get an A"". She said she still had full confidence in the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA). But she said lessons had to be learned from the Covid experience. Asked by the BBC if she could give a cast-iron guarantee that the situation pupils faced last year - when grades were subject to an algorithm and were weighted by a school's past performance or postcode - would not happen again, she said: ""Absolutely"".She said: ""This year a teacher's judgement is based on an individual's demonstrated attainment. So if your teacher thinks you deserve an A, you will get an A. ""The assessment process is judged by your teacher and they will submit the grade. No-one is coming in to overrule that or second guess it. Your teacher will decide your grade, if you don't agree you have direct right of free appeal. No-one is coming in to second guess them or their teacher."" Two weeks from the end of a second turbulent school year, teachers, pupils and parents remain wary of qualification arrangements.No formal exams have taken place since 2019 and after a disastrous 2020 results day, all eyes are on the 2021 solution. The replacement has again drawn criticism for its numerous assessments and an unpopular appeals process. Last week, Ms Somerville announced a reform of the SQA and Education Scotland, just hours after Nicola Sturgeon gave the SQA her full confidence. ""We do have full confidence in the SQA,"" she said. ""But we also know that we need to learn lessons from the experience of Covid and also with the report coming up from the OECD, we, as a government, need to be open to reform, open to challenge and to suggestions of how we should change. ""The qualifications the SQA are delivering this year for young people are sound and they are credible, but that doesn't mean we should stop and we can't and shouldn't look at change and that's what we are determined to deliver."" Shirley-Anne Somerville announced reform of the SQA and Education Scotland in parliament last week Just one month into her new post, the new cabinet secretary said she had seen the anticipated international OECD report into the entire Scottish education system. Ahead of its publication this month, she said the Scottish government was ""open to reform"". Open to change ""It is very important that we demonstrate a direction of travel for the government and demonstrate an openness for change,"" she said. ""We know this big report is coming, we know the OECD has looked at education in the round and if the OECD is recommending change to us I think its quite right that early on in my time as education secretary say I am open to that change, I am open to that challenge, so is the whole of the Scottish government. ""That gives people at least a little time before that OECD report is published to take part in that conversation, have a think about what they want - because I hear a lot of people saying we should scrap the SQA or make dramatic changes but what I don't often hear is a solution to what can be replacements or what people want to change."" Rosshall Secondary School IMAGE SOURCE,GETTY IMAGES Looking ahead to the new school year in August, the education secretary said she would like to see schools return to normal, but that contingency arrangements were in place if schools needed to move to a different way of working. She gave parents and pupils reassurance that plans had been made. However, she said decisions had not yet been taken over next year's exams. Analysis box by Lucy Whyte, BBC Scotland education correspondent It's certainly planting her flag firmly in the ground. Given the outcry that there was last year and the criticism about how things have been working this year, Shirley-Anne Somerville obviously doesn't expect to be in the same position her predecessor John Swinney was in last year when he had to make that U-turn on results. She mentioned the OECD report a few times, particularly when talking about her decision to reform the SQA and Education Scotland, so that potentially hints that the report might include something about that. Presentational grey line Coming into the new role, Ms Somerville said she believed the government had a very good record on education and that she was seeing progress in closing the attainment gap, and that empowerment in schools was making a difference. But she admitted there was more to do. She said: ""When you look at context of Covid and reports coming out, the OECD, we know we can do more. ""We know we still have work to do, and Covid accentuated the need even more."" In response, Oliver Mundell, the Scottish Conservatives education spokesman, said he wanted to see the government to go further than reform. ""Rather than reforming the SQA I think they should be talking about axing it, scrapping it and starting from the beginning again, asking what kind of qualifications body do we want in Scotland, not shifting existing people around, and tinkering around the edges.

Witnesses said they saw soldiers on board the truck, which was parked outside an office of the military proxy Union Solidarity and Development Party, before the explosion. The blast occurred within walking distance of the township’s police station. The blast at around 3:25 p.m. rocked the whole neighborhood. Local people saw a plume of black smoke snaking up toward the sky while the vehicle was completely engulfed in flames. Gunfire-like sounds could be heard for a few minutes, apparently from exploding ammunition on board the truck. Casualties had yet to be confirmed as the area was sealed off by security forces following the explosion. However, photos of blown-up body parts including hands lying on the road were circulated on Facebook. Since last month, Yangon has seen periodic attacks against regime targets. Local administrators have been shot dead at close range on the streets, and sporadic bombings have been reported. However, Friday’s attack in Tamwe is unprecedented in its scale.

The shocking poll comes after President Biden continues to fail the American people and the world. Respondents of the poll were asked, “Do you think Joe Biden has the mental soundness to serve effectively as president, or not?” Check out what Breitbart reported: While 49 percent said yes, 48 percent said no. When respondents were asked weeks before, between September 7-10, 49 percent said yes, and only 45 percent said no, handing Biden three more points of less confidence in his mental soundness on Sunday. On the question asking if respondents believe “Joe Biden is a strong leader, or not?” only 45 percent said yes, down four points from October of 2020. Fifty-three percent said Biden is not a strong leader, up eight points since October 2020. The poll also asked, “Do you think the country has become more or less united since Joe Biden took office?” Fifty-four percent of the country is less united, while 37 percent said the country is more united since Biden took office.The poor polling numbers on Biden’s mental soundness come as the Foreign Relations Committee’s ranking member, Sen. James Risch (R-ID), on September 14 questioned who is in charge of the Biden-Harris administration. “There’s real questions right now as to who’s making the decisions,” he questioned State Department Secretary Antony Blinken.
Former White House physician for former president’s Barack Obama and Donald Trump, Ronny Jackson has been sounding the alarm in recent months over President Biden’s declining mental state. During an interview with Fox News in July, Jackson predicted that President Joe Biden will be forced to resign or will be faced with the 25th Amendment before he is voted out of office. “And I’ve been saying that it’s only going to get worse, and guess what? We’re watching that happen right before our eyes right now,” Jackson said. “And I’m at the point right now where, you know, I went from, you know, telling people, we should be concerned about what might potentially be going on, to now saying, hey, what is happening right now?” “Where are the people in our academic medicine that were out there calling for President Trump to have a cognitive test? Where are these people?” Jackson added. “There’s something seriously going on with this man right now. And you know, I think that he’s either gonna, he’s either gonna resign, they’re going to convince him to resign from office at some point in the near future for medical issues, or they’re going to have to use the 25th Amendment to get rid of this man right now. There’s some serious stuff going on right now.” Jackson went on to state that “this is a national security issue at this point … it really is.” He later followed up on Twitter with a clip of his segment, noting: “Something’s SERIOUSLY wrong with Biden – and it’s only going to get WORSE! It’s past the point of embarrassment. He’s lost. He’s confused. He can barely put a coherent sentence together.

Berger on Monday rebuked Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin’s edict requiring all Armed Forces personnel to submit to Covid-19 vaccinations under threat of court martial or discharge, said a source in Gen. Berger’s office who overheard a heated conversation between them. Gen. Berger telephoned the defense secretary minutes after he said in a press conference that the Covid-19 vaccination is needed to maintain military readiness and that he would enforce the mandatary vaccination policy regardless of FDA approval status. “There will be no mandatory vaccinations for my Marines,” Gen. Berger said. In a transcript of the call reviewed by Real Raw News, Gen. Berger lambasted Austin and branded him a traitor. “Under no circumstances will Marines be compelled to take a potentially hazardous vaccination that the FDA won’t even fully endorse,” Gen. Berger told Austin. “You are a coward and a traitor, manipulated by people pushing bad policy on the men and women who provide security to our nation. Neither you nor your puppet president has authority to enforce such a policy.” Austin argued that mandatory vaccinations have always been a requirement for soldiers enlisting into the Armed Forces, and they, as property of the U.S. government, have no right to decide whether to take the Covid-19 jab. The federal government and President Biden would decide for them, Austin said. “They’re incapable of making informed decisions. So we, their leaders, make the big decisions they cannot,” Austin said. “Biden and Harris are in charge, not individual soldiers.” Then Austin got political: “If conservatives and evangelicals see our fighting forces getting vaccinated, they’ll be more likely to get vaccinated themselves,” Austin said. Gen. Berger said it was unfair to compare established vaccinations with a product that was rushed to market with little concern for side effects. He called the CDC and Dr. Fauci corrupt, and he asked Austin why the puppet administration hid from the public an NIH report linking the vaccination to thousands of fatalities. “If someone dies, you say it was Covid-19. There’s a refusal to admit the vaccination carries side effects that can include death in certain individuals.” “I’m not a physician. I’m the Secretary of Defense for Joseph R. Biden, and I follow orders,” Austin retorted. “In case you haven’t heard, Biden’s not in charge of the military, and neither are you. You can sell whatever lies you want to the media. You sold your soul, Lloyd, and I hope you can live with yourself,” Gen. Berger said. Gen. Berger said he had the support of other Joint Chiefs of Staff and would implore them to ignore unlawful orders coming from the illegitimate administration. “If a soldier wants the vaccination, fine. If not, he’s not rolling up his sleeve. If you try to forcibly vaccinate even one of my Marines, you better come armed,” Gen. Berger said, and hung up the phone.

Hart, who is Kanievsky’s personal doctor, noted the recent rise in COVID-19 infections particularly among unvaccinated children and youths, a phenomenon which has arisen after the entry of the Delta variant into the country, and said that this is a life-endangering and threatened once again to shut down educational institutions. “We brought all the medical opinions to Rabbi Kanievsky and Rabbi Edelstein,” wrote Hart.

Australia had previously agreed to buy 51 million doses of the vaccine being developed by Australian firm CSL and the University of Queensland (UQ). The government said orders of other vaccines would now fill the shortfall. CSL and UQ stressed that the positive results were false - meaning trial participants' health was not at risk. The Australian government said it had now entered an agreement for the Novavax vaccine, and upped its existing order of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. The UK was the first to begin rolling out a vaccine from Pfizer this week.What happened with the UQ/CSL vaccine? The vaccine had been in stage one of trials, and proving to be effective in making antibodies. But it also generated HIV antibodies in some recipients - which meant it showed false positives for HIV. Further testing proved the HIV wasn't there. CSL and UQ said fixing the flaw would take about a year, prompting a decision to abandon the trial. ""It was likely to work. But we knew that we didn't want to have any issues with confidence, and this false-positive test may have caused some confusion and lack of confidence,"" said Brendan Murphy, secretary of Australia's Department of Health.Vaccine co-lead Paul Young described the decision as ""devastating"" after 11 months of ""living and breathing this project"". ""While this is a tough decision to take, the urgent need for a vaccine has to be everyone's priority,"" he said. Other medical experts have also praised the ""realistic"" decision to abandon the UQ vaccine, saying it reflects the reality of vaccine development. ""In general, about 90% of vaccines never make it to market. As a global community, we have been spoilt with the unprecedented swiftness and success with which the development of Covid-19 vaccines have taken place,"" said infectious diseases expert Sanjaya Senanayake from the Australian National University. What does it mean for Australia? Australia has all but eliminated community transmission of the virus, after getting on top of outbreaks in recent months. Prof Murphy said the nation was in a ""wonderful position"" at present, but there would be ""full population coverage"" from two vaccines in 2021. ""We don't need emergency approval - we're in a good position because we've controlled the virus,"" he said on Friday. ""So I'm very confident about the successful vaccination strategy that we'll be facing next year."" The government said it had prepared for this sort of situation and as such had ""spread the risk"" with multiple deals for vaccines. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said focusing Australia's manufacturing efforts on the other vaccines would mean ""we are more likely to have the entire population vaccinated earlier rather than later"". The Oxford vaccine has been found to be ""safe and effective"", according to researchers, but is awaiting approval from regulators around the world. Early 2021 is still listed as when the first vaccines - most likely from Oxford/AstraZeneca - are scheduled to be given to Australians. Australia has a population of 25 million people. It recorded just one case of local transmission in the past week. The nation has reported 908 deaths and 28,000 cases so far during the pandemic - far fewer than many nations. It has been praised for responding quickly to the pandemic with border shutdowns, lockdown measures and aggressive contract-tracing efforts. Some failures, however, have been blamed for deaths.

And because this nonsense is about a pandemic disease, and policy makers do sometimes base their decisions on trash analyses published online, I felt like it’s important to address this inaccuracy as soon as possible. Which brings us here, to the claim: that 90% of all positive COVID-19 tests are false positives. This has serious implications, the story goes, because it means that there are actually virtually no cases of the disease in the country, and the government is lying to us all*. Which is, to be blunt, totally wrong. “I dropped a steaming pile of that idea on the paddock just this afternoon” Source: Pexels Let me explain. Testing For COVID-19 The main test used to determine if someone has been infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is called a polymerase chain reaction test or a PCR. PCR testing basically takes tiny amounts of viral DNA or RNA and amplifies it until you can detect it easily in a sample, and is one of the main ways we test for specific infections. PCR testing has a number of advantages, as well as some weaknesses. The test has a problem with identifying people who are in the early stages of infection. This is because it can be hard to get enough virus on a swab to replicate it in the test, which means that people who have only been infected 1 or 2 days ago may not be positive when they are tested. In fact, the sensitivity of the test can be as low as 40% in people who have only been infected a few days, meaning that 60% of tests are false negatives in this population. This is why many places will retest you if you are still having symptoms after a few days, even if your initial test was negative. Pictured: Somewhat less than ideal. Source: Pexels But in this blog, we’re not focusing on false negatives, we’re worried about false positives, because a few people having their COVID-19 missed is only worrisome if we care about public health rather than strange conspiracies. So, false positives. With the PCR tests used to detect COVID-19, the average number of false positives has been extremely well-calculated. We have been using these tests for decades, after all, and we’ve had the better part of a year to perfect them for this specific disease. While there were some early validations that showed slightly higher numbers of false positives, we’ve now got enormous samples run by researchers from across the world that show the rate of false positives in PCR tests for COVID-19 to be around 1 in 1,000 or lower. In other words, it is incredibly rare for a COVID-19 test that comes back positive to be a false positive. Almost unheard of. It happens, but very rarely, particularly because many tests are confirmed, i.e. run twice. Pictured: Very common these days. Source: Pexels Nonsense Numbers We can actually use two numbers, called specificity and sensitivity, to see the exact rate of tests that are ‘right’ in a population. The specificity of COVID-19 PCR tests is the ratio of true negatives to false positives+true negatives, which works out to about 99.9%. In other words, for every 1,000 people you test who truly don’t have the disease, you get 1 test that is falsely positive. Sensitivity is the ratio of true positives to false negatives+true positives, and while this is also high it’s not quite as high as specificity, averaging out around 98% or thereabouts. This means that for every 1,000 people you test who do have a coronavirus infection, you’ll miss about 20 true cases. Let’s imagine a population where about 50 in 1,000 people actually have COVID-19. You test all of them with PCR tests. Of the 950 people without the disease, you’ll get an average of one false positive test. Of the 50 people who do in fact have the disease, you’ll miss 1 person, which means 49 true positives. In this case, 98% of all positives are true positives, with just 1/49 tests being a false positive. You’ll also have missed one true positive, so your estimated prevalence — the proportion of people who you think have COVID-19 — is actually correct at 50/1,000. Pictured: According to stock photo websites, all science is test tubes or astronomy Source: Pexels Even with very low numbers of infections, the spectacularly high specificity of PCR tests means that you almost never have more false positives than true positives. If we repeat the calculation for a situation where only 50 in 10,000 people have COVID-19 in our sample, we still find 49 true positives and 10 false positives, which means our ‘correct’ percentage is now 83% — still very high, given the low population prevalence in the people we’re testing. In real life, it’s rare that so few of the people we test actually have the disease, because we target testing at those with symptoms and who think that they might be getting sick. And we can see this incredible accuracy happening in real life. In Australia, despite hundreds of thousands of tests conducted every week, there are vanishingly few positive results. In New South Wales, the state that I live in, we conduct more than 115,000 tests every week with <40 positive results. Even if every one of those were a false positive, the false positive rate would still be less than a fraction of 0.1%. More broadly, it is simply wrong to suggest that most tests coming back positive for COVID-19 are false positives. In reality, the simple truth is that most positive tests are just that: positive. The number of people who are sick with COVID-19 is increasing in many places in the world — particularly the UK — despite what certain inaccurate blogs might have you believe. This is the sad truth, and nothing more.",Most Positive Coronavirus Tests Are True Positives,true
598,320379293428473938059843851069792859936,"This report summarises the condition of coral reefs of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) from the Long-Term Monitoring Program (LTMP) surveys of 127 reefs conducted between August 2020 and April 2021 (reported as ‘2021’). Over the 35 years of monitoring by AIMS, the reefs of the GBR have shown an ability to recover after disturbances. In 2021, widespread recovery was underway, largely due to increases in fast growing Acropora corals. Survey reefs experienced low levels of acute stressors over the past 12 months with no prolonged high temperatures or major cyclones. Numbers of outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish on survey reefs have generally decreased; however, there remain ongoing outbreaks on some reefs in the Southern GBR. Overall, 59 out of 127 reefs had moderate (>10% - 30%) hard coral cover and 36 reefs had high (>30% - 50%) hard coral cover. On the Northern GBR, region-wide hard coral cover was moderate and had continued to increase to 27% from the most recent low point in 2017. On the Central GBR region-wide hard coral cover was moderate and had increased to 26% in 2021. Region-wide hard coral cover on reefs in the Southern GBR was high and had increased to 39% in 2021. In 2020, most of the surveyed reefs experienced heat stress accumulation that produced widespread coral bleaching but was below thresholds where widespread mortality is expected to occur. Consistent with this, surveys in 2021 recorded low coral mortality from the 2020 bleaching event. In periods free from acute disturbances, most GBR coral reefs demonstrate resilience through the ability to begin recovery. However, the reefs of the GBR continue to be exposed to cumulative stressors, and the prognosis for the future disturbance regime is one of increased and longer lasting marine heatwaves and a greater proportion of severe tropical cyclones.

Reefs are defined as Recovering when they were previously classified with an Incipient or Active Outbreak, but currently have COTS numbers below outbreak thresholds. d) The coral bleaching severity is reported as the percent of live coral colonies bleached at the time of survey per region: Northern GBR (October/November/December 2020), Central GBR (January/February and April 2021) and Southern GBR (August 2020). Background With reef surveys extending over 35 years, the AIMS Long-Term Monitoring Program (LTMP) provides an invaluable record of change by repeatedly surveying coral reef communities over a large area of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). This annual update of the state and trends in hard coral cover across the entire GBR is based on manta tow surveys of coral reefs, mainly on the mid- and outer shelf (Figure 1). A total of 127 reefs were surveyed from August 2020 to April 2021 (reported as ‘2021’). Detailed reports on the state and trends of reefs by latitudinal sectors and of individual reefs, including their disturbance history, and are available shortly after the completion of each survey trip. Data summaries are available for download. The dynamic nature of GBR coral reefs and the considerable variation among regions in the rates of decline and recovery of hard coral cover in response to disturbances are clear in the long-term record. Understanding the dynamics of the disturbance regime provides a critical context for the interpretation of the long-term monitoring data. For annual updates, the GBR Marine Park is divided into three regions (Figure 1), with each showing different trajectories of change in hard coral cover over time, mostly in response to the cumulative impacts of the main disturbances affecting the surveyed reefs, e.g., severe tropical cyclones, outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish and coral bleaching. The LTMP provides the longest running, most spatially extensive dataset collected by standard methods on the GBR (see Box 1). Due to logistical and cost constraints, the numbers of reefs surveyed each year are small compared to the number of reefs found on the GBR (~100 vs 3000). However, the LTMP survey reefs provide a representative sample across the length and breadth of the GBR that captures several geographical and ecological gradients (e.g., latitude, position across the continental shelf) and encapsulates many of the bioregions and all the management zones defined in the 2004 rezoning of the Marine Park. AIMS is committed to continual improvement in the analyses of LTMP data, and recent statistical advances have permitted a refinement of analytical approaches used to analyse the type of ecological time series data used in this report. This year we have examined the effectiveness of several approaches and present an ensemble of various statistical models with a justification for the choice of the model selected in this report (see Box 2). Figure 2: Status of the 127 reefs surveyed in the Northern, Central and Southern GBR in 2021. Data are the number of reefs with average hard coral cover falling within low, moderate, high and very high coral cover categories. RESULTS - Condition Summary to April 2021 Northern Great Barrier Reef (Surveyed October to December 2020) There was substantial variation in the condition of individual reefs in the Northern GBR (Figures 1 and 2, Image 1). Seven of 54 reefs surveyed had low coral cover (>0% - 10%), 29 reefs had moderate coral cover (>10% - 30%), 14 reefs had high (>30% - 50%) and four had very high coral cover (>50% - 75%) (Figures 1 and 2). Recovery was underway on the majority of Northern GBR reefs following a period of cumulative disturbances stretching from 2014 to 2020. Of the 32 reefs previously surveyed in the last two years, only six had decreased in hard coral cover (Figure 1), indicating there was minimal mortality from the 2020 mass coral bleaching event at these survey reefs. The impacts of this event are discussed in more detail further below. Region-wide hard coral cover continued to increase from the lowest levels recorded by the LTMP in 2017 to 27% in 2021 (Figure 3). Surveys in 2021 found little evidence of crown-of-thorns starfish activity in the region, most reefs were classified as No COTS and No Outbreak and only one reef classified as Incipient Outbreak (Figure 1). In 2021, surveys were conducted prior to peak summer temperatures. During surveys, 15 of 54 Northern GBR reefs had low-level bleaching (<10% of corals bleached), with no bleaching recorded on the remainder. This indicates there was some accumulation of thermal stress in 2021. Figure 3: Trends in average hard coral cover (blue line) for the Northern GBR based on manta tow surveys. Survey data from 129 reefs contributed to the 35-year time series; blue shading represents 95% confidence intervals. 54 reefs were surveyed in 2021. Note that many reefs in this region do not have a regular survey history, and in recent years fewer inshore reefs were surveyed due to the risk of crocodile encounters. Image 1: Photos showing the variable state of reefs in the Northern GBR in 2021. Some reefs had yet to recover from a series of recent disturbances with low hard coral cover and dead standing skeletons covered in turf algae, mostly on mid-shelf reefs such as A. Monsoon Reef and B. Reef 11-049. Other mid-shelf reefs had high numbers of Acropora corals, such as C. Forrester Reef near Cooktown and D. Macgillivray Reef near Lizard Island. Outer shelf coral assemblages had moderate to high levels of hard coral cover such as e) Reef 14-075 and f) Ribbon Reef No. 1.  More information on individual survey reefs can be found here. Central Great Barrier Reef (Surveyed January to April 2021) Since regular surveys by AIMS began in 1985, hard coral cover on reefs in the Central GBR has generally been lower than in the Northern and Southern GBR. Region-wide hard coral cover in the Central GBR decreased to the lowest level in LTMP records in 2012, following the impact of Severe Tropical Cyclone Yasi in 2011 (Figure 4). Hard coral cover then recovered rapidly to the highest average regional cover in the LTMP database record in 2016 (29%). From 2016 to 2019, hard coral cover decreased continuously to 14% (Figure 4), largely due to repeated mass coral bleaching in 2016 and 2017 and outbreaks of crown‐of‐thorns starfish. In 2021, hard coral cover had increased again to 26% (Figure 4). The status of the reefs in the Central GBR was variable in 2021; 32 of the 53 reefs surveyed had low or moderate hard coral cover (<30%) while 21 reefs had coral cover higher than 30% (Figures 1 and 2, Image 2). None of the surveyed reefs had hard coral cover higher than 75% (Figure 2). A total of 30 of the 53 Central GBR reefs surveyed in 2021 had been previously surveyed within the last two years. Hard coral cover had declined on only two reefs while increasing on most of them (28 reefs; Figure 1). Many reefs offshore from Cairns, Innisfail, and Townsville have had outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish in recent years. However, there were no Incipient or Active Outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish recorded on Central GBR reefs in 2021 (Figure 1). The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority’s Crown-of-thorns Starfish Control Program has been actively removing substantial numbers of starfish in this area, which would have contributed to the low numbers of crown-of-thorns starfish recorded during these surveys. Coral bleaching was widespread in the Central GBR during the last surveys in 2020, although the severity varied among reefs. The impacts of this event are discussed in more detail further below. Central GBR reefs surveyed in 2021 had low-level bleaching (<10% of corals bleached), indicating there was some accumulation of thermal stress. No bleaching levels higher than this were recorded. Figure 4: Trends in average hard coral cover (blue line) for the Central GBR based on manta tow surveys up. Survey data from 226 reefs contributed to the 35-year time series; blue shading represents 95% confidence intervals. 53 reefs were surveyed in 2021. Image 2: Some Central GBR reefs had very high coral cover like, A. Rebe Reef offshore from the Whitsundays. B. Parts of John Brewer Reef have been protected from crown-of-thorns starfish impacts by the COTS Control Program. C. Numbers of COTS have declined in the Central GBR and very few COTS were recorded in 2021, although some reefs, like D. Rib Reef were badly affected by COTS in previous years and currently have very low coral cover.  More information on individual survey reefs can be found here. Southern Great Barrier Reef (Surveyed August 2020) The Southern GBR has generally had higher coral cover than the Northern or Central GBR, but it has also been the most dynamic over the 35-year survey history. Large declines in hard coral cover followed Severe Tropical Cyclone Hamish in 2009, which reduced coral cover to the lowest levels recorded by the LTMP in 2011 (Figure 5). A large increase in hard coral cover occurred from 2011 to 2016, reaching 37% in 2017. However, outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish began in 2018 and regional coral cover decreased to 29% in 2019. In 2021 coral cover has increased again to 39% (Figure 5). The state of individual Southern GBR reefs was variable (Image 3) however, there was a greater proportion of reefs with high coral cover than low or moderate coral cover, a contrast to the Northern and Central GBR where the majority of reefs had coral cover in the two lowest categories (Figures 1 and 2). Of the 20 reefs surveyed in 2021, 19 reefs have been surveyed in the last two years. Hard coral cover decreased on four of these, whereas 15 reefs increased in hard coral cover (Figure 1). In 2016 and 2017, reefs in the Southern GBR were not exposed to the extreme sea surface temperatures that led to the mass coral bleaching on the Central and Northern GBR. However, in the austral summer of 2020, waters of the Southern GBR warmed substantially. Aerial surveys by the ARC Centre of Excellence in Coral Reef Studies revealed widespread severe bleaching across much of the Southern GBR. However, only two reefs accumulated degree-heating weeks[1] (DHW) values in 2020 that were above the level at which mortality would have been expected. The impacts of this event are discussed in more detail further below. In 2021, there was widespread low-level bleaching (<10% of colonies)of sensitive species during surveys, however no instances of more severe bleaching were observed. The Southern GBR was the epicentre of crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks in 2021, with three of the 20 reefs classified as having Active Outbreaks and one reef with an Incipient Outbreak (Figure 1). Low numbers of crown-of-thorns starfish were recorded on three reefs classified as Recovering or No Outbreak. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority’s Crown-of-thorns Starfish Control Program has been actively removing substantial numbers of starfish in this area. 1Degree Heating Weeks (DHW) shows the accumulated heat stress over the previous three months by adding up the time when temperature exceeds the bleaching threshold. Significant coral bleaching is predicted above 4 DHW and coral mortality is expected above 8 DHW. Further information available from NOAA. Figure 5: Trends in average hard coral cover (blue line) for the Southern GBR based on manta tow surveys. Survey data from 137 reefs contributed to the 35-year time series; blue shading represents 95% confidence intervals. 20 reefs were surveyed in 2021. Image 3: Many reefs in the Southern GBR still have high coral cover such as A. Snake Reef in the Swain sector and B. Boult Reef in the Capricorn-Bunkers. However, C. surveys of agents of coral mortality revealed D. outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish continue to decimate coral populations on many reefs in the Swain sector. Such outbreaks leave very low coral cover as seen at E. Chinaman Reef, F. Horseshoe Reef, where crown-of-thorns outbreaks have run their course. More information on individual survey reefs can be found here. Models BOX 2: How the data were analysed The impact of the 2020 mass coral bleaching event In the austral summer of 2020, the Great Barrier Reef was subjected to accumulated heat stress to the level at which mass coral bleaching occurred across much of the GBR. This included the Southern GBR which had escaped bleaching in the 2016 and 2017 events. The third such event in five years is a sign that the Great Barrier Reef is already experiencing the consequences of climate change. Aerial surveys undertaken by the Centre of Excellence in Coral Reef Studies in 2020 revealed extensive mass coral bleaching on the Southern GBR for the first time, as well as widespread bleaching in the Central and Northern GBR. Of the reefs surveyed by the LTMP using manta tow in 2021, 81 were surveyed within the last two years allowing an appraisal of the impacts of the 2020 mass coral bleaching. Only twelve reefs had decreased in hard coral cover. Decreases in coral cover on most of these twelve reefs were most likely associated with heat stress during the 2020 mass bleaching event, as there were few other acute pressures. However, three of these reefs also had crown-of-thorns starfish at densities expected to cause coral mortality and their coral cover declines cannot be attributed solely to coral bleaching. These results indicate minor impacts on coral cover on the LTMP survey reefs from the 2020 mass coral bleaching event. However, it is important to place these results into the context of the accumulated heat stress experienced by survey reefs during the 2020 event, recorded as degree-heating weeks (DHW). Accumulated heat stress was variable across the GBR in 2020 (Figure 6). DHW information was available for 126 out of 127 reefs surveyed in 2021. Of these, 101 reefs experienced heat stress during 2020 that was greater than the threshold at which widespread mass coral bleaching is expected (4 DHW; Figure 6). This agrees with the observations from aerial surveys of widespread bleaching across the Great Barrier Reef. However, only 15 survey reefs experienced heat stress above the levels at which mortality from coral bleaching is expected (8 DHW; Figure 6). This agrees well with the LTMP observations that most reefs surveyed by the LTMP in 2021 appear to have undergone minimal coral mortality following the 2020 bleaching event. Heat stress accumulation between 4 and 8 DHW can cause some mortality but is more likely to produce sub-lethal effects like reduced growth, reproductive output and larval settlement. These sub-lethal effects can have long-lasting impacts on the recovery dynamics of coral reefs; however, the full extent of these impacts is poorly understood and will only become evident in the future. Figure 6: Exposure level of the 127 LTMP reefs surveyed in 2021 to accumulated heat stress during the austral summer of 2020. Widespread bleaching is expected above 4 DHW, while coral mortality is predicted above 8 DHW. Source: NOAA/NESDIS/STAR Coral Reef Watch program The LTMP surveys a representative but small proportion of GBR reefs and there are reefs not surveyed that experienced high levels of accumulated heat stress above thresholds at which we would expect to see coral mortality. This year has seen recovery underway on LTMP survey reefs across much of the GBR. However, the metric hard coral cover, while being a simple and robust measure of reef condition, reveals nothing about the diversity or composition of coral assemblages. To assess this, the LTMP also quantifies the percent cover of different coral types using digital imagery along permanently marked transects during fixed site surveys, at a smaller subset of reefs across the length and breadth of the GBR. The majority of recovery was driven by increases in the fast-growing Acropora corals, which have proliferated across many GBR reefs. Once established, these corals enter an exponential growth phase which rapidly increases measures of percent hard coral cover, as documented in this year’s results. However, the fast growth comes at a cost, the skeleton is less dense than other slower growing corals, making them particularly susceptible to wave damage, like that generated by strong winds and tropical cyclones. They are also highly susceptible to coral bleaching and are the preferred prey for crown-of-thorns starfish. This means that large increases in hard coral cover can quickly be negated by disturbances on reefs where Acropora predominate. Preliminary analyses have also revealed a shift in the community composition of coral assemblages on some outer shelf reefs in the Northern and Central GBR, where the impacts of the 2016 and 2017 bleaching were greatest. While there have been increases in hard coral cover in these areas, there has been a shift to coral assemblages dominated by Pocillopora corals (Image 4) rather than the typically dominant Acropora corals. This shift to Pocillopora-dominated reefs likely results from different mechanisms on different reefs and may include: Adult Pocillopora have survived bleaching where other corals have died, and, Surviving Pocillopora can produce more offspring after bleaching as they are more numerous and spawn more frequently than other corals like Acropora Image 4: Coral community changes at Yonge Reef in the Northern region of the GBR from A. 2001 when Acropora corals were abundant to B. 2021 when Pocillopora corals were emerging as the dominant coral species. The replacement of Acropora corals by Pocillopora has important ramifications. For example, slower growth of Pocillopora will likely result in decreased speed of recovery. Additionally, impacts to other animals, like fishes, which are dependent on Acropora corals for food and shelter, may become apparent due to the reduced habitat complexity of a Pocillopora-dominated reef. AIMS will continue to monitor these reefs to determine whether Pocillopora continues to dominate, how that will affect other parts of the reef ecosystem, as well as conduct more detailed analyses of the longer-term effects of bleaching and other disturbances on the trajectory of coral reef status. Assessing the long-term health of the Great Barrier Reef Determining the status of the GBR requires robust long-term datasets collected using standard methods. Long-term data are particularly important to avoid the “shifting baseline” syndrome, as the results each year are always considered in the context of the long-term trends. The last couple of years have revealed that recovery is underway across much of the GBR, a promising sign illustrating that the GBR still has the capacity and necessary ecological functions to recover from disturbances. The Central and Southern GBR had periods of recovery within the last decade which have been curtailed by disturbances, arresting recovery, and causing further coral declines. Sustained recovery of the GBR back to historical high coral cover requires the next few years to be disturbance free to allow corals to continue to grow and increase their populations. While there have been hard coral cover increases across all three regions over recent years, the Northern and Southern GBR are still below the highest recorded coral cover in the 1980s, and preliminary analyses have documented shifts in the dominant corals on some reefs. 2021 has been a low disturbance year, while the period from 2014 to 2020 was an intense period of widespread disturbances. There were numerous severe tropical cyclones and three mass coral bleaching events in five years. The fourth wave of crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks began around 2010 between Lizard Island and Cairns, and by 2020 had progressed south to reefs offshore from Townsville. The prognosis for the future disturbance regime under climate change is one of increasingly frequent and longer lasting marine heatwaves and a greater proportion of severe tropical cyclones. Mitigation of these climatic threats requires immediate global action on climate change. Crown-of-thorns starfish as coral predators are a major cyclic disturbance on the GBR and when left unchecked, outbreaks can decimate coral populations. However, it is one of the few threats to the GBR that can be directly managed locally. The Crown-of-thorns Control Program has been active on the GBR during the current outbreak and seeks to reduce starfish numbers at key reefs to reduce the amount of coral lost and to diminish the brood stock which propagates the outbreak ‘wave’ southward through most of the GBR. In 2021, the number of Active Outbreaks has decreased from previous years, although outbreaks were still recorded in the Swain sector of the Southern GBR. The LTMP aims to assist analyses of the effectiveness of the Crown-of-thorns Control Program in the next few years. The predicted consequences of climate change, which include more frequent and intense mass coral bleaching events, are now a contemporary reality. Simultaneously, chronic stressors such as high turbidity, increasing ocean temperatures and changing ocean chemistry can all negatively affect recovery rates, while more frequent acute disturbances mean that the intervals for recovery are becoming shorter. Measuring and understanding the process of, and limitations to, coral reef recovery will be a continued focus of AIMS’ research and monitoring over the next years.",Long-Term Monitoring Program Annual Summary Report of Coral Reef Condition 2020/2021,true

The continent, which has a population of more than one billion, has had about 1.5 million cases, according to data compiled by the John Hopkins University. These figures are far lower than those in Europe, Asia or the Americas, with reported cases continuing to decline. Africa has recorded about 37,000 deaths, compared with roughly 580,000 in the Americas, 230,000 in Europe, and 205,000 in Asia. ""The case-fatality ratio (CFR) for Covid-19 in Africa is lower than the global CFR, suggesting the outcomes have been less severe among African populations,"" noted a recent continental study by Partnership for Evidence-based Response to Covid-19 (PERC), which brings together a number of private and public organisations. Low testing rates continue to undermine the continental response however, there is no indication that a large number of Covid-19 deaths have been missed, said Dr John Nkengasong, the head of Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC). So what are some of the reasons for Africa's relatively low death rate? 1: Quick action Worshippers wearing facemask sings as worship centers reopen after the COVID-19 lockdown, at the Celesitail Church of Christ, Arch Diocese National Headquarter Makoko, Lagos, as measures against the spread of COVID-19 Coronavirus in Lagos, Nigeria on August 8, 2020 IMAGE SOURCE,GETTY IMAGES Image caption, Most places of worship in African countries have re-opened after the easing of restrictions The first case on the continent was confirmed in Egypt on 14 February. There were fears that the new virus could quickly overwhelm largely fragile health systems on the continent. So, right from the beginning, most African governments took drastic measures to try and slow the spread of the virus. Public health measures - including avoiding handshakes, frequent hand-washing, social distancing and wearing of face masks - were swiftly introduced. Chart showing cases by continent. Updated 3 Oct. 1px transparent line Some countries - like Lesotho - acted even before a single case was reported. It declared an emergency and closed schools on 18 March, and went into a three-week lockdown about 10 days later in unison with many other southern Africa states. But only days after the lockdown was lifted - in early May - did Lesotho find its first confirmed cases. In a population of more than 2 million, it has so far recorded about 1,700 cases and 40 deaths. 2: Public support In a survey conducted in 18 countries in August by PERC, public support for safety measures was high - 85% of respondents said they wore masks in the previous week. ""With strict public health and social measures implemented, African Union member states were able to contain the virus between March and May,"" the report said. It added that ""minor loosening [of restrictions] in June and July coincided with an increase in the reported cases across the continent"". Since then, there has been a notable drop in the number of confirmed cases and deaths in about half of the continent, possibly linked to the end of the southern hemisphere winter (see below).

More and more countries have been forced to re-open their economies even though the number of cases is much higher than when they ordered the shutdowns. According to the PERC report, public opinion about re-opening the economy was mixed - six in 10 respondents said economies needed to re-open, and believed that the risk of getting Covid-19 was minimal if social distancing rules were followed. However, seven in 10 said that thinking about resuming normal activities made them feel anxious. ""The data suggests that people across the AU see Covid-19 as a serious threat, but for many, the economic and social burdens outweigh their personal risk perception of catching the virus,"" concluded the report. How Senegal has managed to keep coronavirus at bay 3: Young population - and few old-age homes The age of the population in most African countries is also likely to have played a role in containing the spread of Covid-19. Globally, most of those who have died have been aged over 80, whileAfrica is home to the world's youngest population with a median age of 19 years, according to UN data. ""The pandemic has largely been in younger age groups... about 91% of Covid-19 infection in sub-Saharan Africa are among people below 60 years and over 80% are asymptomatic,"" said the World Health Organization (WHO).

In comparison, Europe, North America and wealthier Asian countries have the oldest inhabitants. ""One of the big drivers in Western countries is that the elderly people were living in specialized homes and these became places where the transmission was very intense,"" Dr Moeti added. These homes are rare in most African countries, where older people are more likely to be living in rural areas.

IMAGE SOURCE,GETTY IMAGES Image caption, Old-age homes are not common in most African countries It is the norm in many African countries for people to return to their rural homes when they retire from employment in urban areas. The population density in rural areas is lower and therefore maintaining social distance much easier. Furthermore, an underdeveloped transport system within and between countries appears to have been a blessing in disguise. It means that Africans do not travel as much as people do in more developed economies, minimising contact. Debunking fake coronavirus stories in Africa 4: Favourable climate A study conducted by researchers in the University of Maryland in the US found a correlation between temperature, humidity and latitude, and the spread of Covid-19.

But as it became warmer, the number of cases dropped significantly, impacting the continental outlook, as South Africa accounts for almost half the total number of cases and deaths on the continent. 5: Good community health systems The Covid-19 pandemic came at a time when the Democratic Republic of Congo was dealing with its biggest outbreak of Ebola yet. Neighbouring states were on high alert, and the health screening of travellers for Ebola was extended to include Covid-19. Several West African states - which battled the world's worst ever outbreak of Ebola from 2013-16 - had also mastered the public health measures that have been used to prevent Covid-19, including isolating the infected, tracing their contacts and then getting them quarantined while they get tested.

My expertise is needed to serve my community. ""We immediately mobilized the existing polio personnel, tracking contacts and conducting follow-up visits."" So, while hospital infrastructure in much of Africa is less developed than in other parts of the world, the continent's strength lay in its tried and tested community health systems. But all this doesn't mean that people in Africa can afford to relax.

600,253886484532252373720468560041566645993,"Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued the first emergency use authorization (EUA) for a vaccine for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in individuals 16 years of age and older. The emergency use authorization allows the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine to be distributed in the U.S. “The FDA’s authorization for emergency use of the first COVID-19 vaccine is a significant milestone in battling this devastating pandemic that has affected so many families in the United States and around the world,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn, M.D. “Today’s action follows an open and transparent review process that included input from independent scientific and public health experts and a thorough evaluation by the agency’s career scientists to ensure this vaccine met FDA’s rigorous, scientific standards for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality needed to support emergency use authorization. The tireless work to develop a new vaccine to prevent this novel, serious, and life-threatening disease in an expedited timeframe after its emergence is a true testament to scientific innovation and public-private collaboration worldwide.” The FDA has determined that Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine has met the statutory criteria for issuance of an EUA. The totality of the available data provides clear evidence that Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine may be effective in preventing COVID-19. The data also support that the known and potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks, supporting the vaccine’s use in millions of people 16 years of age and older, including healthy individuals. In making this determination, the FDA can assure the public and medical community that it has conducted a thorough evaluation of the available safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality information. The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine contains messenger RNA (mRNA), which is genetic material. The vaccine contains a small piece of the SARS-CoV-2 virus’s mRNA that instructs cells in the body to make the virus’s distinctive “spike” protein. When a person receives this vaccine, their body produces copies of the spike protein, which does not cause disease, but triggers the immune system to learn to react defensively, producing an immune response against SARS-CoV-2. “While not an FDA approval, today’s emergency use authorization of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine holds the promise to alter the course of this pandemic in the United States,” said Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., Director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. “With science guiding our decision-making, the available safety and effectiveness data support the authorization of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine because the vaccine’s known and potential benefits clearly outweigh its known and potential risks. The data provided by the sponsor have met the FDA’s expectations as conveyed in our June and October guidance documents. Efforts to speed vaccine development have not sacrificed scientific standards or the integrity of our vaccine evaluation process. The FDA’s review process also included public and independent review from members of the agency’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee. Today’s achievement is ultimately a testament to the commitment of our career scientists and physicians, who worked tirelessly to thoroughly evaluate the data and information for this vaccine.” FDA Evaluation of Available Safety Data Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine is administered as a series of two doses, three weeks apart. The available safety data to support the EUA include 37,586 of the participants enrolled in an ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled international study, the majority of whom are U.S. participants. These participants, 18,801 of whom received the vaccine and 18,785 of whom received saline placebo, were followed for a median of two months after receiving the second dose. The most commonly reported side effects, which typically lasted several days, were pain at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain, and fever. Of note, more people experienced these side effects after the second dose than after the first dose, so it is important for vaccination providers and recipients to expect that there may be some side effects after either dose, but even more so after the second dose. It is mandatory for Pfizer Inc. and vaccination providers to report the following to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) for Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine: all vaccine administration errors, serious adverse events, cases of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS), and cases of COVID-19 that result in hospitalization or death. FDA Evaluation of Available Effectiveness Data The effectiveness data to support the EUA include an analysis of 36,523 participants in the ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled international study, the majority of whom are U.S. participants, who did not have evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection through seven days after the second dose. Among these participants, 18,198 received the vaccine and 18,325 received placebo. The vaccine was 95% effective in preventing COVID-19 disease among these clinical trial participants with eight COVID-19 cases in the vaccine group and 162 in the placebo group. Of these 170 COVID-19 cases, one in the vaccine group and three in the placebo group were classified as severe. At this time, data are not available to make a determination about how long the vaccine will provide protection, nor is there evidence that the vaccine prevents transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from person to person. The EUA Process On the basis of the determination by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services on February 4, 2020, that there is a public health emergency that has a significant potential to affect national security or the health and security of United States citizens living abroad, and then issued declarations that  circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of unapproved products, the FDA may issue an EUA to allow unapproved medical products or unapproved uses of approved medical products to be used in an emergency to diagnose, treat, or prevent COVID-19 when there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives. The issuance of an EUA is different than an FDA approval (licensure) of a vaccine. In determining whether to issue an EUA for a product, the FDA evaluates the available evidence and assesses any known or potential risks and any known or potential benefits, and if the benefit-risk assessment is favorable, the product is made available during the emergency. Once a manufacturer submits an EUA request for a COVID-19 vaccine to the FDA, the agency then evaluates the request and determines whether the relevant statutory criteria are met, taking into account the totality of the scientific evidence about the vaccine that is available to the FDA. The EUA also requires that fact sheets that provide important information, including dosing instructions, and information about the benefits and risks of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, be made available to vaccination providers and vaccine recipients. The company has submitted a pharmacovigilance plan to FDA to monitor the safety of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. The pharmacovigilance plan includes a plan to complete longer-term safety follow-up for participants enrolled in ongoing clinical trials. The pharmacovigilance plan also includes other activities aimed at monitoring the safety profile of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and ensuring that any safety concerns are identified and evaluated in a timely manner. The FDA also expects manufacturers whose COVID-19 vaccines are authorized under an EUA to continue their clinical trials to obtain additional safety and effectiveness information and pursue approval (licensure). The EUA for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine was issued to Pfizer Inc. The EUA will be effective until the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of the emergency use of drugs and biologics for prevention and treatment of COVID-19 is terminated, and may be revised or revoked if it is determined the EUA no longer meets the statutory criteria for issuance. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.",FDA Takes Key Action in Fight Against COVID-19 By Issuing Emergency Use Authorization for First COVID-19 Vaccine,true
601,74468890951920551951630291730561107596,"The man raises the recording device to his lips.  – Esteban Cabal. November 6, 2020. I have Juan Quesada, from EL PAÍS here…  – Juan Diego.  – Right, Juan Diego. Sorry, do I have your permission to record this conversation?  – Yes, go ahead.  Esteban Cabal is a 62-year-old ecologist. He lives in a beautiful stone house built on a rock, next to a river. On the table in the living room is a thick book called World Government. Its blurb reads: “The conspiracy hatched 300 years ago by the financial elite to take over the world is reaching its end.” Below is a portrait of Cabal, 10 years younger, in a pastoral setting.  “I give a whole series of hints in the book about what was about to transpire and now it has happened,” he says. “I foresee and I explain the ins and outs of real power – of the financial elite.”  Clutching the tome, he claims that all the knowledge he has gathered over the years has helped him come to the following conclusion on the coronavirus pandemic: “It is a fake pandemic invented by the multinational chemical-pharmaceutical companies. This is because they are not only pharmaceutical companies, but large chemical corporations that also manufacture poisons. [...] These multinationals are dedicated to inventing diseases, to making them chronic and turning public health into a lucrative business.”  Cabal has prepared thoroughly for our interview and records it to give to his legal advisors. Within the pages of a spiral notebook, he has written the points he wants to cover in careful handwriting. “I know your boss has sent you here to talk about me, not about my ideas, but my ideas are more important than I am,” he says.  Let’s go with the ideas, then. Three months ago, Cabal created a think tank to advocate an alternative to the official narrative on the coronavirus pandemic. “The official one is absolutely false,” he says. Without going into details, he explains that there are doctors, psychologists, educators, biologists and scientists in his movement who aim to demonstrate that the pandemic is a scam. “A global, monumental [scam] to sell extremely dangerous vaccines that can modify our DNA with unknown consequences,” he says. “If you want to know the truth, I’ll tell you...”  He then starts to read from a word document on his computer. Meanwhile, his dog, an old German shepherd, checks out his visitor before going off to take a nap. Fifteen minutes later, Cabal issues a conclusion, one that divides the world into two separate camps. “The kindest and wisest people are with us and the most malicious people are on the other side, together with the real financial powers.”  Esteban Cabal, last week at his home in Galapagar in the Madrid region. Santiago burgos (EL PAÍS)  He doesn’t make a direct reference to anyone but there are only two people in the room and it is clear what he is getting at.  “Now you will quote from the Barbastro report.”  Cabal is not surprised by the suggestion. Of course he’s going to mention it. It is an internal document by three members of the Barbastro hospital in Huesca drawn up after studying 20 deaths in a nursing home. Their theory is that the use of the synthetic compound polysorbate 80 in flu vaccines could pose a greater risk to patients over 65 who catch the coronavirus. One of the authors of the report, Juan F. Gastón Añaños, has acknowledged that the study was carried out on a very small sample of patients and is in its initial phases. The purpose of the report was to nudge the authorities into investigating further. However, it ended up on the internet and was used by conspiracy theorists and perpetrators of fake news to spread erroneous, or at least, precipitous, conclusions.  Cabal is convinced of the conspiracy and adds that the study “determines that the component that has caused the devastating mortality [during the pandemic] is polysorbate 80, which is a detergent and an ingredient in some vaccines – only in those that are given to the civilian population, not to doctors.” There is no proof that this is the case.  The conversation continues. Cabal also refers to one of the conspiracy theories that went viral during the spring lockdown – that Italian doctors had allegedly discovered that the problem was not the virus but rather a bacterium that kills via thrombosis rather than pneumonia. “If it were not for those Italian doctors, we would all have died,” he says. The theory has some connection to reality: Italian doctors discovered in 50 autopsies of Covid-19 patients in Italy that the coronavirus not only causes pneumonia, but also other life-threatening conditions, including thrombosis.  Cabal claims to have first-hand information proving the mortality statistics in Spain have been invented. A nephew of his, a Shaolin monk, was living in Wuhan province in China when the pandemic broke. Apparently, he escaped the lockdown by a day, fleeing to the countryside where he survived with no money or food until he was able to get back to Spain. “He speaks perfect Chinese,” says Cabal with pride.  The sun shines on Cabal’s vegetable patch outside. The sky has suddenly cleared. Cabal turns off his recording device. He walks around his garden, indicating the vegetables that he will have to pick before the frost starts. The rushing of the river is audible in the background. We go down to look at it and he points out signs of wild boar. In the distance, a native species of donkey in danger of extinction can be seen in the distance.  Holding a handful of earth, he talks about his years at the head of a political party called Los Verdes (The Greens) when he was a counselor in the Rivas-Vaciamadrid city council. Before that, there were dark years of political struggle. Cabal was tortured by Antonio González Pacheco aka Billy El Niño or Billy the Kid, an infamous police inspector during the Franco dictatorship. After that, he fled to France with little more than the shirt on his back. “I was only a boy,” he says.  When we get back to his house, he opens the automatic gate at the entrance. It’s time to say goodbye. As a parting shot, Cabal says, “Be careful – very soon we will be the majority and the prime minister of Spain will be one of us.”  ***  The protest called by a small group of coronavirus skeptics last Saturday in Madrid. Olmo Calvo  Sonia Vescovacci, a police officer on unpaid leave, holds a microphone in her hands. All around her are Spanish flags, signs with anti-communist and anti-vaccine slogans and the all-seeing eye from the Big Brother TV show. This afternoon, investor George Soros, Bill Gates, Melinda Gates and Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez are being constantly blamed for the pandemic.  Vescovacci draws breath, then tells the crowd: “We took an oath to serve and protect citizens, not to repress them. That is our principal duty. Again we say to ministers and the main chiefs of police that the Police for Freedom movement is offering to collaborate in any investigation that serves to clarify why our relatives and neighbors are dying and demand that those who act against life be held responsible.”  The crowd cheers. Coronavirus denialism, once confined to the internet, is now beginning to spill out onto the streets. Last Saturday, the fledgling Police for Freedom movement launched a protest that brought around a thousand people together in Madrid. According to the organizers, its supporters include Civil Guard officers, municipal and regional officers, firemen and security guards. In reality, there are no more than 10 police officers marching through the city alongside members of the public who learned of the protest on social media and websites that share fake news. Observers look on at the marchers in disbelief.  “We are normal people, not freaks,” says Cabal, who was among the protestors – a melting pot of the far left, the far right, addicts of UFO documentaries, anarchists, ecologists, YouTubers and even members of spiritual movements. “The Chinese communist regime is at the root of the problem,” says Maya Marinova, 54, a member of the Falun Gong religious movement. “Now Spain is copying its methods.”  Most of the protesters believe that the coronavirus does not exist despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, arguing instead that it is a conspiracy cooked up by governments and multinationals to control ordinary people.  Estalin Orlando, a 24-year-old computer consultant, carried a banner proposing a collective of geniuses as a solution to the “organized and violent conspiracy to install a dictatorship” using the pandemic as an excuse. “It will be a government of competent people voted by competent people,” he says. “There are people voting now without the competence to do so. That is a mediocracy. With the geniocracy, the level of love and empathy shown by those governing will be taken into account.” He adds that his parents listen to him carefully, but encourage him to focus and study and work. “They are more conventional,” he explains.  But not all of the protesters dismiss the existence of the virus. Maxi, a 54-year-old psychologist, says the virus is killing a lot of people – “whole families.” However, he believes that politicians are taking advantage of the situation to repress the public: “We’re not going to stand for that anymore.”  The protest ended at the Neptune fountain on the Paseo del Prado where people who had only met previously online hugged for the first time. Vescovacci, meanwhile, was keen to give the floor to anyone with something to say. The speeches went on for an hour-and-a-half.  ***  Fernando Vizcaíno travels around Spain in his van. The sign in the windscreen reads: “Scam-virus.”  Wearing hiking boots, a violet hippy sweatshirt and a beard, Fernando Vizcaíno, 42, drives an old white van he sometimes spends the night in, stretching out on a mat in the back. This way, no one can lock him down – it is his stand for freedom.  – I thought they were going to lock us down earlier, but what we’re doing is having an effect. The public is becoming aware of many things and not just our work. This is going to collapse under its own weight and your heads are going to roll if you don’t change your tune.  – Literally?  – Noooo, but the first to go to jail will be the journalists. And the politicians.  Vizcaíno has a YouTube channel which he uses to spread conspiracy theories about the pandemic. In fact, right now he is secretly recording our conversation from inside the van. Later, he will upload it to his channel. While the videos don’t have millions of views, they do have a loyal audience that leaves comments. It is this audience he is referring to when he says the public is finally waking up.  He drives through the streets of Guadarrama, 50 odd kilometers from Madrid, until the tarmac road peters out, and he parks. An icy draft comes in through his windows. On the windscreen, he has a sign that says, “Timovirus” – a combination of the Spanish word for scam (timo) and virus. He claims to be waging a counter-information war on the media with an endless stream of anti-pandemic messages.  Vizcaíno explains that he lived “as a hermit” for 20 years in Latin America. He says he got used to rural life, dedicating himself to writing, introspection, personal development and nature. He learned a lot, he says, both about himself and about human beings in general. He was in Valencia when the March lockdown was declared. “I have always done what I wanted; I have been free; I have not been a part of the system. The only time in my life I have made Social Security payments was when I was 18 for two months. When I saw that they were shutting us up in our homes – when I saw what they were trying to do, I said, ‘Shit, they’re going to take away our freedom.’ That’s what got me started. After that, I realized what they were doing – you can see that they are killing old people.”  What?  “With polisorbate 80,” he says. Once again the Barbastro report is being used and manipulated to back the denialist argument. It’s the same line as the one used by Cabal, the one that is circulating on social networks. Word for word. “This disease doesn’t even exist,” he continues. “The virus has not been isolated or purified. It has not even been proven that Sars-CoV-2 exists. It is the symptomatology that the flu vaccine once caused. If you look closely, nobody is dying anymore from typical pneumonia as they were doing. According to the media and governments, Covid-19 continues to kill people, but it turns out that it no longer kills like that. How come?”  He hopes that people will wake up and embrace the same truth he has found. The youth protests against the coronavirus restrictions that have occurred in recent weeks could be a good start, but Vizcaíno believes these are also suspect. “The system’s agents are closing down everything,” he says. “The protests are now being appropriated by the government for its own ends. These people are not us.” As far as Vizcaíno is concerned, everything is a lie; the world is a farce, a show. Through this lens, the two women we see going for a hike equipped with sneakers and trekking poles start to seem threatening; they could be spies.  Before our meeting, Vizcaíno shared links, videos and documents via the instant-message service Telegram that, according to him, prove his theories. He claims they will not be published because they would reach the public and discredit the official narrative. The reality is that everything he sends is already circulating on social networks, just a click away from anyone who cares to take a look, and has already been widely proven to be false.  The denier label is not one that Vizcaíno relishes. “It’s silly. From where I’m standing, you are the denier,” he says. So what about the overwhelmed hospitals, the crematoriums that were working 24-hours a day, the bodies of the elderly waiting in beds for days until being taken by the funeral authorities?  Vizcaíno doesn’t miss a beat. He claims: “I have two doctors, one from La Paz [hospital] and one from Alcorcón, and when you mention the hospitals that have reached breaking point they say that the hospitals around the city of Madrid were empty. They staged a circus to terrorize the population. The official doctors acknowledge this, but they also remain silent.”  Twenty-four hours later, he will have the audio of the interview uploaded to YouTube with a short introduction. Sitting behind the wheel, he states that he is doing this “to help publish the truth.” Of the more than 360 comments he gets, most are overwhelmingly in his favor. The former hermit has found his niche. “In the last few months, I’ve been on the phone all day, and at the computer because a lot of people are getting in touch with me,” he says. “Telegram, video editing – doing things all day long. From the moment I get up until I go to bed.”  ***  Sonia Vescovaccia, a former police officer, at the protest on Saturday.  Sonia Vescovacci is in blue. She has a megaphone. She asks people at the demonstration to keep a two-meter distance and not to lower their masks; not because she believes it’s useful, but to avoid getting those policing the event – her former colleagues – into trouble. In a short space of time, especially on YouTube, she has become a familiar face to police officers who share her videos, which challenge the police authorities and question the pandemic.  She says she is not a coronavirus denier, like Esteban Cabal and Fernando Vizcaíno. However, she goes on to voice her doubts. “I don’t know if it is a virus, if it is 5G [a conspiracy theory that went viral online linking the virus to the introduction of 5G mobile technology] or what it is. We don’t know what’s behind it exactly. We don’t think the truth is being told. We have our own criteria and we question if what they are telling us is real.”  Vescovacci, 41, has only recently embraced these ideas. When she went on leave from the police, she wanted to start a project to improve police training. During her master’s degree in entrepreneurship, she set up an initiative called Human Protect. The idea was to incorporate courses on emotional intelligence, mindfulness, verbal defense and persuasion into police training. She started offering these courses to the unions, but saw from the outset that there was not much interest. She applied for a grant from the police foundation, without success. She sent a proposal for Human Protect to Ávila, where the national police academy is located, with the same result. It was a dead end.  Recently separated from her husband – also a police officer – and caring for her mother, she decided to start a YouTube channel. Her first three videos were reasonably well received. She claims that the first one earned her disciplinary action that will be applied when she decides to return to the force, which she says she can do when she chooses. Her videos have dramatic headlines, such as “THE TRUTH, THE BIG LIES, THE REALITY.” The creation of Police for Freedom, a movement that has been established with the help of a municipal police officer, has brought these slogans to the streets. Saturday was her first rally and she was satisfied with the result. She believes that the movement has a future. Like Alice in Wonderland, Vescovacci has gone through the looking glass and she has people on board at last.

Over 40 targets were hit by Turkish jets and artillery, and there are reports of civilian casualities.  Quoting YPG forces, a stringer for the VOA Kurdish Service in Afrin reported that three Turkish military tanks were destroyed in the nearby towns of Bilbil and Shara.  Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim says the objective of Operation Olive Branch was to establish a 30-kilometer security cordon inside the Afrin area to protect Turkish towns from attacks. Ankara accuses the Kurdish militia YPG, which controls Afrin, of being linked to an insurgency inside Turkey. The militia is a key ally of Turkey's U.S. NATO partner in its war against the Islamic State.  Yildirim claimed a rocket attack on Saturday on the Turkish border town of Kilis underscored the need for the cordon. During the attack, two houses and a workplace were hit, and one person was slightly wounded.  On Sunday, another border town — Reyhanli — was reportedly hit by rockets. Turkish media also reported that Turkish soldiers had clashed with Kurdish militia forces three kilometers inside Syria. The YPG claimed it had repelled a Turkish attack. No casualty figures have been released.  Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, speaking to thousands of supporters in the city of Bursa Sunday, claimed the operation was proceeding successfully.  ""Our jets took off and started bombing. And now, the ground operation is under way. Now, we see how the YPG ... are fleeing in Afrin,"" Erdogan said. ""We will chase them. God willing, we will complete this operation very quickly.""  Ankara appears to be expediting the operation as it faces growing diplomatic pushback. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson urged Turkey to ""exercise restraint"" and avoid killing or injuring civilians. His comments came in phone conversations with his Russian and Turkish counterparts on Saturday. He said Turkey's ""legitimate security concerns"" must be addressed and urged officials to remain focused on the goal of defeating IS.  On Sunday, Paris announced it was calling for an emergency meeting of the United Nation's Security Council.  ""Ghouta, Idlib, Afrin — France asks for an urgent meeting of the Security Council,"" wrote French Foreign Minister Yves Le Drian on Twitter. He also said he had spoken Sunday with his Turkish counterpart, Mevlut Cavusolgu.  ""This fighting ... must stop,"" saidFrench Defense Minister Florence Parly on France 3 television Sunday, warning that the Turkish offensive could interfere in the war against IS.  The pushback by Paris may have surprised Ankara, according to political columnist Semih Idiz of the Al Monitor website. He noted French President Emmanuel Macron recently hosted his Turkish counterpart in Paris in a meeting heralded in Ankara as the defining of new relationship with France.  Macron is again establishing himself as a world leader, said political columnist Cengiz Aktar. He said if the security council views these actions as a threat to peace, it could put Turkey ""in a very difficult position and unsustainable position."" Aktar says with France being likely viewed as neutral by the other security members, it would enhance the chances of the success in any vote.

The speeches condemn the YPG Kurdish militia and describe the operation in heavy nationalist rhetoric as a battle for the future of the nation. Erdogan also criticizes Washington.

He is openly challenging the United States. He has ""crossed the Rubicon"" and ""won't be able to go back now [past U.S.-Turkish relations),"" warned Aktar.

May God help our army and our soldiers.""  The country's second-largest opposition party, the pro-Kurdish HDP, finds itself as the only mainstream party opposing the operation — a stance that is putting the party under growing pressure.  At a rally Sunday, Erdogan warned: ""HDP calls for demonstrations against the Afrin campaign. Do not go out to the square. Those who come out of the square will pay a heavy price.""  The party's co-leaders are already in jail on terrorism charges, along with thousands of its officials.  There have been few demonstrations against the Afrin military operation in Turkey.

604,138479109015113776387811964986651898271,"As news and misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic has spread, many Americans have encountered conflicting narratives about how the new coronavirus originated. Scientists have determined the virus came about naturally, but there is some uncertainty about how it first infected people.  While a plurality of Americans (43%) say the new coronavirus most likely came about naturally, nearly three-in-ten (29%) say it most likely was created in a lab, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted from March 10 to 16, 2020, as part of the Center’s nearly yearlong Election News Pathways project.  Around a quarter of adults (23%) say it is most likely that the current strain of coronavirus was developed intentionally in a lab; another 6% say it was most likely made accidentally in a lab. A quarter say they aren’t sure where the virus originated.  To explore the extent to which misinformation has made its way into the news people get about the COVID-19 outbreak, we focused on the belief of some Americans that the virus was created in a lab. We used data from a survey of 8,914 U.S. adults conducted March 10 to 16, 2020, as part of the Center’s nearly yearlong Election News Pathways project. All survey participants are members of the Center’s American Trends Panel, a nationally representative online survey panel. Panelists were recruited by telephone or mail so that nearly every U.S. adult has a known chance of being selected. The data is weighted to further ensure it reflects the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Here are the questions asked for this report, along with responses, and its methodology. Visit our interactive data tool to access the data on the coronavirus pandemic and other issues related to news and the election.  Americans differ by age, education level and race and ethnicity when it comes to who believes that the virus was created in a lab:  Younger adults are more likely than older people to say the virus was developed in a lab. For example, about a third of adults ages 18 to 29 say the virus was developed in a lab (35%), compared with 21% of adults 65 and older. Nearly four-in-ten (39%) adults under 30 say it came about naturally, while 51% of those 65 and older say this.  Educational attainment is also a factor. Those with a bachelor’s degree or more education are less likely than those with a high school diploma or less education to say the coronavirus was created in a lab (19% vs. 35%). A majority (61%) of those with at least a bachelor’s degree say the virus came about naturally, compared with 31% of those with a high school diploma or less.  The belief that the coronavirus was created in a lab also is more prevalent among Hispanic and black Americans than among whites. About four-in-ten Hispanic adults (39%) say the virus was created in a lab. Among black adults, 34% say the same. Around a quarter of white adults (26%) say it was developed in a lab.  When it comes to political affiliation and ideology, Republicans and Republican-leaning independents are more likely than Democrats and Democratic leaners to say the coronavirus was created in a lab (37% vs. 21%). About four-in-ten conservative Republicans say this (39%), the largest share of any ideological group.  Confusion surrounding these facts parallels Americans’ overall experience with misinformation during the outbreak. About half of U.S. adults (48%) report having come across at least some news and information about COVID-19 that seemed completely made up, with 12% saying they have seen a lot of it and 35% saying they have seen some.

However as he was speaking to other physicians, he was not breaking the industry code of conduct.  Gates has three children with his wife Melinda – Jennifer, Rory and Phoebe – born between 1996 and 2002, and according to his former doctor, they are all unvaccinated and healthy.  The news that Bill Gates does not vaccinate his own children, despite being the world’s most active campaigner for mandatory vaccinations, should come as no surprise.

609,189700315351432315169761694613833047445,"A customer leaves an SAQ outlet on Jan. 6, the same day the Quebec government announced that vaccine passports will be required to enter all government liquor stores and cannabis outlets as of Jan. 18.Ryan Remiorz/The Canadian Press  Legal experts say Quebec’s plan to expand its vaccine passport requirement to include cannabis and liquor stores is likely legally sound, but may still face challenges from groups opposed to vaccine mandates.  Quebec’s government announced on Thursday that proof of vaccination will be required in provincially run liquor and cannabis stores as of Jan. 18, and warned that other non-essential services, such as shopping malls and hair salons, could be next. The measures are part of an effort to push more Quebeckers to get COVID-19 vaccines.  Officials have blamed the unvaccinated, who make up the majority of COVID-19 patients in hospitals, for straining the province’s health care system. Quebec’s passport requirements already apply to restaurants, gyms and other locations where people gather for recreation.  Under a COVID-19 curfew in Montreal, a lonely doorman stands watch over an empty city  A glimpse into Quebec’s COVID-19 curfew on four dark nights in two lonely cities  COVID-19 hospitalizations look different in the Omicron wave, and vaccination status is playing a part  Cheryl Milne, a constitutional lawyer and executive director of the Asper Centre for Constitutional Rights at the University of Toronto, said the expansion of vaccine passports would likely stand up to any legal challenges, because unvaccinated people will still be able to access alcohol and cannabis through private retailers and delivery services.  “Obviously, they’re thinking they need to step up pressure on people who are refusing to be vaccinated,” Ms. Milne said.  “It’s untested at this point, but so far the courts, when looking at vaccine mandates or restrictions on liberty rights such as travel, have mostly sided with the provinces, who are trying to ensure vaccine compliance or public health measures to stop the spread of the virus.”  Ms. Milne said the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms gives governments a great deal of agency to make decisions like these, especially in emergency situations such as pandemics.  Quebec has reported a spike in appointments for first doses of vaccines since the announcement – a sign the strategy is working. The province’s Ministry of Health and Social Services said 6,000 people booked first-dose appointments on Thursday, and an additional 3,000 did so by 5:30 p.m. on Friday. The ministry said there were around 1,500 daily first-dose bookings before the announcement.  On Friday, Quebec’s College of Physicians said in a statement that the government should use the vaccine passport system to further limit access to a large number of shops and public places.  François Vincent, the Canadian Federation of Independent Business’s vice-president for Quebec, criticized the idea of expanding the vaccine passport requirement to include more types of retail spaces. He said the move would put undue staffing and financial strain on businesses that are already struggling.  Legal experts say Quebec’s plans to expand its vaccine passport requirement to cannabis and liquor stores may face legal challenges, but they think the policies are legally sound.CHRISTINNE MUSCHI/Reuters  He argued that the government should reconsider the policy, or at least cover business owners’ additional staffing and equipment costs if they are required to enforce vaccine mandates.  “The strategy is to get people to get vaccinated, but you’re asking the private sector to do the job without giving them the tools,” he said.  Ms. Milne said jurisdictions may find themselves in muddier water if they begin restricting access to more essential services, such as grocery stores, based on vaccination status.  But she said courts could still rule in favour of those measures if the highly infectious Omicron variant of COVID-19 creates an even more dire situation in the country – or if a new, deadlier variant begins wreaking havoc.  Amir Attaran, a professor with both the faculty of law and the school of epidemiology at the University of Ottawa, said there is no legal barrier to federal and provincial governments making vaccines fully mandatory for most members of the general public.  Federal Health Minister Jean-Yves Duclos at a briefing on Friday nudged provinces and territories toward having conversations about that type of sweeping mandatory vaccination regime, saying it’s possible such a policy could become reality in the future.  Mr. Attaran said the most likely legal challenge to a broad vaccine mandate would have to do with the idea that it violated Section 7 of the Charter, which guarantees personal autonomy through the right to life, liberty and security. But he said that section places limits on individual rights if they affect another person’s life, liberty and security. It would be possible to argue that a strong vaccine mandate falls under that exemption, he said.  “The governments in Canada have yet to lose a lawsuit” regarding vaccine mandates, he added.  “As long as they set up a mechanism whereby persons having a medical or religious reason not to vaccinate are accorded reasonable exemptions, then they’ve demonstrated fundamental justice.”  Frank Addario, a Toronto lawyer, also said the new vaccine passport rules are legally sound, but he noted that it’s vital for any government to increase its educational messaging if it ratchets up the severity of its vaccine laws.  He pointed out that people who are vaccine hesitant are often from marginalized communities. Some of them, he said, are Black and Indigenous people, who have reasons to distrust Canadian authority figures.  “If I’m designing it as a lawyer and I want to win, then we’ve got to do a really good job on getting out there and showing that we have really worked hard to reach into all these communities where we have not succeeded,” Mr. Addario said. He added that inflammatory rhetoric toward the unvaccinated could hurt governments in court.

Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia's war in Ukraine. ArrowRight The move comes as Quebec, like other population centers in Canada and the United States, is seeing case counts rise rapidly. And though the province’s vaccination rate is near 80 percent — one of the world’s highest — hospitalizations are spiking, especially among the unvaccinated, and threatening to overwhelm hospitals, officials said.  The new requirement for patrons entering cannabis and liquor stores takes effect on Jan. 18. It will aim to persuade more Quebecois to get vaccinated, Dubé said, and thereby minimize the number of people being hospitalized for covid-19.  Advertisement  Quebec already requires people to present proof of vaccination when entering health-care facilities, indoor sports venues, movie theaters, bars and nightclubs. Exemptions apply to children under 13 and certain adults. As part of efforts to curb new infections, Quebec also has a curfew that runs from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m.  “Yes, this is very difficult right now,” Dubé told reporters. “But we are [taking] all the measures, [to] make sure that we minimize the impact on our personnel, on our system.”  In early December, Canada’s seven-day average of newly reported infections was about 3,000, figures compiled by Our World in Data show. That number is now about 40,000. Quebec, home to Canada’s second-most-populous city, Montreal, has seen cases rise at a similar pace.  Dubé said Quebec’s latest preventive measure is not meant to irritate the unvaccinated, as French President Emmanuel Macron recently pledged to do. “It would be nice” to make them angry, he said, but Quebec’s policies primarily aim to reduce their contact with the immunized population — and to protect the unvaccinated from one another.  Advertisement  By mid-January, the number of Quebec’s covid-19 hospital patients may increase to 3,000 from the current 2,000, Dubé said. Those in need of intensive care may double, from about 200 to 400, in that span, he added. Quebec’s intensive-care capacity is 319 beds, according to a Montreal Gazette report on Wednesday.  About a fifth of Quebec’s 8.5 million people are not vaccinated. But they account for about half of the patients in intensive care, Dubé said. “We’re going to make sure they understand very well that if they can’t get vaccinated, then they should stay home.”  Read more:  GiftOutline Gift Article","Quebec’s cannabis, liquor stores to require coronavirus vaccination proof",true
